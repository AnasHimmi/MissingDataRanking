DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one way or the other in the way he said in his statement," Grindel said on the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" in the "Bild" newspaper.
Despite the months-long debate over the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-times national player Özil.
"I would have been delighted if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case,"Grindel said.
In July, the 29-year-old declared his resignation from the DFB team and justified it by saying that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready to talk to German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so that "when you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation hasn't come to fruition so far."

Restitution from the Ethnological Museum to Native People in Alaska decided
The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation (SPK) will return nine objects from the collection of the Ethnological Museum of the State Museums in Berlin to the Chugach Alaska Corporation.
The Board of Trustees has today approved a proposal from the President.
The objects are burial objects from Native People in southwest Alaska.
They were among those objects brought to Berlin by Johan Adrian Jacobsen, who travelled the American North West Coast and Alaska between 1882 and 1884 on behalf of what was then the Royal Museum of Ethnology (now the Ethnological Museum).
Hermann Parzinger, president of the SPK, said:
"The objects were unlawfully taken from the graves of their deceased without the consent of the Native People at the time, so they do not belong in our museums."
"We will now return you to the Chugach Alaska Corporation, which we have been working with since 2015 to revise our collection."
In the future, the restitute objects will be presented in the Chugach community, including the annual Chugach Spirit Camp, which serves to exchange knowledge between the generations and the various tribes that are now part of the Chugach community.
As part of John Johnson's current visit to Berlin, a memorandum of understanding with the Ethnological Museum was also prepared.
The objects are burial objects from Chenega Island and the now unknown town of Sanradna in Kachemak Bay.
Among them are two broken masks and a child's weigh, as well as a wooden idol.
Masks were usually burned after use or placed in graves, which is why today there are no longer many masks of the Chugach.
The red color on them refers to the funeral context.
The wooden idol is presumably a shamanic figure who should protect people from danger and death.
In total, the Ethnological Museum owns just over 200 Chugach objects.
In the Chugach region of southwest Alaska, people who call themselves Sugpiaq or Alutiiq have lived for several thousand years, and were formerly known as Pacific Eskimos.
About 1,000 to 1,500 years ago, groups of Indians, now known as Dena'ina (formerly known as Tanaina), also immigrated to the country.
Today, the Alaskan natives, who call themselves Chugach, live around the Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet.
They live in seven communities: Chenega, Eyak, Nanwalek, Port Graham, Seward, Tatilek and Valdez.
Regular contacts with Europe have existed since the time of Tsar Peter the Great.
In November 2015, a delegation from the Chugach Alaska Corporation visited the Ethnological Museum with the aim of initiating cooperation for future projects.
The background was, among other things, the interest in creating a virtual collection of all Chugach objects around the world.
Subsequently, the corporation asked the Ethnological Museum to assist in the repatriation of any existing burial objects in the region.
The Chugach Alaska Corporation (www.chugach-ak.com) is an advocacy group of Native People in the Chugach region of Alaska, which has been in existence since 1972.
Among other things, it is committed to preserving the cultural heritage of these groups.
The US government supported the request for restitution with a diplomatic note.
In accordance with its basic approach to dealing with its non-European collections and the study of provenance, the SPK carefully examined the context from which the burial objects, which are located in the Ethnological Museum, originate.
In this case, all indications are that the objects are from a burial plot and an unauthorised archaeological excavation.
From Adrian Jacobsen's travel diaries, it is clear that the graves were opened only for the purpose of extracting their contents.

Johan Adrian Jacobsen travelled to the American Northwest Coast and Alaska at the end of the 19th century for the Museum of Ethnology in Berlin.
The director of the museum, Adolf Bastian, had commissioned him, for the purpose of building a collection, to collect as many "original" items as possible, uninfluenced by European culture.
Jacobsen brought around 3,000 objects from the northwest coast and around 4,000 objects from Alaska to Berlin.

Treysa has to contend with vandalism and indecency.
The entrance to the 36-kilometre long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are scarcely emerging.
Shards, cigarette butts, rubbish and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
A more than disgraceful sight for the flagship railway bike path in Rotkäppchenland.
The topic has been a long-standing concern for members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt, as well as others, according to the city's cycling commissioner, Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The issue has already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Council.
So far, there is no solution.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste bins and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the issue to the local council.
It's not just the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but it also destroys the floors: Posts are torn out of the ground, rubbish bins are demolished, signs are buckled around, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
However, the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is the meeting place for Saufgelage.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "This may set the threshold significantly higher for grabbing public property.
However, this would require a police patrol to pass in a timely manner.

It must be made more attractive.
You can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.

Music contest at the cultural station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in togetherness.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering for coffee and cake from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a longtime Albanian living in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not seen this before in other parts of the city.
What were the lyrics connected to?
The towns of Hiltruper See and Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his striking song.
The cultural station was also honoured.
Time and again, it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
For example, Humberg was told that he had actually studied chemistry, but was now also teaching guitar.
Franke knew from sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the programme.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has put all sorts of things on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury, however, there was something special - so that others could listen to their songs as well.
An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hitter, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "A very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again for the final - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KVG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the city's district offensive.
The city council offensive launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.

The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red foil - can only be deciphered once you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side will not be able to read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Dice.
4."Feast."
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
It is not the terms that are to be guessed, but the codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card that says "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto," it is not the terms behind the secret film that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice," "feast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, as far as possible, win the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encoder notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice,"lots" as opposed to feast; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible, and "Prague" because he was watching at school and knew the window fall there.
That's how it goes round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can rhyme them better with any hint the encryption gives there.
So the rewrites should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise you will make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rulebook.
The players will probably have to study it in detail for quite a long time before they can finally play.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the "Dream Ship."
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series may have been complicit in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series, which made her a star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many colleagues I admired perceived me on an equal footing,"Keller says in an interview with" Bild am Sonntag."
At first, she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "Dream Ship."
For now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time may well have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans also shunned conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be "the only right person" for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I have changed my mind,"she explains.
She always felt she was "not good enough for him."

Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association list ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His protégés were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bust - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.

Football: District league: VfL Wolbeck's performance against SC Altenrheine is encouraging
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went hard on the court with his teammates.
Word-for-word, he, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, retired first (internally) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
Everything is history.
In the meantime, it is running around the Brandhoveweg again.
The 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine is a testament to the success of the game, which has only been skinny in the past season.
Yes, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen,"Fetsch praised his boys and asked each individual for the match, simply to say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly moved into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited in front for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first leg.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs missed the lead before his exit (17th), the changed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th).
Almost that would have been revenge when the SCA struck twice in the 41st minute in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his field.
After the break, the VfL happily took full control.
Thewes from 18 metres narrowly failed.
Schroer, too, came too late after 58 minutes when Thewes came in.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch again missed a fresh cell cure on the left.
When Altenrhein's Chris Naberbäumer felled Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free-kick for the placegetters 18 metres in front of the guest house.
The foul-mouthed man stepped on his own and demonstrated his dangerousness to standards.
Westhues "thing with the right slap hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
Another 20 minutes, which should be damn long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck unhappily flipped the leather in the penalty area in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to survive a few minutes in the closing stages before Geske had the winning goal on the puck from 12 metres in the 87th minute.
Perhaps it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season bust: "Shitty situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth consecutive Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, there was not much to see before in the 1-4 (0-2) final of the table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96-year-old footballer Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "It's disappointing, of course, because you always take a lot of action."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86) joined, are at the bottom with two points and are a runner-up in their current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated its first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio in Rome, moved into the middle of the table with seven points.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action by Hesse in his starting debut and never got to grips with Hanover's defence.
The striker, who has been struggling for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was also in the initial formation of the Frankfurt club for the first time.
A header deflected onto the goal net by Lucas Torró (17) put him in danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller, in a promising position, was stopped at the last moment by the 96-man defence around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-handed Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords was almost inevitable and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extended his header in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for the defender, who arrived in the summer from French second-tier side AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt slumped before the break.
This time, Haller matched up with his Storm partner Rebic, who skilfully kicked and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser with no chance.
In the second half Hanover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played a bit more courageously forward, but igniting ideas remained until just before the end, when the final result was achieved.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After less than an hour Rebic started a solo and then put the ball across to De Guzmán, who had only to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a show run for the Frankfurt fans against overstretched guests, and Jovic also hit a minute before the end.
The summer itself was also unusually wet.

Inauguration: New home in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life support Donau-Iller is opening a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" will now be handed over to its destination in Münsterblickstraße - all those present agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the home of the life support company Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas in his concept.
The first planning began around eight years ago, when the former US Army officer's building was put to the test for residents with a mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in the equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators arrived to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed to be as friendly and bright as possible, so that residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life support Donau-Iller opens new home
Life support invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, while the district of Swabia contributed 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The managing director of life support, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
However, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allowed the residents to experience the freedom to move without foreign help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, the head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, said similarly: "The house is geared to the special needs of its residents, who need help to be mobile."
At the same time, the comfort and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And he added: "The property in this situation is a real stroke of luck, because it is no longer available in the current situation."
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblickstraße offers space on almost 1500 square metres for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three residential groups.
Heinz, managing director of life support, is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed on a tariff basis.

Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But there have been riots before.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and the police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence protesters with paint powder, among other things, as they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to use a rally to honour their colleagues who were deployed to the polling stations last year in what was considered an illegal referendum.

The Catalan police have formed a chain to keep the separatist and central security forces' demonstrations separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6,000 or so separatists then tried to break through the police chain by force and threw paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, the authorities said.

Smears with local political message: No successful advertisement for skate equipment
In Lengerich, unknown people have advertised the construction of a skate facility in a way that is hardly conducive.
There are corresponding lubricants in several places, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint has been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" Are emblazoned on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering has already been discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro after the trade fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an edding at the time, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, it was back, this time sprayed on," Rottmann said.
He assumes that the appropriate advertising sign will have to be replaced.
This particular case is particularly noteworthy by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the city's school, sport and culture department, without mentioning names.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.

Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we have had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm will come," the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-standing staffing shortage in European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick fix.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots will take four to five years," said the trade unionist.

Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the pilot malaise.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period, which runs until 2019, were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and staff savings in national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut the air even further" for air traffic control.
At the moment, the EU guidelines are being voted on by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is under constant lobbying pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," said Maas.
He said he hoped the high cost of delays for airlines would lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German air traffic control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," said Maas.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilots per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.

Public procurement of construction services and corruption prevention
Joint report by the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The award of services by public authorities is of great importance to both the state and the economy.
The state has the task of using public funds as economically and economically as possible, as well as ensuring fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by public authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure that competition is largely unrestricted across borders, public authorities must comply with EU rules when awarding contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, EU member states must transpose and apply the EU's public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The award of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
Due to the generally high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue favours when awarding their contracts.
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to carry out parallel audits both for the award of construction services across the EU and for the prevention of corruption.
The audits focused on the application of EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national legislation, as well as the prevention of corruption in the awarding of construction services in construction, road construction and transport infrastructure.
The awards below the EU thresholds have also been included in the discussions with a view to preventing corruption.
The audit results of both auditors are summarised in this joint report.
The report will also be addressed to international bodies, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the topics listed are mainly based on cross-sectional tests carried out in 2011 / 2012 by the building authorities, which are responsible for the road and construction of the federal government in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and major construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Audit Office drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on test knowledge from 2008 to 2011, which included construction work in road construction, rail infrastructure construction, water construction, construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) and other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
The awarding of federal public contracts in Germany is carried out predominantly by the building administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Building Administration is centrally responsible for the procurement of transport infrastructure.
In the construction sector, the awards are carried out decentrally by those bodies that use the state budget.
In both countries, freelance workers are also involved in some areas of procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in procurement law and the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.
Development of public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national sector are governed by budgetary law and the administrative rules that are based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national awards, many complementary individual schemes are provided for by internal administrative provisions.
Such as the so-called "public procurement manuals" of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or further formulated in accordance with the procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the public procurement law and other statutory provisions, which apply both above and below the EU thresholds.
The public procurement law was significantly amended in 2012.
The new rules increased transparency in the use of public funds, allowed greater competition and limited the opportunities for corruption in the procurement process.
Broad outlines of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure must be applied to EU-wide contracts.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold are to be applied to the national types of contracts (public tender, limited tender, hands-free award), which are broadly in line with the aforementioned EU-wide types of contracts.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (for contracts to be carried out across the EU) and the public tender (for national contracts).
In the open procedure and in the public tender process, any interested company can make an offer.
Another key feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises.
This is mainly due to the division of an overall construction measure into specialist and partial units.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the above-mentioned features of German public procurement law are proven tools for achieving economic results.
In Germany, there are over 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees.
In the Czech Republic, the EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable to construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception is the simplified procedure, which allows a less stringent procedure to be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law, in line with EU law, provides for contracts to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow the contracting authorities to choose between open and non-open procedures.
There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 are companies with 20 or more employees.
Volume of public procurement contracts and shares of public procurement in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.
Of these, 45.5 billion euros were spent on public construction (15%), which, in addition to federal construction, includes in particular the construction activities of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in construction and road construction (excluding rail infrastructure construction and water construction) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction services in the construction and road construction of the federal government was distributed among the types of contracts awarded in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and limited tenders, and 6.6% negotiation procedures and hands-free tenders.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide awards.
The volume of public works in the Czech Republic in 2011 amounted to 4.7 billion euros, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, representing 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011:65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiation procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for order volumes below the 2.7% threshold for other procedures
The data relate to all public contracts for supplies, services and construction services awarded by public procurement bodies in 2011.
The above data show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on a significant proportion of public contracts, which have a major financial impact on the prevention of corruption to be observed in all contracts, and that the open procedure and public tender are of paramount importance in the award of contracts.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries for the award of construction services across the EU and for the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both auditors compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of construction and road construction.
They found that:
The EU directives on the award of construction services by public contractors have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (paragraphs 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, corruption prevention is also served by the procurement regulations of both countries, which differ in part in their priorities and in their details (No. 3.2).
In both countries, a key requirement for the procurement documents is that they must contain all the information needed to make an appropriate offer.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not be subject to anti-competitive requirements.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the subject of the order sufficiently.
In Germany, construction services can be divided into lots in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
In its audits, the NKÚ found, in particular in the field of road construction, that the award of extensive services without lots or with very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction on only a few large companies.
Narrowing the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and risk price or other collusion.
Under the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities can, under certain conditions, agree in principle with the companies already contracted additional or amended services, which will prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective benchmarks for determining the type of award were mostly followed in both countries.
According to the regulations of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary primacy of the open procedure applies to EU-wide awards and public tenders, which are in line with the open procedure for national awards.
This will allow more companies to make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price agreements between bidders more difficult and leads to the most economic results.
In the case of construction projects, whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building authorities generally awarded construction services across Europe.
The true value of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
In Germany, cost databases are used to determine the cost of public works, in particular in construction.
These are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective tool (No. 4.2).
In the case of construction services to be awarded across Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published, which should strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to adjust to the planned contracts at an early stage.
The audited building authorities generally complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may have affected competition (No. 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of applicants invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be disclosed beforehand.
In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting authorities in both countries should, as often as possible, switch among the companies to be invited when selecting candidates.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed guidelines in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations did not take these requirements into account.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, it is in the interest of equal competition to ensure that companies interested in bidding receive the same information during the bidding phase.
A contact between these companies and with freelancers involved in the creation of the service description is to be avoided as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audited building authorities in Germany did not comply with these requirements in part (No. 4.5).
The opening up of the bids in both countries must take into account in particular the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency.
The requirements for labelling, documentation, custody and secrecy of the offers are intended to narrow the scope for manipulation and are particularly well defined in Germany.
The tests in both countries yielded few complaints (No. 4.6).
In both countries, the examination and evaluation of the offers are determined by guidelines for the organisation of construction and execution.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, tendering offices handed over offers for testing to third parties without first looking through the offers and sufficiently documenting any abnormalities.
The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition will be informed of the proposed contract before the award of the contract.
This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for a judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities not comply with the prescribed deadlines when issuing orders, or deviated from the bidders' offer in terms of content (No. 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible to the audited building authorities in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the procurement notices of some procedures.
Some of the deficiencies identified also reduced the anti-corruption function of the documentation.
The public authorities in both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
Foundations of EU public procurement law and corruption prevention
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the Procurement Coordination and Appeal Directives, which had to be transposed into national law by the 8 Member States.
The general tendering principles of the European Union are, in particular, that of competition, equal treatment and non-discrimination, as well as transparency.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive sets out specific rules for construction projects to be forgiven across the EU.
In order to do so, their expected order totals must reach or exceed the current amount of 5,000,000 euros.
The rules relate in particular to the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the adherence to deadlines, including the receipt of the offers, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualifications of the applicants and the Appeal Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of the applicants and bidders.
In the event of possible breaches of public procurement law, the companies concerned can have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.
Prevention of corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
In both countries, there is no legal definition of the concept of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for the private benefit,
This is usually caused by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hamper competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of the world's economic output.
In the European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of public contractors, anti-competitive agreements or unfair practices can call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the basic tasks of public authorities.
In doing so, they will have to review the structure and execution of their administrations in areas that are particularly vulnerable to corruption in order to take appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventative measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works services is generally regarded as a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Anti-corruption measures
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery, as well as prejudice and approval - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a guideline and recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the Federal Administration. In addition to the risk analysis, the following principles must be observed for the procurement sector: Priority of public tenders and open procedures, the principle of transparency and transparency, the fundamental separation of planning, awarding and settlement, precise and complete documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, other anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the public procurement rules.
For example, in 2011, the Federal Ministry responsible for awarding contracts in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically assisted control system.
The award data - such as the estimated costs and the amount of orders - as well as information on the freelancers involved will be collected across the board and evaluated for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders, as well as the prohibition of all discrimination, are the most important bases for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has set out anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on the fight against corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national public procurement law and related administrative provisions 14.
The new legislation essentially includes the following provisions: Lowering the thresholds for smaller contracts, requiring the contracting authority to notify the contracts beforehand, including naming the reasons for the tender, prohibiting the restriction of the number of bidders in non-open procedures, and thus abolishing the possibility of bidding through lottery procedures, introducing the obligation to publish the contract documents and all annexes, introducing the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Audit results on the different stages of the procurement process
Award documents
The tender documents must contain all the information the bidders need to make an appropriate offer.
In particular, the award documents must allow for an accurate calculation.
In doing so, the bidders must not be given risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The award documents consist in particular of the performance description and the terms of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that determine the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The requirements of EU law on procurement documents are in particular addressed to technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.
The performance description must be basically product-neutral.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the performance description is only permitted under strict conditions.
Avoiding anti-competitive requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the award documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation in the preparation of the offers and for manipulation in their valuation.
German and Czech public procurement rules
The same or similar regulations in both countries have transposed the EU's technical specifications requirements into national law.
The services are basically product-neutral without any factory specifications.
In the performance descriptions, the individual performances must normally be subdivided into performance units with specific quantities.
Prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per m ² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the performance descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services where it is not clear whether they are needed.
Compensation based on lump sums or on time expenditure should be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on unspecified specifications in the procurement documents.
The performance descriptions must allow bidders to create their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The tender will not be made public until the tender documents have been finalised.
Divergent rules
There is no obligation to tender for construction services in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public procurement offices can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are basically divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial) and / or by type or subject matter (unskilled).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the competition, to increase the number of potential suppliers and to make price agreements more difficult.
This type of award is generally considered the most economical.
In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be specified in the procurement documents, both in the EU-wide and in the national procedures.
The aim is to ensure that applicants are fully and conclusively aware of the criteria for evaluating their offers.
In Germany, the specification of valuation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only required in EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria must only be set out in an internal administrative award notice.
Procurement documents drawn up by authorised freelancers may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or reviewers in Germany in the construction and some road construction administrations.
This is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the client's knowledge of the contact with these freelancers.
This is also why freelancers are not allowed to send award documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person for the companies is the client alone.
There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services, which prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements), are almost always required for large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions allow, to a certain extent, the awarding of contracts to the already contracted company, without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to EU regulations and German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary benefits must not exceed half of the main order.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a closer limit of 20% applies to the award without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the already contracted company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is generally not possible under the regulations in Germany.
In determining the remuneration for the additional services, it should be based on the agreed prices and the basis of the price determination of the order already awarded.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, small amounts cannot be charged with additional supplementary services.
Key exam results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the performance descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also included product-related specifications - such as graffiti protection, joints or noise protection panels - without the need for them.
In some cases, performance requirements were described in such detail that only one product was eligible.
List of services by subdivision
The BRH has not found any breaches of the bid in any of the audited proceedings to advertise services in principle in a list of services subdivided by partial services.
Completeness of performance descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the tender documents were completed before the start of the tenders.
In some cases, the tender documents had to be corrected during the offer phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the performance directories contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.
A list of services for demolition work consisted of almost half of such needs.
Loose and scoring criteria
Many awards lacked the prescribed rationale for why the services, which were mostly advertised to the unskilled, were not further divided into partial ones.
There were no complaints about the criteria to be used in evaluating the offers.
References to freelance workers
A small part of the performance descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.
Their names were partly on the cover sheets or in attached plans or reports.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of tendering."
In particular, in the construction sector, the contracting authorities attributed the complaints raised mainly to the failures of the freelancers charged with creating the performance descriptions.
The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity to adequately monitor the performance descriptions.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering In the public procurement process for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the performance description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.
During the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and nature of the required services in the performance descriptions.
As performance units, it only indicated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.
Completeness of performance descriptions
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the performance descriptions were changed four times in the period from August to September 2009, as part of a non-open procedure.
As the scope of services had increased significantly and the technical requirements had changed.
Tendering documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, inadequate pre-construction tests and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services to be commissioned.
When building a large library building, the performance description of the interior design did not include product quality requirements.
As a result of these missing specifications, some subcontractors built overpriced and unreasonably high quality equipment.
Loose and suitability criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction activities into partial or partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring revealed that if selected parts were to be allocated separately, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible at a total cost of 620.3 million euros.
For example, in six different buildings alone, which were the subject of a single contract, 2.5 million euros (25%) could have been saved in the case of a separate award.
If the construction of 20 bridges were to be allocated separately, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.
When it came to the award of construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority set out very extensive reference requirements as suitability criteria.
In the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required bidders in an open process to demonstrate, among other things, at least three road construction projects carried out, each worth 28 million euros over the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, no more than nine providers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another part of a motorway included six separate construction projects, in which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least €480 million over the last three years as a criterion of suitability for the companies.
Two thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) came from commissions from a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 procurement procedures with an order volume of 528 million euros, only two or even just one bidder made an offer.
The NKÚ showed that a narrowing of the market potential could lead to significant cost increases.
Additional services
In the case of the construction of a car bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the statutory procedures to the award of additional services in two cases, nor did it enter into written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality requirements, submissions in the first case amounted to up to 63.7 million euros (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million euros (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the case of several university buildings, some services were not listed in the award documents, although their need for the award was already known.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original value of the contract laid down in national procurement law, the contracting authority conducted negotiations with the contracted companies without notice.
In the construction of a large courthouse, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiations without a tender.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the work by 2 million euros.
The unit prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings
Based on a sampling of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to 14.6 million euros.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros, according to an analysis of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Building and Construction.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take into account the EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and corruption prevention.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient determination of performance descriptions should enable bidders to calculate and create their offers in an appropriate manner.
Protect the client from additional services to be agreed upon afterwards and also reduce the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the procurement documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and opportunities for manipulation.
In the Czech Republic, there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
The requirements for describing performance have largely been met in both countries.
In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The existing bid for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKÚ, the awarding of extensive services without lots or with very large lots can result in restrictions on the supplier field to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow circle of suppliers and that smaller and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.
Also, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other collusion.
When awarding and remunerating additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches in both countries differ.
According to EU and German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded with public notice under certain conditions without procurement procedures.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20%, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiation process without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded,
As the scope of public contracts is often insufficiently determined.
If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Define the type of award and take into account the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the client determines the extent of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential candidates and bidders largely unrestricted, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by imposing non-public procurement procedures.
Europe-wide procurement procedures must be applied to construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
When choosing the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account, in particular, the European legal requirements for competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, construction services are generally to be awarded across Europe in accordance with open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of Europe-wide procurement and award works in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than 1,000,000 euros and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.
A single construction project must not be divided into individual measures without a compelling reason, or deliberately valued at too low a cost, in order to avoid the obligation to award construction services across Europe as a matter of principle.
As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in preventing corruption.
The detailed justification of the chosen type of award as well as the examination of the application obligation of the EU procurement rules are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU rules on procurement procedures and thresholds into national law.
Divergent rules
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equivalence of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the decision having to be doctored or substantiated, while other procedures are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure, or - in the case of national awards - the public tender procedure, in principle, takes precedence, as defined by budgetary and public procurement law and by the anti-corruption guidelines.
Other types of tendering - such as the non-open procedure or the limited tendering procedure - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finalised in the procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented in a comprehensible manner.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender is to ensure that competition is as unrestricted as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by specifying certain bidders and to make possible price agreements between bidders more difficult.
The principle of public tendering is a key element in preventing corruption in Germany.
The true value of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
Construction services in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases from public administrations and other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. Among other things, the databases contain cost indicators for building categories, use units, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost parameters, the expected order value of a planned project or construction work to be awarded can be determined.
In Germany, the corresponding cost databases for road construction have only been provided by a number of building authorities.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Procurement offices in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price surveys of comparable construction projects to determine the estimated cost of construction services.
On the contrary, in most cases, the cost investigations are based on estimates of the funding body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.
The relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials as part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The purpose of this database is to collect information on material expenditure and construction and construction works, as well as other cost-relevant data, in order to enable cost investigations and provisions of unit prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a collection of data for construction projects to improve cost control.
Which will serve as a benchmark for the price fixing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key exam results BRH
Choice of award procedure
The audited public procurement bodies wrote out the works largely in open procedures or in public tenders, following the budgetary and public procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal construction services in the construction sector were advertised publicly or in open procedures.
In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.
In the election of non-public tenders, there was a lack of detailed reasons why the tenders had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.
In a cross-sectional investigation, based on more than 16,000 tendering procedures, the BRH found that non-public tenders have significant competitive disadvantages over open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In construction, more than twice as many bids were submitted for public tenders as for limited tenders and almost three times as many bids as for hands-free tenders.
The investigation also found that, on average, bidding prices for limited tenders and hands-free tenders were 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Buildings and a National Audit Office confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public tenders.
As a result of its research into economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Building and Construction even found that there were twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
In the case of the construction projects, for which they had identified a projected total contract amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, the audited contracting authorities usually set out procurement plans in which they set out the construction services to be awarded in accordance with EU and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this meant that more than 80% of construction services were to be awarded across the EU.
It was impossible to see how the commitment to EU-wide contracts could be circumvented by overly low cost estimates.
However, partly as a result of incorrect calculations, the minimum proportion of EU procurement procedures actually fell.
During the construction process, a number of tendering offices improperly changed the terms of their tendering plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures was still being complied with.
For most of the construction measures audited, the proportion of EU-wide contracts was usually lower than foreseen under the procurement plan, according to the settlement results.
In some cases, tenders for construction projects above the EU threshold were in breach of the requirement to tender all 1,000,000 euros and more comprehensive individual lots in EU-wide procedures.
And instead, they chose national procedures.
NKÚ
Choice of award type
In the case of several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several subcontracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
Through these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in defiance of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated value of the order
In road construction, the existing price databases in this area were only an insufficient tool to determine the expected order values.
The data were based on construction projects that had just been completed, but where there was evidence of a lack of profitability, unnecessary additional performance or excessive profits by the contracted companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% below the expected order values determined by the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the supply prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In construction, the expected order values were based on cost estimates estimated by the project architects or on estimates by investors.
Actual order values deviated sharply from estimates.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the value of the contract agreed later, but eight submissions in the course of construction led to a cost increase of 2.1 million euros, or 27%.
Similarly, the actual order value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
In the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%. In the construction of a judicial building, the costs increased disproportionately by 139%, as the area of use had only expanded by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed the EU rules for determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold into national law, which is why the respective regulations are broadly in line.
However, the primacy of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public procurement procedures or public tenders.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and the most economical results.
The risk of corruption will be significantly improved by not restricting the field of application by manipulation-prone stipulations of the client and by making price agreements between the bidders more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the advantages of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender in Germany.
Under Czech legislation, the contracting authorities can award contracts in open or non-open procedures.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in proceedings involving previous competition.
This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender procedure. In the Czech Republic, some services have been inadvertently distributed in order to avoid the requirements for the choice of the type of award.
When considering the EU threshold, errors had to be found in Germany, which resulted in a fall in the minimum proportion of services advertised across the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the expected cost of construction services and construction projects.
The building authorities should, if necessary, ensure through further checks that the requirements for the choice of the type of contract and the scope of services to be advertised across the EU are met or that the prerequisites for accurate cost investigations are created.
Advance information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded across Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies of the planned contracts in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The preliminary information is intended to contain the essential public procurement information on the planned construction projects.
They are required for those construction projects where the estimated total value of the contract reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the supply periods of open or unopen procedures.
In announcements, the client must provide details of the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of performance, the process and execution dates, the special requirements and the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the object of the order, the vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes), which is standardised throughout Europe, must be used.
Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the client.
In order to prevent the disadvantage of foreign interested parties, notices at national level must not contain any additional information and must not be published until after sending the notice to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may affect competition and may even support manipulation.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU's pre-information and disclosure requirements into national law.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published for construction services not to be awarded across Europe.
Procurement procedures may start at the earliest one month after the sending of advance information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide awards) or to the National Official Journal (for all awards).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of prior information be dispensed with.
In Germany, there is no need for prior information in the non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national tendering procedures, announcements for public tenders and contests must be published before limited tenders on the federal internet portal and, if necessary, in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of limited tenders without competition, announcements of services to be awarded starting from 25,000 euros are required (ex ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects must be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is particularly important because of the small size of the loose building contracts.
In the Czech Republic, the impact of this scheme is limited, as there are significantly fewer works being divided into lots.
Key exam results
BRH
Background information
The surveyed procurement offices published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded across Europe.
In some open cases, however, they shortened the offer periods, although the 52-day period required between the sending of the advance information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were tendered only after the 12-month period of prior information had already expired and before it was extended.
In the case of many published preliminary information, there was no indication of the planned division of construction services into lots.
Announcements
The notices of the audited bodies contained in part CPV codes, which deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not accurately record the required services.
In individual cases, announcements at national level were published earlier or contained more information - for example, on implementation deadlines - than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex ante transparency
The contracting offices of an audited building authority had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
The company published the messages on its own paid procurement platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had also forwarded the notifications to the federal internet portal, which is free of charge, as required.
Samples showed that only a third of the audited administration's reports were published on this portal.
NKÚ
Announcements
When building a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the bidders.
The contracting authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction on the number of bidders was permitted under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the contracting authority did not specify in the notice or in the documentation of the tendering procedure, according to which it would evaluate the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants it would allow to compete.
The award office concluded in its assessment that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicants with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The procedure of the award office was not transparent because it had not disclosed details of the qualification criteria and the evaluation process at any point in the process.
Publication of the notices
In the renovation of the former military site, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage information and communication system is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement for Europe-wide awards, strengthening competition and preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented EU rules and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public contracts
In contrast to public procurement procedures, in the case of non-public procurement procedures, not every company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded can participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority has to make a selection in advance of which companies should be invited to tender.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU rules allow for a limit on the number of applicants for EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies are required to submit bids.
At least three companies will be invited to negotiate with the tender notice.
In any case, the number of applicants invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be disclosed beforehand.
The selection of companies to be called upon is a process within the procurement process that is highly susceptible to manipulation, for example by allowing certain companies to be unilaterally preferred.
In addition, restricting competition to a small number of companies also encourages potential collusion between candidates.
In both cases, the result can be significantly impaired at the expense of the client.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this process.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
The rules governing the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the award offices should change as often as possible among the companies to be asked for when selecting candidates.
Nor should competition be limited to companies based in certain regions.
The award offices have to justify the selection of candidates and document the process of the selection process in their award notices.
Divergent rules
In Germany, in the case of limited tenders, at least three candidates are required to submit bids, and in the case of hands-free tenders, several suitable candidates are required to submit bids.
Under the new Czech rules, with the exception of two special areas, it is inadmissible to limit the number of bidders in the case of non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the choice of companies must be based on the multi-eye principle.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public tendering process, the management level of the construction service or a contractor from the contracting authority will generally have to amend this proposal by removing, for example, a proposed company and / or adding a new company.
This is to prevent a single person from being able to finalise the circle of companies to participate in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow for far-reaching collusion among the parties involved.
The list of companies to be asked to do so must be kept confidential and not made available to the general public, even to freelancers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no corresponding regulations on the establishment and secrecy of candidate lists.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be called upon, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory loophole in Czech legislation.
Key exam results
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to bid for non-public contracts was met with a few exceptions.
An analysis of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures for construction services in the construction sector showed that the contracting authorities asked an average of 6.6 companies to submit bids for limited federal tenders in Germany and an average of 4.4 for hands-free contracts.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
In particular, in the case of trades with few providers, the award offices did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
In particular, they took into account companies already known to them and, in their view, tried and tested.
As a result, they said they would have to ensure the suitability of the companies to compete in non-public proceedings before the call for an offer was made.
The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction on regional bidders in the non-public tendering procedures, but a higher proportion of regional companies than in public tenders.
This was mainly attributable to the fact that, on average, the performance of non-public procurement procedures is significantly lower and therefore, for example, longer access routes are more important than public tenders.
More Eye Principle and Proposals for freelancers
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to allow an independent person to amend the proposed list of companies to be asked to do so.
In particular, they justified this with a lack of processing capacity, time pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies required to make the offer.
A number of samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the applicant lists and that these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
As a result, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves to the extent necessary from possible manipulation.
Confidential treatment of bidding lists
At a public procurement office, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of this service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the designated or authorised companies could have been passed on unauthorised and, for example, they could have colluded.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases justifications for the selection of candidates.
NKÚ
Selection of candidates
During the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders received no information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not specify how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of admitted companies.
The award committee then proceeded with a process to select the companies.
However, this approach, which was in principle acceptable at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eyed principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole power of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be asked to do so, the German regulations restrict such opportunities for abuse.
In the case of Czech regulations, in particular, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been poorly implemented and that the potential for manipulation in these cases has not been sufficiently reduced for abusive restrictions on the field of participants.
The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the shortcomings identified.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or the call for tender, the offer phase begins, in which the companies can make offers on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.
Applicants can submit their offers by the end of the deadline set by the award office.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the procurement process.
The contracting authorities will have to comply with the national regulations aimed at countering the potential for manipulation during the supply phase.
These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
The procurement documents, on the basis of which the companies are to draw up their offers, are only to be sent by the contracting authority.
Freelancers involved in the award process are not allowed to carry out this task.
The contracting authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the tender phase.
In the event of ambiguities in the procurement documents or other questions relating to the tender process, only the contracting authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers charged with drawing up the award documents are not allowed to provide information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the contracted freelancers and the applicants must be avoided.
Freelance workers must not become a hub of the awarding process, through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
Offers sent by post or directly must be submitted in a closed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers have technical encryption.
Divergent rules
In Germany, the contracting authority can also order external service companies to print and send the procurement documents, whose employees are required to keep the offers secret and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
The offers received must be marked with an entrance stamp in Germany and sent directly, immediately and unopened to an officer responsible for the custody.
This employee must not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be kept under wraps until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority records the offer data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt data in a protocol.
The custody of the offers is not specified in the Czech Republic.
Key exam results
BRH
The bidding phase tests focused primarily on the procurement procedures of a building management company.
Dispatch of procurement documents
The contracting offices of the audited building management sent the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelance workers did not send procurement documents.
Information to applicants
The audited building management mostly failed to comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and awarding when naming the contact persons for inquiries and information.
Contrary to the specifications, in the performance descriptions, she did not specify employees from the contracting office, but from the project management as contact persons.
Some procurement documents even included the names of freelancers who had created the performance descriptions.
In individual cases, not all applicants received the same information when making enquiries during the offer phase.
Labelling of offers
At the audited building management, all offers received were marked with an entrance stamp and an entrance note.
In some hands-free contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the preconditions for preventing corruption.
Keeping the offers
After their identification, not all offers were immediately and immediately sent to the custody officer, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, the offers were placed in an open compartment of the post office, to which each employee had access.
Another office had hung a mailbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, and some of the offers that had been submitted there remained overnight.
Since the throw-in slot of this mailbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the office would have had the opportunity to take out offers received and, if necessary, to manipulate them.
NKÚ
On the Czech side, no defects were reported.
Summary findings
During the bidding phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process are to be avoided in both countries.
By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should also be respected.
The rules governing the receipt, custody and secrecy of the offers appear appropriate to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed breaches of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be eliminated with little effort.
Opening of bids
Opening of bids
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and made known.
From the opening date, the bidders will be bound by their bids until the deadline set by the award office expires.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU rules governing the opening of bids.
However, for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement process, the national anti-corruption rules contain extensive provisions to protect bids and competition.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the opening of the offer are intended to prevent manipulation and changes to the submitted offers.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be determined by the award office.
The multi-eye principle is designed to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers uncontrollably when opening up the offers.
In most procurement procedures, bidders can take part in the opening date.
Only offers which were submitted to the negotiator when the first offer was opened are allowed to open.
In principle, offers received late may no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the bid must be recorded in a protocol, including the names of the bidders and the offer prices.
The protocol is to be read out and signed by the negotiators.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, a committee is conducting the opening of the bids.
Freelance workers can also participate.
The committee can also be tasked with further stages of the procurement process, such as the evaluation of bids.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary are conducting the opening of the offer.
The negotiator must be an employee of the tender body.
The negotiator and the secretary should not be involved in the processing of the procurement documents, as well as in the awarding and processing of contracts.
According to the German regulations, in addition to the offer prices, the minutes of the opening date also contain information about discounts and discounts as well as special features - such as damaged or delayed offers.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the applicant's signature authority are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to those directly responsible for processing them.
Czech regulations do not exist.
If a tender procedure in the Czech Republic involves only one offer, it must not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If there is only one offer, it has to be opened and then evaluated.
Key exam results
BRH
More Eye Principle
At the opening dates, the audited contracting authorities implemented the requirements for the multi-eye principle.
They carried out the opening dates with negotiators and secretaries, who were not charged with any other contracts.
However, in the case of hands-free contracts with a smaller scope of services, there were isolated cases where freelancers opened offers sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Protocol
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late bids were not registered, in some cases even signatures were missing.
Labelling of offers
The award offices examined in the cross-sectional review identified the offers in accordance with the specifications by perforating them with the date of the opening date.
Inadequate labelling has been found in the case of prolonged audits of some beneficiaries.
However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practices after the complaint by the BRH.
NKÚ
Offer deadline
In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was received only one month after the end of the offer period at the award office, but the award office accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The rules governing the opening of bids in both countries are broadly consistent, taking into account both the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency, which can significantly limit the risks of corruption and manipulation in the opening up of bids.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the precise documentation of the process as well as for the labelling, safe storage and confidentiality of the offers significantly restrict the possibility of manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, those responsible for opening up the offers are not allowed to carry out any other tasks related to the service to be awarded.
All in all, only a few complaints demonstrate the high acceptance of the requirements for opening up the offer.
Review and evaluation of offers
The client must examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
In doing so, he has to determine the offer for the award of the award, which best meets the requirements according to the award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The EU's guidelines provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders has to be determined.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Companies that are legally convicted of bribery or fraud, for example, must be excluded from participating in the award procedure.
The bids of the non-excluded bidders must be examined in a computational, technical and economic manner and evaluated on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer, and the client has to examine offers with unusually low prices in particular.
The examination and evaluation of the offers is a particularly susceptible phase of the tendering process.
For example, bidders can be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.
By favouring or discriminating against bidders, the value result can be inadvertently impaired and thus prevented from finding the most economically advantageous offer.
The contracting authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons responsible for the audit and evaluation meet the requirements for integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions taken.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
In line with EU requirements, bids in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the suitability of the companies to be presented, as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the assessment and their weighting, are set out in the notices or in the award documents and cannot be changed during the process.
After checking the bidding appropriation, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used when evaluating the bids.
The rating must be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted offers must first be formally examined immediately as to whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities that could indicate possible manipulation intentions.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.
If the valuation of the offers results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions taken in the examination and evaluation of the offers are to be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Divergent rules
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to those directly responsible for processing them.
The review of the offers and the computational examination of the offers may only be carried out by the contracting authority.
It only has to employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not specified.
If freelancers are entrusted with the examination and evaluation, they have to treat the offers confidentially.
They can only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, award committees are to be set up to examine and evaluate the offers.
The committees produce valuation reports with award proposals.
In the end, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.
If the proof or explanation required to submit an offer in Germany is only incomplete, the contracting authority must give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the expiry of the deadline can the offer be excluded from the valuation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives the bidders the opportunity to complete a lack of evidence or explanation.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers have to be examined.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications that prices for partial services are too low or too high, the bidder must be asked to clear up these ambiguities.
If he fails to do so, and if the contracting authority can provide proof of a miscalculation of prices, this offer is excluded.
This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant increases in the cost of construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
Offers with unreasonably high or low prices may not be awarded in Germany.
If one or more offers fall short of the correct price determination of the client or the offer amounts of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders have to prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority can exclude the offers in question.
In the Czech Republic, the call for tenders can be rescinded after an audit of profitability, if only offers with unjustifiable prices are available at low prices.
In contrast to German public procurement law, for this reason, the contract cannot be refused for offers with prices significantly higher than the client's calculation.
If there is a suspicion of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its supervisory authority.
The Commission has to decide what measures to take and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.
The specialist supervisor at the top level, for example, also has to agree to more than 50,000 euros for construction work if the contract is to be awarded by hand, if a contract is not to be awarded for the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such regulations in the Czech Republic.
Key exam results
BRH
Suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the audited tendering procedures were in line with the requirements set out above.
In some of the companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A beneficiary contracted companies without the required proof of suitability.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the award office had taken into account all the award criteria made known in its selection decision or whether it had merely based its award decision on the "prize" criterion.
Selection of people involved and confidentiality of offers
Some contracting authorities used unauthorised persons to examine the offers.
For example, freelance workers or employees involved in the planning or execution of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be carried out by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, employees who were not required to keep the offers secret and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations were also involved in the examination of the offers.
In most cases, it was not clear to the construction services whether the offers were available to the freelance workers only to those directly responsible for the processing.
Review and audit of offers
A number of award offices handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination itself and having doctored their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.
In the documents examined, some of the abnormalities or lack of price or product information were not or only insufficiently marked.
Economic Impact Assessments
For a sample in a building administration, the cheapest offers for three-quarters of the audited tendering procedures deviated more than 10% from the previously estimated costs.
Every twentieth award procedure has been cancelled due to unreasonable offer prices.
Not all bidding tests and enlightenment discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, more detailed information was lacking, such as on the unit prices of the most important positions.
In many cases, the discrepancies were only justified on a blanket basis, for example by references to changed market prices or increased material costs.
The building services said that it was difficult to identify and prove mixed-use calculations.
In the case of a public service tender, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously estimated value of these services.
Further calculations or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a briefing, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then contracted company.
As a result, it remained unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client rated the contracted company as a "low-cost company" that could not maintain quality or deadlines.
In another call for tenders, a construction service awarded the contract to an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.
It did not lift the call for tenders, citing the non-factual reason that this company could be closed to a reasonable calculation.
Suspicion of irregularities
There have been two cases of irregularities in an audited building administration, both of which have been reported to the supervisor level.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders in a tender was identical, so that the contracting authority excluded both bids from the process.
When applying the other rules, the tests did not raise any significant objections.
NKÚ
Aptitude test
In many of the audited construction projects, including higher education, road construction and the expansion of the rail network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the process, even though they did not meet the requirements set out in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the required extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had met the requirements.
Rating
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take into account the given criteria for evaluating and evaluating the offers.
In the case of a construction project to expand the rail network, the award office did not determine the weighting of the evaluation criteria until the start of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the predetermined criterion of "shortening the construction phase" was misjudged in a procedure.
As a result, the shortening offered was not sufficiently taken into account by the second and third position bidders.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three tendering procedures within the framework of housing development, the contracting authority did not document the criteria it applied and on what basis it had selected the successful bidder.
In the construction of a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.
Tests of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The rules for testing and evaluating offers in both countries are in line with EU requirements.
However, with regard to the details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective regulations differ.
In Germany, the procedure is more regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eye principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the specifications, on the basis of which the adequacy of the offered prices must be examined.
In both countries, some of the audited tendering procedures found that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not or were not sufficiently documented.
Without traceability and transparency of audit and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are encouraged.
A particularly serious deficiency was the handing over of all offers to third parties, without the contracting authority having previously sufficiently reviewed and documented the offers and thus protected them from possible manipulation in further proceedings.
If contracting authorities are to carry out tasks in the examination and evaluation of the offers by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased amount of control are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the adequacy of the prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the set instruments and did not adequately examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose mainly in the aptitude test and in the application of the evaluation criteria.
Conclusion of the award procedure
After checking and evaluating the offers, the award procedure is completed by granting the contract or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the planned award decision.
The companies have the option to examine the intended award within 10 days, or for other means of communication within 15 days, in the event of information being provided electronically or by fax, and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder requests a review within the information period, the conclusion of the contract is only possible after the final decision in the review process.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.
The review procedure is designed to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the client to comply with the procurement law throughout the procurement process.
In order to do this, he must sufficiently document the procedure.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the contracting authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The client is to place the order within the announced deadline,
Also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and limited tenders, the client must not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.
The defeated bidders must be informed promptly of the award decision and the reasons for not taking their offers into account.
Tendering procedures may only be lifted under certain conditions, for example if the offer prices are excessive or the offers do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, there is a 10-day or 15-day obligation to provide information and to wait before awarding the contract, even for construction services not to be awarded across Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to EU-wide contracts.
In the case of the other proceedings in Germany, the bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure must be lifted if only one offer has been received or only one offer has been assessed.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable offer, provided that it complies with the terms of the tender and is economical.
Key exam results
BRH
In the case of the audited awards, there were only a few complaints at the conclusion of the award procedures.
In some cases, companies received letters of order for EU-wide contracts before the expiry of the information deadlines, which may lead to the ineffectiveness of the contract.
Also, according to open procedures, order letters contained content that deviated from the content of the offer in individual cases, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the clients did not comply with the award deadlines.
In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract for the second cheapest offer, as a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer willing to carry out the services at the originally offered price after the end of the contract period.
NKÚ
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content in the contract.
In some contracts, for example in the construction of road maintenance, the construction of a motorway and a bypass road, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the expiry of the legal deadline.
When awarding construction services for the redevelopment of the former military site, the contracting authority only forwarded the notification of the award to all bidders after the expiry of the legal deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements to complete the procurement process.
The legal protection of the defeated candidates or bidders will increase the tools for preventing corruption.
The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for placing orders have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
In the future, the building authorities should avoid the shortcomings identified when concluding their tendering procedures.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings and the reasons for the individual decisions.
In EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made public.
The order data is also recorded in an EU statistic.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency offer.
A carefully and promptly produced documentation makes it possible to trace the award decisions.
In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of bidders for contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to explain procurement decisions in detail significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
The notice of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be sent to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU, which also implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities also have to collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report it to the EU Commission through the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the European Commission draws up an annual EU statistics to provide an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU's documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are broadly the same in both countries.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts is not only limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is reduced to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to EU-wide contracts, there is a duty to publish only in the case of limited tenders and in the case of hands-free contracts with value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without VAT (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these value limits and in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure will receive information about the orders.
Key exam results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the audited procurement procedures were not fully documented.
The award notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.
In a procurement procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to a company, although its offer did not include mandatory proof.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the award procedure.
Announcements of orders
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to disclose the award of contracts.
In the case of further procurement procedures, there was no evidence that the contracting authorities had disclosed the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical records reviewed contained the minimum required information, which had been prepared and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited building authorities published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, due to a transmission error, this data was not published by a building management company.
The building management only noticed this error after half a year,
As a result, the order data of the procurement procedures that had been completed up to then were not published.
NKÚ
Documentation
In the case of construction work for the hosting of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed significant shortcomings, mainly due to incorrect information, such as incorrect offer prices in the minutes of the valuation commissions.
In addition, some of the protocols of the offer openings were not signed.
Announcements of orders
In the case of several road construction projects, announcements about contracts awarded were only delayed or not published at all.
Summary findings
The rules on documentation and reporting requirements are broadly consistent in both countries and are in line with EU requirements.
The transparency of the procurement procedures, including the award of contracts, is thus guaranteed in principle.
The regulations to be applied in the Czech Republic for publication go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The deficiencies identified in the documentation and in the notices significantly limited the anti-corruption effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The building authorities should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and orders and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
Parallel audits by the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two main areas that are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of construction services by public authorities: The application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law allow cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only designed to prevent or at least reduce corruption, but also to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit expertise of the two auditors on the application of public procurement rules in both countries, as well as the comparison of these rules, reveal similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in developing their procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
The EU's requirements for the award of construction services have been transposed into national law by both countries.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and in Germany, there is an important common basis for awarding construction services and taking into account the essential bids of competition, the equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.
The building authorities in both countries have in some cases been very supportive of these bids through further administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has also largely transferred the requirements for the construction services to be awarded across the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the auditors' investigations have shown that the building services have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The construction administration in Germany should continue to improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to resolve the complaints raised when implementing the EU requirements.
The tests in the Czech Republic have shown, in particular, dangers that affect the profitability of the contracts.
For example, incomplete performance descriptions necessitated additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation, and cost assessments were often inadequate, and excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and, in particular, restricted competition in the transport sector.
Prevention of corruption
The investigation did not aim to uncover cases of corruption,
Also because the auditors do not have the tools to do so.
However, the auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the awarding of works and how these requirements are applied.
Both countries have set different priorities for preventing corruption.
In particular, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition, as well as transparency and controls as key elements of the prevention of corruption.
The Czech regulations are mainly aimed at increasing the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which must be applied by the entire federal administration.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared towards their specific requirements.
In some cases, the relevant regulations set out very precisely how the bids to prevent corruption should be taken into account in the course of the award procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
According to the BRH, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is an appropriate tool to significantly reduce the risk of corruption in the awarding of construction services, while restrictions on competition increase the risk of manipulation.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the multi-eye principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures and various organisational measures are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore does not see any need for fundamental changes to the relevant requirements of the administrations in the award of construction services.
The rules for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some of the requirements.
The building authorities should continue to train their employees on the anti-corruption guidelines and make them even more aware of this issue.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks that the building authorities had delegated to freelance workers.
However, without controls and adequate safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Therefore, tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against unlawful interference.
NKÚ
The Czech Republic has adopted a strategy against corruption at government level, in which public procurement is the most important component.
The procurement law and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The NKÚ audits took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions are likely to be effective improvement measures, as the contracting authorities will have to justify the cost-effectiveness of the orders, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential assessment criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The NKÚ and the BRH are generally positive about the implementation of the EU guidelines.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's bids for competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.

In view of the enormous material and ideal potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the awarding of construction services, both auditors are calling on the building authorities in their countries to continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously investigated for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
In addition, a greater division of construction services into lots can have a favourable effect on supply prices, provided it achieves greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for efficient contracting by public authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised building services, whereas in the Czech Republic, these tasks - with the exception of transport projects - are carried out by the departments themselves or contractors appointed by them.
The auditors of both countries are anxious, even after the completion of their joint project, to develop the relevant findings and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings outlined are of general importance in order to effectively counter corruption and to ensure the economic award of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.

Football: Juve coach praises Ronaldo's best game after top scoring
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record-breaking 3-1 (1:1) victory against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the pricey star was the decisive man in the important match against the chaser, even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game around after falling behind early on by Dries Mertens (10th minute) and, for the time being, hanged off the worst chaser.
The goalscorer, brought in by Real Madrid, first set up former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26 / 49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner with a header, also did the groundwork to hit the head of defence Leonardo Bonucci (76), who had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to be even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
The best Juve goalscorer at the moment is Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three on his account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' dominance seems to be even more crushing.

But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.

Management of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Review report
Foreword
Taxes are the main source of income for public budgets.
A focus of the work of the auditors should therefore be on examining this area.
This applies in particular to VAT fraud.
This alone causes an estimated €100 billion in tax losses in the European Union every year.
Already at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn in 2005, the participants pointed out the need for enhanced cooperation.
This enables the auditors, for example, to exchange audit approaches and optimise audit practice.
VAT (VAT) is particularly suitable for cooperation as it is harmonised within the European Union.
In 2006, for the first time, the auditors of both countries examined the UST in parallel.
The corresponding audit report was published in 2008.
Since UST fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the courts of auditors is needed, which will allow for a comprehensive assessment of whether the measures taken are suitable to deal effectively with UST fraud.
The two auditors decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit. Management of VAT in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany report on the audit.
1. Introduction
Exam number: (CZ) 09 / 11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of examination: (CZ) Administration of the UST (D) Bilateral Audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (NKÚ), Audit
Audit target:
(CZ) The UST administration and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic (CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (Germany) should be reviewed, and the procedures used by the financial authorities in the field of mutual assistance should also be investigated.
(D) The audit should evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the auditors.
In addition, other test fields linked to the USt should be processed.
The findings made here should be compared to determine whether the tax procedures can be optimised.
The audit period was from 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period before the audit period until the conclusion of the audit.
2. Summary of the results and assessment of the parallel audit
The auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed to carry out an audit of the administration of the UST.
In the previous parallel investigation, they had uncovered suspicions of intra-Community transactions,
Which made a re-examination seem appropriate.
On the basis of the audit findings, the two auditors made recommendations on the management of the UST.
The aim of the review was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented and to examine the suspected cases identified.
The audit also looked at other issues, including selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of UST claims and the UST audit of large companies.
The Court of Auditors found that:
1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous audit
• Recommendation 1: The rules governing the registration of taxable persons should be harmonised within the EU
During the first audit, the auditors compared the registration procedures for VAT in the two states and found differences that caused problems.
The Court of Auditors therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxable persons within the EU.
This has also been taken up at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798 / 2003 provides for the extension of the current databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of those subject to VAT.
The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxable persons and their possible deletion.
The auditors expected the Member States to agree on appropriate arrangements to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the VAT system as early as possible, in line with their decision in principle.
On the final version of the draft, the Member States reached political agreement in Ecofin.
The aforementioned common rules are no longer included, and the two auditors regret that.
They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of the Summary Notices As a result of the first audit, the Court of Auditors recommended to the Member States that the Summary Notices (ZM) should be submitted on a monthly basis in the future.
The amounts of intra-Community turnover could then be reviewed more quickly.
Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common VAT system for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has reduced the deadline for the levy of the ZM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the USt Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.
In Germany, the implementation did not enter into force until 1 July 2010, which meant that it did not transpose the obligation to levy the ZM on a monthly basis into national law on time.
• Recommendation 3: Data matching of the UST pre-registrations and the ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the merger of the procedures for UST pre-registrations and ZM The German financial administration has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Audit Office and has set up a working group to work out possible solutions.
The work has not yet been completed.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor the further development.
• Recommendation 4: Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches to a risk management system at EU level In the course of the first audit, the two auditors agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria and elements or approaches to a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.
If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The auditors found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems, which have both strengths and weaknesses.
The NKU examined the information exchange system within the EU - Eurocanet, while the Federal Audit Office focused on German participation in the "Platform for Risk Management."
2. Verification of selected intra-Community transactions
At the first audit, the auditors jointly examined transactions in which it was doubtful whether they had actually been carried out or which had been explained differently by the taxable persons of the two states in the UST preliminary filings (or UST declarations) or ZM.
The auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for the inspection.
The audits by the tax offices of both states had not yet been completed at the conclusion of the first parallel audit.
The audit revealed that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed, and the respective financial administrations have taken appropriate measures to do so (including subsequent VAT provisions or the prevention of pre-tax refunds).
3. Review of selected, particularly risky intra-Community sales
The audit also included highly risky intra-EU transactions between taxable persons in the EU covered by the Eurocanet system.
Eurocanet is used to identify high-risk taxpayers.
Member States can participate in this system on a voluntary basis.
The CZ is an active participant in Eurocanet. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the exchange of data within the framework of Eurocanet.
From the point of view of an active participant state, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
As a result, no information could be obtained about which suppliers with German VAT ID would have been classified as highly risky cases.
The NKU identified both normal business incidents and those suspected of fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected sales.
This was particularly true for so-called "Missing Traders," where an audit of the documents alone is hardly enough to prove fraud to the taxpayer.
Suspected carousel fraud in imports and exports
It is recommended that customs and tax authorities work more closely together in order to be able to track the proximity of goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final consumer.
Germany and a number of other countries have refused to take an active part in Eurocanet because they do not believe there is a sufficient legal basis.
The Federal Audit Office found that the German financial administration uses other tools to identify high-risk taxpayers.
However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.
The Council of the EU agreed on a draft regulation,
Created by EUROFISC.
The experience gained so far with Eurocanet should feed into the planned network for the fight against VAT fraud.
4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.
For this reason, requests for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are handled in the same way.
The Federal Audit Office and the NKU compared the statistics that both Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
These statistics contained inconsistencies.
The two auditors consider a renewed discussion on statistics at EU level to be useful in order to avoid future disagreements.
If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.
In addition, the statistics should include more information on the VAT.
An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat VAT fraud.
Both auditors believe that Member States with a low recovery rate should strive to achieve at least the average recovery rate.
The Commission should support the Member States in this, if they so wish.
5. VAT audit at large companies
The auditors analysed the legal situation regarding the UST audit of large companies in both states.
In addition, they used a questionnaire to collect information from the financial authorities, which they considered important in this context.
It was clear that the situation in both countries is different.
For the selection of high-risk cases, the CZ has a system that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on VAT audits, balance sheet data, and profit and loss accounts).
As a result, the UST control can be effectively controlled and analysed.
In 2012, a special tax office for large companies will be set up.
There is no comparable system in Germany yet, which makes it difficult to control and analyse the overall UST control.
The German financial administration is focusing more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the UST pre-registration and / or UST declarations and the ZM.
Various risk management components, which are still to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.

3.2 Examination procedure in Germany
From February 2009 to February 2010, the audit area for traffic taxes and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich audited.
After selecting the examples, they announced the test in several countries:
• Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony. In addition, they conducted interviews in the Federal Ministry of Finance (Federal Ministry of Finance).
Tax records from the following subjects were included in the audit: • Erlangen, Central Tax Office Munich, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in the Upper Palatinate, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Special Tax Office Hamburg for large companies; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-Nordost, FA Essen for tax audits at large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd.
In addition, discussions were held with fä Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and the OFD Frankfurt / Main, Chemnitz and Münster.
The Federal Audit Office informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation between the two auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, the representatives of both auditors met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.
In December 2008, the presidents of both courts signed the agreement on cooperation in parallel auditing.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the exam teams were briefed on the initial results obtained during the preparation of the exam, discussed possible approaches to the examination and agreed on how to proceed.
A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.
The audit teams exchanged the exam knowledge gained up to that point and agreed on the timetable for the preparation of the joint audit report.
The two auditors set out the following topics for their parallel audit: • Evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • Review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxable persons from the CZ and from Germany, which could not be fully resolved during the first parallel audit; • Review of selected intra-Community transactions between taxable persons from the CZ and Germany classified as risky; • Examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of VAT receivables; • VAT audits for large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.
4. Audit of the management of VAT in selected areas
4.1 Implementation of the recommendations from the first joint audit
4.1.1 Implementation of Recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU Protected
In response to the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors has recommended that the requirements for VAT registration be adjusted and new rules for the deletion of registration in the CZ be introduced.
These amended rules should more effectively curb the risk of possible tax evasion.
In certain cases, it was found that the tax authorities did not delete the registration of taxable persons if they did not comply with their obligations under Czech law No. 235 / 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "VAT Act").
So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to require the fä to be erased if taxpayers repeatedly fail to submit VAT declarations.
According to the Czech VAT law, the FA can delete the registration of a taxable person from office if (a) the taxable person has not made any transactions for 12 consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for this; (b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT law; (c) the taxable person no longer fulfils the requirements for the tax obligation.
The first audit showed that the Prague 1 FA, due to the existing legal situation, would have to cancel the registration of "foreign taxable persons" 3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year if they were not required to register and pay VAT in the current calendar year.
The Prague 1 FA often did not delete the VAT registration of these taxable persons because the relevant provision of the time limit could not be adequately implemented in practice.
The problem was solved by the amendment to the US law, which came into force on 1 January 2009.
According to this, the FA has the power to delete the registration of a foreign taxable person if he has not provided taxable or tax-exempt goods or services in the previous calendar year and is entitled to a deduction.
Recommendation 2
Monthly levy of the ZM
On the basis of the initial audit, the auditors recommended that the monthly levy of ZM be introduced.
The Council Directive, which shortened the turnaround for the levy of the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the UST Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.
The ZM must now be delivered electronically.
In addition, a ZM must be issued if services whose place of performance is to be determined in accordance with Section 9 (1) of the VAT Act are provided to a person registered in another Member State as subject to VAT.
The condition is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the VAT for these services, as required by Council Directive 2008 / 8 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the place of service.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the UST pre-registrations and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation referred to the German financial administration.
In its ATIS4 system, the Czech financial administration automatically compares data on intra-Community transactions from the UST declarations and the ZM.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
The proper collection of the VAT is an essential prerequisite for the proper functioning of the EU's internal market.
That is why the fight against VAT fraud is of paramount interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by an investigation published by the European Commission in October 2009.
In this report, an external expert estimated the loss of VAT for the 25 Member States in the period 2000 to 2006. After analysing the available data, the tax loss for the period mentioned was estimated at between 90 and 113 billion euros, based on the fact that the EU-25 lose an average of 12% of their turnover taxes each year.
The estimated tax loss for the CZ in 2006 was 18%.
The first audit found that a Member State alone cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS).
Successful criteria, components or approaches to an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.
In relation to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors has examined the system for the exchange of information within the EU (Eurocanet).
For this purpose, taxable intra-EU transactions carried out and recorded in Eurocanet were selected (see Chapter 4.3).
The EUROFISC network aims to optimise mutual assistance in tax matters and to combat fraud more effectively, and to improve cooperation between the competent authorities in order to detect fraud as early as possible.
Later, EUROFISC could be used as a tool to assess the risk potential for intra-Community sales.
Ecofin Council 6 approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.
Eurocanet, which was developed by the Belgian financial administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7, serves as a model for EUROFISC.
The purpose of the system is to detect risky sales and to identify entrepreneurs involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Implementation of the Recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report led to the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Harmonising the conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU
On the basis of a detailed questionnaire, the German financial administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxable persons.
The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.
The system itself is constantly being improved.
The data provided in the questionnaire will now be collected electronically and will later be available for research, which will form part of the risk management process when registering.
The Commission had made a proposal 8 to amend Regulation 1798 / 2003, which included common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
There was still a need for clarification and clarification from the Member States.
The Federal Audit Office had recommended that the Federal Ministry of Finance should not fall short of the standards already achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly levy of the ZM
On 8 April 2010, a law 9 transposing EU directives into national law was adopted.
It includes, among other things, provisions on the monthly levy of the ZM on intra-Community supplies.
And will enter into force on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the UST pre-registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the UST pre-registrations and the ZM
A joint federal / state working group has been set up,
Which has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of data from the UST pre-registrations and the ZM.
The concept is still being discussed with the countries.
In addition, this working group has been working on a concept for optimising the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level. Relevant information will be exchanged at EU level.
Germany participates in the risk management platform.
The European Commission supported the initiative and initiated the creation of a risk management platform within the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan by written procedure on 18 October 2006.
The members of the platform dealt with the following topics in 4 subgroups: • Risk management tools, • influencing the behaviour of taxpayers, • Evaluation, • Update of the Risk Management Guide.
New reports from the "Risk Management Instruments" and "Update of the Risk Management Guide" subgroups were published in early 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The question of the conditions for the UST registration and its deletion in different countries has been dealt with at EU level.
The draft amended Council Regulation 1798 / 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218 / 92 provides for the extension of current databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.
This proposal also includes common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
The issues of registration and deletion are, until further notice, reserved for the national legislation of the EU Member States.
There was still a need for clarification and clarification from the Member States.
The Federal Audit Office had advised the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall short of the standards already achieved.
The final version of the draft was approved by the Member States in Ecofin on 8 June 2010.
It no longer includes common rules for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The two auditors regret this, and they still believe that such regulations are important to prevent VAT fraud.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Monthly levy of the ZM
With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous review, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the ZM in order to allow for an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-Community turnover.
Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending RL 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of VAT for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the turnaround for the levy of the corresponding ZM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the USt Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.
Germany did not implement the commitment to the monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010 and thus did not meet the deadline, while the CZ complied with the EU's requirements.
Comparison of the data of the UST pre-registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the UST pre-registrations or the ZM.
The German financial administration has taken up the recommendations of the Federal Audit Office and has set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor the further development.
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
Germany and the CZ use different approaches to identify risky entrepreneurs.
The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the Eurocanet system in CZ (see Section 4.3).
The Federal Audit Office focused on German participation in the risk management platform.
4.2 Verification of selected intra-Community transactions
During the first audit, a joint investigation was carried out into transactions in which there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or whether there had been any discrepancies in the notifications of taxable persons in both Member States.
For the audit, the two auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany, where the tax audit by the threads of the Member State concerned had not yet been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.
1)
In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth €22,686 from a German taxpayer.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition in his UST statement, because the period referred to in the German tax code did not have a UST identification number, but only a tax number for intra-German transactions.
Through international assistance in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that, according to German VAT law, the supplier of intra-Community goods does not need a VAT identification number in order to be able to claim the tax exemption for intra-Community deliveries of goods.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors found that, according to an audit by the competent Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT declaration declaring the purchase of goods of the above value and at the same time claiming the same amount of deduction.
2)
In the fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer was reported to have purchased goods worth 12,561 euros from a German taxpayer.
However, he said he had not purchased the goods and therefore did not declare them in his UST statement.
The German financial administration, citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, refused to process the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of €15,000.
As the Czech FA was unable to obtain documents, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax fix remained in place.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA received two spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, according to which the German taxpayer had billed the delivery of the goods in question to a Slovak addressee.
The Czech taxpayer purchased the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and announced the acquisition in his regular VAT statement for the month of October 2004.
3)
In the fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer was reported to have purchased a car worth 48 500 euros from a German taxpayer.
However, he did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
In addition, he had not issued a UST statement since August 2004, which is why the FA set the UST at 0 CZK for the quarter in question.
On the basis of information provided from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the FA asked the taxable person in March 2007 to submit a subsequent tax return, which the taxable person failed to do.
The audit found that the FA had carried out further audits in this tax case in 2007, finding that the car in question had been sold by the taxpayer to a used car dealer in the CZ.
The Czech FA imposed a predisposition for the tax period in December 2004, setting additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.
The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings on the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator was appointed.
In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax debt is likely to be irrecoverable.
4)
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer was reported to have delivered new vehicles (passenger cars) totalling 198 167 euros to Germany.
In response to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, it was stated that a tax penalty case was pending against the German taxpayer in Germany.
The audit carried out by the Federal Court of Auditors found that after the proceedings had been concluded, there was evidence that the German taxpayer was involved in fraud.
The intra-Community acquisition of goods was subject to labour market taxation in the amount of 182 424 euros (for 2004) and 369 690 euros (for 2005).
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.
On the basis of information provided by the German financial administration, a VAT audit of the Czech taxpayer took place for the tax periods April, May and June 2005.
On the basis of the audit findings and information from the international exchange of information, the FA set an additional UST of 703 031 CZK for May 2005 and 726 551 CZK for June 2005.
5)
Czech taxpayer A is alleged to have purchased a machine with a total value of €58,000 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer was reported to have delivered a machine worth 88 027 euros to Czech taxpayer B, but B denied the purchase.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that B had purchased the machine from a German company with a branch in the CZ.
Czech taxpayer A did not specify the purchase of the goods from the aforementioned German taxpayer in its VAT statement.
The German FA's response to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 showed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine worth 58 000 euros, but had made a delivery within the CZ.
In the inspection, the Federal Audit Office found that the intra-community delivery of the machine was classified as domestic delivery after the completion of an audit and the exemption from VAT was subsequently failed.
6)
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer allegedly delivered goods worth €11,600 to a Czech taxpayer.
The goods were purchased and later sold in Germany, in 2005.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary UST statement, which incorrectly identified acquisitions from another Member State, including acquisitions in the above amount.
The Federal Audit Office found that after receiving a response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the German FA corrected the German taxpayer's UST statement and set an additional UST of 1,600 euros.
Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding US investment there, an investigation is under way.
The ZM of the German taxpayer has not yet been corrected, as in Germany only the taxable person who handed over the ZM can correct it.
7)
The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German financial administration in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the question of the purchase of a car worth 47 400 euros by a Czech taxpayer in February 2005.
After an audit for the 2005 tax period, the Czech FA determined the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at 0 CZK and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech taxpayer.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the registration of the Czech VAT payer had been deleted because he had failed to comply with his tax obligations.
The Czech FA had sent the documents to the Czech police.
The German taxpayer has not yet corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax ruling.
8)
According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxpayer supplied a Czech taxpayer with goods totalling €33 205, which he did not declare to be an intra-Community purchase.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the discrepancies.
For the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer made repeated subsequent statements.
However, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference in the amount of acquisitions in the amount of CZK 134 273 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, which was due to the fact that sales for individual quarters could not be accurately allocated, and accepted the UST statements made.
9)
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer delivered goods worth 46 854 euros to a Czech taxpayer.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the interstate exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the Czech FA reviewed the actual value of the delivery.
With the German answer to this question, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of 31 998 euros, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.
According to the results of the audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors, the Czech taxpayer, following repeated warnings from the FA in January 2007, submitted a subsequent VAT declaration for the tax period of July 2004.
With this declaration, the taxable person simultaneously asserted his right to a deduction, so his tax liability for the tax period in question remained unchanged.
The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures relating to the sales selected for the audit had been completed and that the financial administrations in the CZ and Germany had taken appropriate measures (including subsequent VAT provisions or the prevention of pre-tax refunds).
4.3 Examination of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions
4.3.1 Statements in the Czech Republic
Eurocanet can be an important source of information to identify taxable persons at risk in the Member State of acquisition.
In the CZ, the early-warning information obtained from Eurocanet will be reviewed by the relevant FA with the purchasers.
Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has included information on sales and taxable suppliers deemed to be at risk in the Eurocanet system.
Nine Czech taxpayers were selected for the audit,
Those entered into the Eurocanet by the financial administrations of other Member States either as suppliers or purchasers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
As the German financial administration did not participate in the exchange of data on Eurocanet, it was not possible to determine whether suppliers with German VAT identification numbers were classified as risky by the German financial administration.
The audit identified both normal business incidents and those suspected of carousel fraud or other fraud.
In the cases in question, they exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003,
For example:
• They found no suspicion of risky sales when examining the early warning information.
The taxable persons in question were constantly monitored because their data was stored in Eurocanet.
• They failed to prove breaches of the rules for calculating the tax base and the VAT on the basis of the accounting documents submitted, even though they found discrepancies in the transport and storage of the goods or revealed business relationships with mailbox companies from other Member States.
• The review of individual business incidents was complicated because certain taxable persons did not cooperate with and could not be contacted.
The relevant experts reviewed most of the risky taxable persons and transactions mentioned in Eurocanet's early warning notices.
However, their options for checking risky sales, especially so-called "missing traders," are limited.
In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly prove the fraudulent behaviour of the taxpayer.
Stricter requirements for the registration of taxable persons for the purposes of VAT and greater flexibility in the deletion of registrations would help to combat VAT fraud.
The taxable persons involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for the purposes of the VAT in order to deceive fictitious goods deliveries across the EU or to issue formally correct tax receipts to other taxable persons, with which they then claim unjustified claims for deduction.
In the case of suspected carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is recommended that customs and tax authorities work more closely together in order to be able to track the quality of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final consumer.
Member States can participate in Eurocanet on a voluntary basis.
The fact that three major Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not take part was seen by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by the establishment of a EUROFISC network with mandatory participation.
4.3.2 Statements in Germany
The Federal Audit Office evaluated data available at the Federal Central Tax Office, including those from Eurocanet.
They served as the basis for the selection of six German taxpayers whose files were reviewed.
Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to participate actively in Eurocanet.
That is why Germany has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of Eurocanet data.
This is justified by the fact that "from the point of view of the federal government.
No unquestionable legal basis [exists] that would allow the tax secrecy that exists in Germany to be broken.
In addition, the Federal Government does not have reliable information on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of Eurocanet."12 Since October 2007, the Federal Tax Office has been evaluating the Eurocanet data and communicating it to the federal and state financial authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.
The German companies will receive control notices on the direct business relationships of the taxable persons registered with them in Eurocanet with companies from other EU countries.
However, the German FA does not receive any information on whether the company from the aforementioned other EU Member State has business relations with a company based in another Member State, which is also in business with the German company from the control notice.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The CZ is an active participant in Eurocanet, while Germany has only a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
Accordingly, the test had to be carried out differently in this area.
However, it has not been possible to identify significant differences in the success of the detection of VAT fraud, which is due to the fact that Eurocanet is only one component of the risk management system.
The financial administrations of both countries, however, have a variety of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, although it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft Regulation 13, which created EUROFISC, a network for combating VAT fraud.
The experience so far with Eurocanet should be shared by the Member States at European level and incorporated into this network.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that there is a need for discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for exempting intra-Community transactions.
4.4 Mutual support for recovery of claims
4.4.1 Interstate assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
The legislation on mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:
Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and duties;
Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC amending Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures that form part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as on levies and duties and on VAT and certain excise duties; and
Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC laying down detailed rules for the implementation of certain articles of Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
The CZ implemented Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC by Law No 252 / 2000 on mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims.
After the adoption of Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC, it also had to be transposed into Czech law, and at the same time it was necessary to amend the aforementioned law.
In this context, Amendment No 191 / 2004 on mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.
A new key piece of legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179 / 2008 of 28 November 2008.
The annexes to this regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009, and the regulation also makes electronic transmission mandatory and requires the requesting authority to certify that all documents sent are in accordance with the original.
Key principles of international mutual assistance for the recovery of claims are:
1. The principle of reciprocity applies;
2. Assistance must always be provided on request and in compliance with all conditions;
3. Mutual assistance does not cover claims that are considered a criminal sanction in the requested State;
4. The procedure for mutual assistance in the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;
5. In the recovery process, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;
6. Mutual assistance will only be provided for the recovery of undisputed claims;
7. The principle of utilisation applies: The requesting state must use all the means it has under national law to recover the claim.
Law No 191 / 2004 provides for three forms of mutual assistance: The provision of information, the delivery of legal acts and the actual recovery.
Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU Member States
The competent FA has to send the request for information, the request for the delivery of legal acts or the request for recovery, together with the relevant documents, electronically to the CZ Ministry of Finance via the respective finance directorate.
The Ministry of Finance of the CZ is responsible for translating the request into the relevant language, scanning it with all the equipment and sending it via the communication network or the common interface CCN / CSI to the competent financial authority of the State concerned.
A request for aid must meet the following requirement: The claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.
The requested authority can refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.
Procedures for incoming requests from other Member States
The receipt of requests from other Member States must be confirmed by the Ministry of Finance of the CZ as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.
If it decides not to grant the request, it must notify the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, citing the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.
The notification must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the request.
After receiving the request, the Treasury Department will examine whether the request meets all legal requirements.
The FA will then send the request to the relevant FA via the relevant Financial Directorate. If the recovery request is accepted, the FA will have to determine, among other things, the debtor's financial situation, for example by extracting from the Land Registry, finding out about existing bank accounts and registering motor vehicles with the registration office.
After six months from the date of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance will inform the CZ of the outcome of the investigation.
The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxable persons concerned are not reachable and the claim cannot therefore be recovered.
All sums successfully contributed must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.
The Czech FA, which deals with the recovery, can agree to the demand for hours or instalments with the consent of the requesting state.
The interest or surcharges imposed on the debtor for the period of delay pursuant to Law No 337 / 1992 on the management of taxes and fees
Stand by the requesting state.
In 2006 and 2007, in particular, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ delayed sending the relevant FA requests for recovery.
The same was true for the forwarding to the competent authority in the requested state of the recovery requests made by the Czech authorities.
The audit found that the Ministry of Finance had breached the law on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims and had failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of the receipt of the request.
The situation has improved since 2008.

In accordance with Section 13 (4) of Law 191 / 2004, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall prepare a statistic for the European Commission by 15 March of each year, which includes the number of requests submitted in the previous year, as well as requests for information, notification of legal acts and recovery, including the amount of the respective claims.
Based on the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission is preparing its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.
The audit found that in 2008, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ declared the claims to be too low by EUR 5 250 000, due to the incorrect indication of the amount of a US claim made in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal point in the conversion of Czech crowns into euros).
The error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.
Information on mutual assistance is given in the table below.
4.4.2 Interstate assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal basis for mutual assistance in tax matters is the Community legal standards Council Directive 2008 / 55 / EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Directive on recovery) 14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178 / 2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).
In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC recovery directive codified Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended several times.
It covers, among other things, the recovery of VAT and taxes on income and assets, including the associated interest, fees and surcharges.
The EC recovery directive was transposed into German law by the Beitreibungsgesetz (EC) 17 of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is regulated by the Tax Code (AO).
§ 117 (2) AO stipulates that the financial authorities can provide interstate legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal standards of the European Communities applicable in national law, as well as by virtue of the EC Official Assistance Act.
Part Six of the AO (§ § 249-346) contains the legislation for the enforcement procedure.
The administrative actions of the financial authorities are governed in particular by the enforcement and enforcement instructions.
The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters with the representatives of the supreme financial authorities of the countries and transferred its own competence in this area to the Federal Central Office for Taxation 18.
The general conditions for the admissibility of a request for state aid are:
• The legal requirements must be met (§ § 251, 254 AO).
• All domestic recovery funds have been exhausted.
• The claims for which assistance is requested for recovery are incontestable.
• The period between the issuance of the enforcement title or the date on which the claim or title became incontestable and the date of the request must not exceed five years.
• The claim must be at least 1,500 euros.
Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU member states The German requests for the recovery of backward taxes are forwarded by the enforcement bodies of the fä via the competent central authority and the Federal Central Office for Taxation to the relevant foreign authority, such as the Czech Clo.
The details are set out in the Official Journal of State Assistance to Tax Survey (recovery) of 19 January 200419.
This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal / state working group and adapted to the new recovery directive.
The request, along with equipment, will be forwarded electronically by the FA to the central authority.
The latter examines whether it is correct in terms of content and form.
If not, the request will be returned to the FA in question.
Otherwise, it will be forwarded to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Central Tax Office will then take over the necessary communication with the relevant foreign authority.
Procedures for incoming requests from other EU Member States
Requests for contributions from other Member States will be recorded in the Federal Central Tax Office, which will send a confirmation of receipt within ten days.
It also examines whether the formal requirements are met.
The Federal Central Tax Office generally passes these requests on to the central authority, which directs them to the relevant FA and supervises the execution.
The Federal Central Tax Office also sends interim and final reports.
If the processing of a request takes longer than six months, it reminds the central authority of the obligation to submit an interim report pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC.
After examining the formal and factual conditions for the admissibility of the request, the enforcement authorities announce relevant measures.
All contributions must be transferred to the bank account specified in the request within one month of receipt.
Statistical data
Information on mutual aid between Germany and the CZ for the years 2006 to 2008 (as of 31 December 2008).
4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases
A total of 21 intergovernmental requests for recovery between the CZ and Germany have been selected for the audit, with ten cases listed below, including:
The following was found:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for the recovery of the debt of a Czech taxpayer from 2004 and 2005 totalling 3 883 euros (109 820 CZK).
It was not until 26 February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the relevant FA.
In order to secure the claim, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxpayer with a basic lien.
As the contaminated property was not sufficient to pay off the entire tax debt, the debtor was granted a rate payment agreement of at least CZK 2 000 per month.
On 31 August 2009, an interim report was sent to the German FA, according to which the taxpayer had in the meantime paid tax debts amounting to CZK 49 600 (as of 25 August 2009).
The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly afterwards, on 28 August 2009, a further 3,000 CZK were transferred.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for tax debt (VAT, income tax) as well as interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer totalling 180 869 euros (= 4 434 915 CZK).
It was not until 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the relevant FA.
After reviewing bank balances, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable assets, the FA found that the debtor did not have any tangible assets.
Local investigations also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.
His whereabouts in the CZ were unknown.
This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and forwarded to the German Finance Administration on 16 April 2009.
3.
On November 21, 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for payment of UST, along with interest and fees totalling 3 139 euros (= 84 846 CZK).
It was only on 6 August 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech tax debtor had now settled the debt.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case was closed because the Czech tax debtor had fully settled his debt in Germany.
However, the debt was also settled in the CZ as part of the recovery process and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Because of the long time it took the Czech Ministry of Finance to pass on the information to the FA, the tax debt was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the competent Czech FA.
In cooperation with the Federal Audit Office, it was determined that the amount contributed would be offset with the tax debt from another procedure, which amounted to 6 649 euros and was due to be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.
According to the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance, the company in question only received a recovery request of 3 139 euros, which did not include a recovery request of 6 649 euros.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for income tax, VAT, interest and fees totalling 39 957 euros = 956 654 CZK.
It was only on 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the relevant FA.
The recovery procedure was launched on 1 June 2009 and a decision was taken to seize the Czech bank balance and the debtor's salary (CZK 7 000).
During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the amount of the tax debt and the amount was disputed.
According to the Czech FA, the debtor had been willing to pay 250 euros a month in the past, but the German FA in charge did not agree.
The taxpayer pledged to discuss the matter with the German FA in order to agree on a different amount.
The recovery procedure was not yet complete at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for contributions for income tax in 2005 as well as VAT for the years 2003 to 2007, along with interest and fees totalling 113 444 euros = 3 116 304 CZK.
It was only on 14 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the Prague 1 FA, which is not authorised to handle tax cases of taxable persons resident in the CZ; on the basis of the available address, a local FA could not be determined.
In its investigation, the FA received information and documents on 19 September 2008 stating that the debtor's income amounted to €4,704, but it was unable to issue an enforcement order because the recovery request was received after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order to seize the debtor's assets from credit institutions.
The recovery procedure was not yet complete at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
6.
On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA asked for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of a UST debt, along with procedural costs totalling 146 223 742 CZK.
It was not until 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
On 8 September 2008, the German FA, through the Bundesbank, transferred to the Czech authorities the amount of 17,700 Euro = 439 226 CZK, which was contributed by account attachment.
A conversion error was discovered when checking the amounts contributed.
The payable amount of 146 223 742 CZK was converted to the exchange rate of 1 Euro = 25,065 CZK, but a comma error resulted in an amount of 583 378 Euro.
The correct amount of the contribution amounted to 5 833 782 euros.
As a result, a request for recovery, which was reduced by EUR 5 250 404, was made.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA asked for the recovery of a UST debt, along with interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer totalling 1 970 632 CZK = 79 847 euros.
It was not until 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
The German FA asked the debtor to pay the arrears on 4 February 2009.
Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008, and in particular in the first half of 2009, as well as the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax debt: On 8 April 2009 - 4 600 euros, on 6 May 2009 - 3 000 euros and on 16 June 2009 - 2 500 euros.
These payments were transferred to the account of the competent FA in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, a further payment of €2,500 was agreed between the debtor and the FA until 30 June 2009.
8.
On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA asked for the recovery of tax debts totalling 398 653 euros = 9 832 779 CZK, which included, among other things, a basic advertising tax.
It was not until 2 October 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
In a letter from the German Finance Administration to the Czech Ministry of Finance dated 3 April 2009, the request was returned.
The German financial administration justified this by saying that the basic advertising tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC.
In addition, Article 2 (g) relates to liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.
Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC applies to taxes on income and assets not mentioned in Articles 1, 3 and 4 of Directive 77 / 799 / EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new request for contributions to the German financial administration, which should no longer include the basic income tax arrears of CZK 61 759, but the arrears in the VAT, corporation tax and income tax.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxpayer amounting to CZK 7 079 735.
9.
On 6 February 2006, the competent Czech FA submitted to the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for income tax and VAT totalling 3 445 782 CZK = 123 328 Euro.
The UST debt was 1 133 967 CZK.
It was not until 18 April 2007 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
And it was only on 11 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the Czech FA the reply from the German Finance Administration on 9 July 2007,
After the German FA issued an enforcement order on 11 June 2007 to seize the bank account, the bank announced that it was not in business with the aforementioned taxable person.
As a result, the request for German financial management was deemed to have been settled.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA submitted to the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for US debt totalling 1 296 845 CZK = 43 591 euros.
The responsible Finance Directorate submitted the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German Finance Administration on 15 December 2005.
Before submitting the request, the Czech FA carried out the tax requirement by confiscating the accounts of banks and the payment of salaries, as well as by charging a property.
A request for information was sent to the German financial administration on 16 March 2005, before the request for a recovery.
According to a letter of reply sent to the Czech FA on 16 September 2005, the Czech taxpayer was domiciled in Germany and had income from non-self-employed activities amounting to 8 437 euros. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a response to the request for a contribution and only forwarded it to the relevant Czech FA on 12 February 2008.
According to this, the tax debt in Germany is unrecoverable due to the debtor's insolvency.
No assets were found, and the income from non-self-employed activities was already subject to other enforcement measures.
The German financial administration considered the request to be settled.
4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation
In the case of recovery, the requirements of EU law apply to all EU Member States for mutual assistance.
The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.
The Federal Audit Office and NKÚ have compared the statistics that the two Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
There were disagreements.
In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States draw up their statistics with greater care.
In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite a greater number of requests for assistance, the discrepancies in the statistics have decreased.
Both auditors believe that a renewed discussion at EU level on the statistics makes sense, so that the remaining disagreements can be avoided in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics are partly meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.
In addition, the Court of Auditors considers that the statistics should indicate both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amount of amounts contributed per Member State.
By analysing more closely the statistics provided by the Member States, the Commission could help Member States assess their measures to combat VAT fraud.
Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the auditors argue that Member States with low rates should at least aim for the average recovery rate within the EU.
At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.
The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance (CZ) have been delayed, particularly in 2006 and 2007, and have been forwarded to the relevant departments.
The same applies to the recovery requests made by the Czech authorities.
The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance was in breach of the law No 191 / 2004 on interstate aid when it failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of the recovery measures within the six-month period from the receipt of the request.
4.5 Value Added Tax Examination for Large Businesses
4.5.1 VAT audit for large companies in the Czech Republic
Background
The tax procedure for large companies is subject to the same rules that apply to other taxable persons.
The audit of large companies is regulated by Czech Law No. 337 / 1992, the "Tax and Fees Administration Act."
The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large companies as natural persons who have established a business or legal entities established to operate a business and whose net turnover for the tax period in question is at least CZK 2 billion, according to income and corporate tax returns.
The taxable person is classified as a large company based on the amount of turnover according to income or corporate tax returns in the respective tax period; for the first time in 2003.
A natural or legal entity will no longer be run as a large company for the purposes of revenue taxation if, in three consecutive periods of investment, its net turnover in the tax period is less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins with the expiry of the tax period, for which the conditions were met for the first time according to the tax return.
A taxable person can only be removed from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been examined beforehand for a tax period.
By the end of 2009, all major companies were audited at least every five years.
Since 2010, taxpayers have to be assessed in writing at least every two years, and the subsequent control measures are designed to eliminate the tax risks and their negative impact on the proper tax setting and collection.
The audits by the fä should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually cover several tax periods.
The large taxable companies have been audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the relevant departments, which have been set up for a total of 13 years.
A special audit body carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the guidance of the head of the finance directorate.
In addition, she also checked.
Taxable persons with unusual and special business activities; and
Those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time.
Tax payers with complex location distribution and organisational structure will also be examined;
Taxable persons suspected of large-scale tax evasion
As well as taxable persons belonging to chains and networks suspected of extensive tax evasion and unjustified deduction.
Information on the number of audits carried out by the special audit bodies of the fä and the additional tax results of these audits are given in Table 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No 531 / 1990 for the regional financial authorities, in particular proposing the establishment of a special tax office with national jurisdiction for selected taxable persons (legal entities established for the purpose of economic activity, with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion).
4.5.2 VAT audit for large companies in Germany
Background
The audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. General regulations apply to audits • the tax code (AO), • the financial management law (FVG) and • the audit code (BPO).
There are also work aids.
Tax code
The provisions of Sections 193 to 203 of the AO "Section 4 external audit" contain, in particular, rules for the admissibility of an external audit and its factual scope, distribution of responsibilities, the form and content of the audit announcement, the principles of examination, the duty of the taxpayer to cooperate and the conditions for final discussions and for the transmission of the audit report.
External examinations will be carried out by the competent fä (§ 195 AO).
According to § 5 (1) (1) in conjunction with § 19, it is the responsibility of the Federal Central Office for Taxation to participate in external audits of the fä.
The nature and extent of this participation will be agreed between the authorities involved.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office may require that certain companies it has designated be audited at a certain time.
In this case, it can lay down rules for the external audit of these taxpayers.
In accordance with Article 108 (7) of the GG, the Audit Regulations (BPO 2000) were adopted with the approval of the Federal Council.
It applies to external audits by the state financial authorities and the Federal Central Office for Taxation.
According to § 3 BPO, companies are regularly classified in size classes.
Large companies have to undergo a follow-up inspection (item 4.2 BPO).
In accordance with section 33.1 of the BPO, each competent financial authority has to keep a list of companies within the meaning of the regulation.
Administrative assistance
In addition, the following work aids have been issued for the administration:
• "Single Handbook for the UST Special Examination";
• Value Added Tax Countries Online - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community VAT control procedure) with guidance on how to use the data contained in the MIAS on intra-Community business relations;
• Work aids for difficult and special situations.
• Central database for the storage and evaluation of VAT fraud cases and the development of risk profiles;
Taxable persons are classified in size classes based on criteria such as turnover and profit, with limits varying depending on the business sector.
The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
The values are reviewed every three years and set for the following three years.
The number of companies - not just large ones - is regularly recorded (last deadline: 1 January 2010).
In general, large companies must be fully audited.
The audits will be announced and usually extend to the US,
In other words, the audit covers all relevant taxes, including income tax, corporation tax, business tax and VAT.
The sales tax can be audited by either auditors or special auditors.
The practice is different and depends on the administrative structure of the individual countries.
The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.
The BPO 2000 will run for three years.
The audit is subject to all taxes that a company has been asked to pay.
4.5.3 Management of the VAT audit for large companies
Under the terms of the agreement, both auditors did not examine individual cases, and they looked into how the financial administrations handled the audit of large companies.
With the help of a questionnaire, they collected information from the financial authorities, which is essential for the audit of large companies.
• Which statistical records and evaluations for the audit of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?
In particular:
• Are there any statistics or records on the extent to which a distinction is made between the fight against fraud and the general audit?
CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.
Germany: The financial administration does not distinguish between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.
• Are there any statistics or records about the time of the exams?
CZ: Information on the timeframe of audits of intra-Community acquisitions of selected USTs is recorded in the ATIS system;
The same applies to information on the start and end of the FA's audit.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors compiled at the federal level only contain information about the so-called average last audit period (year).
This figure does not give an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.
UST special auditors focus on the last USt investment periods and are also authorised to audit large companies.
The federal statistics for UST special auditors do not include information on the size of the audited operation.
• There are statistics or records of the type of increase; for example, divided by:
I. Real surplus (e.g. application of a reduced rate instead of the general VAT rate)
II. Incorrect additional income (e.g. relocation / postponement of a situation which cannot be objected to under the sales tax law into another tax period)
III. Cash effectiveness (payment of the fixed additional income)
CZ:
The Czech financial administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of the additional tax result broken down by type of tax, the number of taxable persons audited and the number of tax periods audited.
Other tax procedures (on-the-spot investigations, reminders) will be monitored in the same way.
Regardless, the amount of repayments and incoming payments will be recorded.
Statistics on tax liabilities are broken down by type of tax, but there is no distinction between tax liabilities arising from a tax return and those arising from FA audits.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors and special auditors compiled at the federal level do not differ according to the above criteria.
Nor did most financial authorities, where local surveys were carried out, differentiate in this respect.
• Are fruitful test fields recorded?
CZ: Yes, the FA can select audit cases on the basis of criteria linked to selected indicators stored in the ATIS system.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and special auditors do not provide such information.
However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a common approach.
As a result, auditors and tax investigators in the countries will have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if they exceed a certain threshold.
In this case, additional information must be provided, such as the origin of the UST surplus result achieved.
• Which are the most common findings?
CZ:
- taxable large companies have unjustifiably taken advantage of the deduction for related supplies and services;
• which were not used for business activities in accordance with § 72 (1) CZ UStG;
• which were used for representation expenses in accordance with § 75 (3) CZ UStG;
• Because of invoices that do not meet the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG
- large taxable companies have failed to register the VAT to be paid in § 21 (1) CZ UStG.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and special auditors do not provide such information.
The countries do not separate findings on the VAT from audits of large companies.
However, the Federal Central Tax Office can evaluate the ZAUBER database, in which the auditors and tax investigators of the countries have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved in case of exceeding a certain threshold.
• Does the financial management analyse the results of the audit and draw conclusions for strategic management?
CZ: Yes, for example, nationwide checks are carried out on risky goods and industries.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and special auditors do not provide information on particularly "productive" audit fields.
With regard to the analysis of such information, the use and the way in which it is used, there were different views in the survey bodies.
Some senior finance directorates make such information available to them, but they are free to decide whether or not to use it.
4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation
As a result, it should be noted that large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ, including data from UST audits, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss accounts in the system.
The CZ is able to control the selection of high-risk cases on the basis of a wide range of information.
The same applies to the evaluation and management of UST exams in general.
In the CZ, the establishment of a special financial office for large companies is planned for 2012.
In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparable amounts of data.
Accordingly, it is more difficult to perform these tasks in the same way.
The focus is more on the selection of relevant individual cases.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
On the basis of the information provided in UST advance applications or UST declarations as well as test notices, qualified auditors select the cases to be examined and ensure the correct taxation.
Appropriate management processes and risk management systems need to be put in place in order to reduce revenue losses at the UST and, at the same time, increase the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs.

5. Conclusions
The cooperation between the two auditors has proved its worth.
In this way, it was possible to obtain the necessary knowledge about the systems used in both countries: In particular: • intra-Community sales, • risk management at the UST, in particular with regard to the selection of risky sales, • recovery of UST claims and • UST audit of large companies.
The audit revealed differences in the strategies for detecting VAT fraud and in the systems described above.
These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.
They can also be used to initiate a discussion among interested parties on which approaches and strategies to combat fraud can be used, such as the relationship within and between Member States and the EU Commission.
The experience and knowledge gained should encourage us to continue to jointly examine the administration of the UST.

From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and state care was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On 29 September 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last impulses for the founding of the district association for horticulture and state care Kulmbach were set, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
At the time, however, he was still called differently: As a "district sobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land," he was baptized by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - in fact, it was purely about fruit growing, about flowers and horticulture nobody thought about at the time.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained district nurse Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees were supposed to line highways, and so-called industrial gardens were set up in schools.
The cultivation of fruit is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7,000 members.

Chestnut collecting was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that smartphone & Co. can be used to collect a similar amount of joy.

"The district association decides where they should stand," added Councillor Söllner, stressing the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, the beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county also left county executive and expert adviser Friedhelm Haun in no doubt.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the county association with a lecture and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, and in the winter it was doused.
At the end of the 50s, however, the garden was transformed into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has endured, it was there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," said the expert in fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added the president of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl.

Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of VAT in the Czech Republic and Germany
Foreword
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the auditors have the power to audit the entire public finances.
The declaration requires that the auditors have the power to examine the tax collection as much as possible.
The Organization of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the Sixth EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the auditing of public revenues by the auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of an auditor is the development of a special strategy for auditing public revenue.
This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly interlinked and interdependent, there can be a situation in which national auditors can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the auditors of other states.
As an example, the audit of internationally organised fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many states.
Cooperation between the authorities is needed in the fight against such crimes.
Auditors in this area must be prepared to work closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of VAT and the MIAS system was developed at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn, which was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating auditors first had to familiarise themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
On the basis of the evaluation of the available information, we made the selection of the test subjects for the examination planning.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit will not only help to improve the work of financial management, but can also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of VAT in the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Case number: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of examination:
(CZ) Management of VAT after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(De) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
The Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The aim of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures used by the financial administration in the field of VAT following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "EC") with the free movement of goods and services, as well as the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community deliveries.
(De) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control, with a focus on mutual assistance in the area of VAT, in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.
The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Federal Court of Justice ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the utilisation of information obtained through international mutual assistance between financial administrations and the comparison of sales tax management systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the tests was prepared in accordance with the European guideline No 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI exam standards.
The audited period covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two auditors.
In addition to the focus on "exchange of information" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and Commission Regulation 1925 / 2004, other closely related aspects have also been examined, such as the registration of taxable persons, tax returns and summary notifications.
In addition, the audit also covered the legal situation for cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of sales tax administrations in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT purposes.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among other things, the key criterion for registering is exceeding the turnover threshold set out in the VAT law.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the taxable person receives a tax number valid only for domestic sales for the purposes of VAT.
If the German tax collector wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach is tax-free, but there is a right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, as far as the route passes through Germany, the transport service is subject to sales tax.
Efforts should be made at EC level to unify the situation under Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common turnover tax system (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
While in the Czech Republic, taxable income tax returns only have to be issued for under-year tax periods (month or quarter), taxable persons in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
Advance sales tax filings and a return on sales tax after the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax payers in Germany are required to submit VAT advance applications electronically.
The introduction of the electronic levy of VAT declarations in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary reports to the tax authorities (fä), German tax authorities have to submit the summary reports to the CLO2.
Accordingly, in the Czech Republic, the information from the summary reports will be available immediately after their submission.
In German, the information from the summary messages is only available after their processing by the Clo.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community sales is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the time of turnover and the updating of MIAS data.
This would allow for a timely review of taxation in the Member State of the acquirer (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the area of VAT.
In case of requests for information, the Czech Clo will monitor compliance with the three-month period.
The German Clo does not monitor processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the specified period.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended that the German Clo be constantly monitored (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).
As part of the cooperation, the two auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed using the legal options of the Clo, where there were doubts about the correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The auditors found that:
In some cases, the fä used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and re-established the VAT liability of the tax authorities concerned.
In these cases, the tax-payers had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or failed to declare the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the fä could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal provisions in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial management of another Member State refused to provide the information requested.
A number of cases have been uncovered in which tax payers incorrectly reported sales in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly faulty, so that in these cases, the technical staff (the FA) had to investigate (see 6).
Examination procedure
Examination procedure in the CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II - "State Budget Revenue" and the Territorial Examination Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
The audited bodies were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 departments Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of NKÚ approved the audit findings on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedures in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the Traffic Tax Examination Unit and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test began in the 4th quarter of 2006.
In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the audit in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the Clo, the exam was conducted in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax records from the following subjects were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe City, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich bodies, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hanover North, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Cologne-Mitte, Cologne-Porz, Cologne-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau.
In addition, discussions were held with the fä Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results of the exam were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings were held by representatives of both auditors.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the financial administration, the legislation on sales tax and the system of sales tax administration in each other's country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were determined for the parallel tests: 1.
Registration of taxable persons.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the actions of financial officials in the processing of requests for information and the review of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the sales tax area.
At a meeting to vote on the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH in December 2006, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel tests that had already been achieved.

On the first day of the third month after the month in which he crossed the threshold, an entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic, whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000, will be eligible for payment (§ 94 (1) of Law No 235 / 2004 Coll., on VAT; hereinafter "Law No 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxable person if he has exceeded the registration deadline.
An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic, who provides tax-deductible services or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT, must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he fulfils other requirements set out in Law No. 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with legal headquarters, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic, who does not meet any of the requirements set out in the law, can voluntarily apply for VAT registration.
When the application for registration is received by the local financial officer, the registration process begins in accordance with Law No 337 / 1992.
If you want to register voluntarily for VAT, you have to specify in your application the deadline from which you apply for registration as a VAT collector.
The financial officer has to check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all investments.
If he has doubts about the information contained in it, he has to ask the applicant to explain, supplement or prove the information provided.
If the financial officer has verified that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he has to give a written notification of the registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the communication, the financial officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the investment period for the VAT.
The investment period is the calendar quarter, unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the predisposition period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the investment period and has to inform the financial officer of this change.
The issuing of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.
The taxable person must provide the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the financial officer, and also in cases where a special law requires it (e.g. Law No. 235 / 2004 concerning the preparation of tax documents) 3.
The control number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or any other general identification mark, as far as a special law determines it. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of § 33 (12) of Law No. 337 / 1992).
If, despite a request from the financial officer, the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligations, the local financial officer has to register him on his behalf.
A notification will also be issued to the taxman.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur admitted to doing business will receive a tax number for any type of tax when they first register.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
In accordance with Law No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the VAT registration requirement, the tax officer can demand that the taxable person receive up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable turnover, which the person concerned has made unlawfully without taxation, for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a taxable person, until the date on which the registration as a taxable person was made by the financial officer (§ 98 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004).
The payment of the fixed amount is considered a tax payment within the meaning of Section 98 (3) of Law No. 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or a fine.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a taxable person can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Deletion of the registration at the request of the taxable person, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004).
A tax collector can request the deletion of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.
2) deletion of registration on the grounds of office (§ 106 (7) of Law No. 235 / 2004), if: A) the taxable person has not performed in the period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the financial officer of the reasons for this, b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under Law No. 235 / 2004, c) the previous taxable person no longer fulfils the requirements for tax treatment.
B) A person registered for tax purposes in another Member State and in the Czech Republic with no legal place of business, place of business or place of business, or a tax-exempt foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and has to make a tax return and pay taxes ("non-resident entrepreneur") for these services or supplies in accordance with Section 108 of Law No. 235 / 2004, will be tax-exempt with the provision of the service in question.
He must submit an application for registration with FA Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.
In this application, he is required to indicate all UST IDs allocated to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic, the Prague 1 FA will have to register him retrospectively, as he became taxable on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic, in accordance with Law No. 235 / 2004.
In the event of a retroactive registration, the Prague 1 FA will have to request proof of performance from the companies concerned (invoices or written explanations).
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, the Prague 1 FA will have to ask for the submission of the performance-based contract documents.
As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, of which 124 were from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 106 (9) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the financial officer is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of January 31 of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to file tax filings or returns and to pay tax.
When examining the NKÚ, it turned out that, in the event of a tax return being issued by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration had not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of deletion of registration, become known to the FA later than on 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident company for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of taxable persons in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the tax code (§ § 137, 138 AO), any business must be registered with the municipality and / or the relevant tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after the start of business.
The municipality will forward the application to the tax authorities.
If the relevant tax office finds that a business activity has been started but has not been registered, it can also retroactively register the taxable person from its office.
In Germany, taxable persons, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are required to register for Zwekke for VAT if they meet the requirements set out in Section 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Foreign entrepreneurs have special responsibilities.
For example, for those entrepreneurs based in the Czech Republic, the ChemnitzSüd FA is responsible.
As of 30 April 2004, 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered with the company; as of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the findings of the Federal Republic of Germany, these companies with special responsibilities frequently refused to register so-called bogus self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since, after the accession of these ten countries to the EC, the free movement of workers is still restricted, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These self-employed persons do not meet the conditions set out in § 2 UStG for recognition as entrepreneurs, as they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the type of work they perform.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill out a questionnaire from the relevant FA and provide information on the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a mandatory form for all fä in Germany.
It will be processed either in special organisational units within the fä or in the organisational units generally responsible for the tax assessment.
With the help of this pressure, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual taxpayer before the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the relevant FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the controller, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This will be allocated by the Clo on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for sales tax purposes.
The VAT ID number is automatically allocated by the Clo when the taxable person declares intra-Community deliveries in his VAT pre-registration or in his annual VAT return.
The UST ID number is composed of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. if he ceases to do business), but only after the completion of all tax procedures (predisposition of all financial years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he no longer runs a business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the fä must inform the Clo of the deletion of the VAT number, so that the validity of the VAT ID number can be terminated there at this time.
According to the VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax-payers do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. The turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting sales tax has not exceeded the amount of €17,500 and 2. In the following year the amount of €50,000 is unlikely to exceed.
The so-called small business owners are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small business owners are required to register with the tax office and make an annual sales tax return.
A small business owner can explain the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He may then charge the VAT and deduct the VAT.
Non-resident taxpayers can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free sales and waive the deduction.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
The invoices indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two countries is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold amount specified in the VAT law.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration process in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur due to different organisational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the taxable person will receive a tax number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In the case of registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for sales tax purposes will receive a tax number exclusively for domestic sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community sales, he has to apply specifically for the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both the NKÚ and the BRH found that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which provides a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community sales, can lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxable person does not register his business with the municipality or the relevant FA.
This retroactive registration allows an accurate estimate of the value added tax for previous investment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the sales tax debt.
As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole EC should be standardised.
The German Parliament recently approved the introduction of a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Office for Taxation to every natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.
If a natural person takes up a business activity, the relevant FA will apply for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a VAT ID number.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a taxable person and the allocation of the VAT ID number.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach
Legislation in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of Section 70 of Law No. 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between individual Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and is entitled to a deduction.
The exemption from VAT applies even if the transport is carried out by persons registered as taxable persons in other Member States or by foreigners who are taxable domestically.
The return journey is considered to be a separate transport process.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the cross-border transport of passengers by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register as taxable in the Czech Republic.
Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT in accordance with the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b), as stated in the text:
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic, in accordance with paragraph 17 of Annex F of the Directive, can either maintain the tax exemption for cross-border passenger transport until the requirement of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is met or as long as the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal requirements in Germany
According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by § 3b (1) UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is carried out.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is taxable in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxable person is transported through Germany, the part of the transport that falls on Germany is considered taxable.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.
This registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and gives a special certificate for each of the buses mentioned in the application of the taxable person.
The entrepreneur must provide his taxable transport services in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA.
If the transport service is provided for a domestically based entrepreneur, the non-resident taxman does not have to pay the sales tax himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic buyer of the services has to pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount charged to the non-resident taxpayer, which is referred to as the "transfer of tax liability" and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax collector and his income tax return, the German financial administration has several means of verifying the accuracy of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger transport:
Mobile customs control groups check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used to transport passengers through Germany.
After each test, the mobile control groups submit an inspection protocol to the relevant FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can ask the bus driver to pay the VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxable person can deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return, it can order an audit to be carried out in the FA, or it can use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally set VAT, the FA may ask for assistance under Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters to be too costly in relation to the low income from VAT on taxable passenger transport.
In particular, the audit of the books of a non-resident taxable person incurs disproportionately high costs for the taxable person himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must examine foreign books, which require knowledge not only of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an audit can be expected to involve a higher amount of time than a resident taxable person, although the audit is limited to passenger transport in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must not only accept the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States where he carries out passenger transport.
In addition, for each Member State in which only one passenger transport is carried out, the taxable person must meet all existing tax requirements in the various languages and on the basis of the forms provided by the financial administrations of the relevant EC Member States.
This means that the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services will result in a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Czech Republic's Act of Accession to the EC.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the route of transport that is to be carried out on German territory.
If, for the first time, a non-resident tax collector provides such a transport service, he must first register it with the relevant FA.
This registers the taxable person who must declare the taxable share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax-payers registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The amount of tax in question is quite low relative to the administrative burden.
The Member States - which levy VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of VAT - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant amount of tax.
In order to avoid the disproportionately high cost of VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be taxable in one Member State.
This could be the state where the transport begins or where the service provider is based.
Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
Sales tax returns
Levy and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise specified by the law, even if no tax liability has been incurred, the entrepreneur will be required to file a VAT return on the pre-print provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the tax period.
The tax liability will be incurred at the end of the period for issuing the VAT return. Exempt from this rule is the VAT on the import of goods in accordance with Law No. 235 / 2004. Here, the due date of the tax is determined in accordance with the customs regulations.
If there is a claim for reimbursement as a result of above-average deductible taxes, this amount will be refunded to the taxable person within 30 days of setting this deduction without having to make an application for it.
The deadline is not applied in cases where the financial officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the taxable person.
According to § 73 (11) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the right to deduct taxes can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct taxes was created.
At the end of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.
An amendment to Act 235 / 2004, which came into force on 1 January 2005, allows the levy of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the claim for a deduction could have been claimed for the first time.
A tax collector must make a supplementary VAT return if: A) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax debt, b) he makes corrections by which the last known tax debt is not changed, but only previous information is changed, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax debt in accordance with Section 49 of Law No. 235 / 2004.
A tax collector can issue a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxable person must submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month, which follows the month in which the facts in question were established.
The sales tax declaration can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or via data carriers.
The delivery via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted to data carriers.
The form for the VAT return contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
The value of related services must be specified in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some headings are used for automated primary checks within the ATIS system.
The value of the goods delivered to persons registered as taxable in other EC Member States is compared with the data provided by the Czech tax authorities in their summary reports.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States from persons registered as taxable there is compared with the information in the summary reports of taxable persons from other EC Member States with the help of the MIAS.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, the FA will carry out a credibility assessment of the sales tax returns.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior audit.
The credibility assessment includes a calculation of the standards of credibility and an assessment of the risks of the sales tax returns.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Law No. 337 / 1992, the FA can repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.
In its audit, the NKÚ found that the fä rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxable person in question if the VAT return was not issued.
Levy and processing of sales tax returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly sales tax filings and annual sales tax returns.
However, those taxable persons who are ploughed into paying VAT pre-registration must make an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners who are not ploughed into paying VAT will have to make an annual sales tax return.
The tax-payers are, in principle, obliged to submit a VAT advance notification by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the VAT is generated (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, in the previous year, if the VAT debt is more than €6,136, or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur will be required to file monthly VAT advance applications at the latest by the 10th day after the end of the month in question.
The taxable person can also opt for the levy of monthly VAT pre-registration if he has received a refund of €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual sales tax is no more than €512, neither sales tax declarations nor sales tax declarations must be made.
A resulting VAT debt must be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial management.
(Statutory) deadlines for processing VAT returns and for refunding VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security can be offered for the refund amount.
In principle, sales tax returns, including refunds, must be processed quickly.
The German VAT Act allows for an extension of these (levy or payment) periods (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the levy of VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made a month later, but in the case of monthly notifications, a special advance payment must be made.
This payment will be offset against the VAT debt established for the pre-registration period in December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT advance notice.
There is no "supplementary" VAT return.
Once the sales tax return submitted to the tax office by 31 May of the following year has been submitted, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT advance notification, but only the incorrect annual sales tax return.
Corrections to this VAT return to the benefit or disadvantage of the taxable person are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was issued.
After the expiry of this four-year period, a sales tax return can usually only be corrected in cases of a light-hearted tax cut or tax evasion.
The tax-payers must submit the VAT advance applications electronically.
The fä can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid unreasonable hardship.
The annual sales tax return can be issued either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the levy is made without certification, the taxman must also make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
In the event that no VAT advance declarations or declarations are made, the financial administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the tax-payer 6.
In the event of a late levy, the taxable person can be charged a late surcharge (up to 10% of the tax debt or up to €25,000).
In an earlier review, the BRH found that the fä often do not charge this late surcharge.
In the cases in which the fä levied the late surcharges, the amount was fixed inconsistently and arbitrarily.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, particularly when issuing the annual sales tax return.
The preprint of the VAT return contains separate lines for value information on intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions.
There are also separate lines for the provision of services.
Non-taxable sales must be stated in a separate line of the VAT return.
The sales tax returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically submitted tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Once all data is collected electronically, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.
The sales tax returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible person on the basis of the automatically drawn up audit notes (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT debt, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the taxable person, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year, the tax payers have to file their advance applications no later than 10 days after either the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
The annual sales tax declaration must be made by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The plan to issue an annual sales tax return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxable person can correct the errors in the monthly advance registrations by submitting a single VAT return;
- if the taxpayer corrects his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
- The federal states do not match MIAS data on intra-Community purchases of German tax collectors until the annual sales tax returns are usually processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This levy allows the German financial administration to verify compliance with the turnover cap for small business owners.
In addition, the competent FA can match the annual sales tax declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and the annual accounts of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the financial administration can only check the level of turnover on the basis of the income tax return issued.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax-payers are ploughed into the electronic levy of VAT pre-registration.
The introduction of the levy on electronic tax returns in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary notifications
Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law No. 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes must submit corresponding summary notices (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").
The value of the delivered goods is always stated in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down according to the UST-IdNr7, the individual taxable persons under whom they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
The taxable persons with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period have to hand over the ZM to the local FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in an Amending ZM within 15 days of finding the error.
Faulty data in the ZM is always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to tax returns, the tax payers can also hand over the ZM electronically.
If a tax collector does not issue a ZM or Amending ZM, although he is required to do so by law no. 235 / 2004, the financial officer has to ask him to hand over the relevant ZM, pointing out the consequences of the non-levy. In the event of non-payment of non-monetary payments, the financial officer has the power to repeatedly impose fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with section 37 of law no. 337 / 1992.
In its audit, the NKÚ found that the fä mostly did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting tax payers.
In particular, in the case of the ZM levy, the tax-payers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, since the failure to levy a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT debt.
In accordance with Section 102 (5) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the financial officer is required to check the information in the ZM or amending ZM, to remove any ambiguity and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of disagreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which the taxman corrects incorrect information in the ZM by submitting an amending ZM either on his own initiative or on request.
The financial officer has to correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- the controller does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or Amending ZM) and therefore corrects it by issuing an Amending ZM;
- the financial officer has demonstrated the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxable person in the ZM or Amending ZM.
Notifications entered by the financial officer, without any corrective ZM being issued by the tax-payer, do not replace the tax-payer's pledge to provide a corrective ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are current, complete and accurate.
The data from the ZM will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.
Only the national financial authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of VAT may transmit and receive this data.
This is the Clo (in the Czech Republic, this function is carried out by the Department of International Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance), and the "O _ MCTL" message is automatically sent to the Clo from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect UST IDs specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect UST ID number is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry in the list of the wrong UST ID number is made.
The list contains a "Notice of doubt concerning UST-IdNr."
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxable person must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the lines of the VAT return for that purpose.
Selected cases of differences between the value of the purchases made by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return and the value of the goods delivered by the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM will be forwarded by the Clo to the competent FA for examination.
The staff there must investigate the discrepancies.
There can then be three different situations:
A) The value indicated by the Czech acquirer in the relevant headings of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer checks the accuracy of the information.
B) The difference is zero.
This situation can be caused either by a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or by a change in the information in the sales tax return (the Czech tax collector, meanwhile, makes a supplementary sales tax return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to check the accuracy of the information in the sales tax return.
C) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States, as indicated by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return, is higher than the value of the goods delivered by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
This, in turn, is the discretion of the financial officer to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer submits the results of his review to ATIS.
These results will be forwarded to the Clo.
The number of transactions sent by the Clo for examination can be seen for the individual quarters of 2005 in Figure 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases transmitted by the Clo has decreased for each quarter of 2005.
The significant reduction in the number of cases in the 4th quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech Clo has raised the threshold for case selection, taking into account the minimum threshold for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic buyer.
There may also be an error of the taxable person in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries in the ZM are given differently in the individual EC Member States.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions found in the audited cases can be seen in Table 1.
Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must hand over ZM quarterly, which lists intra-Community deliveries to purchasers (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be delivered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a permanent extension is granted for the levy of VAT pre-registration, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be handed over to the Clo.
Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been mandatory.
The FA responsible can allow exemptions for individual tax havens in order to avoid unreasonable hardship.
If the taxman finds that the ZM was faulty, he will be ploughed into submission of an Amending ZM within a month.
If the ZM is not handed over, the Clo will initiate an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, coupled with the threat that a penalty will be imposed and - fixing the penalty.
Although the German tax code allows a penalty of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO) to be set, the Clo sets penalties of €125, 250 and 500 in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 of the German Civil Code (UStG) stipulates that the taxable person acts in an unlawful manner if he intentionally or lightly fails to deliver a ZM correctly, not completely or in time, or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in time.
This offence can be punishable by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the fä, because the Clo is exclusively responsible for the processing of the ZM.
The data of the ZM is only stored at the Clo.
The information from the summary messages is only available to the fä after their processing by the Clo.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect VAT ID number in the ZM of German taxpayers, the German Clo will receive a notification "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The Clo then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the right data.
If the Clo fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be referred to the relevant FA.
It is then up to him to request the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID number at the request of the Clo.
However, the memory, the threat and the imposition of up to three consecutive fines, takes too much time when a tax collector may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were ultimately reported to the relevant authorities, were usually closed within one to two months.
The FA, which is responsible for each case, refused to grant the tax exemption for the reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases.
If the taxman presented the correct VAT ID number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the Clo because the FA could not correct the MIAS data itself.
The BRH found that neither the fä nor the Clo controlled the levy of the corrected ZM.
As the Clo does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information provided in the VAT advance reports or the VAT return on goods deliveries with the corresponding information in the ZM before this data is sent to the Clo of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be made by the fä, which is usually done in preparation for a special VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by the Clo.
Incorrect VAT ID numbers are detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used to control labour market taxation in the fä.
As soon as they are available in the system, it compares the Clo with the data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications will be prepared and sent to the relevant subject.
This happens on an ongoing basis, whereas a dissemination of the acquisition data of all persons subject to VAT will be produced later and forwarded to the fä.
The Risk Management System (RMS) for the investment process then compares this data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.
The system checks in full (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State will have to hand over a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The fä process the ZM and forward the data to the Clo.
The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the taxable persons in the ZM are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same taxable persons in their VAT returns.
The results of the settlement will be taken into account in the context of the tax setting.
In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries are required to pay quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, the tax authorities have had to submit the ZM electronically to the Clo.
The data from the ZM are only available to the fä after their processing at the Clo.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, the tax payers in the ZM only provide the goods.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech fä, the German fä cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the ZM.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect UST ID numbers were not corrected even if the controller informed the FA of the correct UST ID number.
The German financial administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German tax-payers in their VAT pre-registration with the information provided by the relevant ZM.
Differences between the pre-registration data and the ZM are not regularly revealed before the German Clo transfers the MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings by the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.
In the Czech Republic, the data provided by other Member States on the supply of goods to Czech taxpayers is compared with the data on the purchases of goods provided by Czech tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The Czech Clo makes the comparison for each calendar quarter separately.
The most serious cases of deviations will be referred to the fä for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control will only be carried out in the case of taxable persons who are not fully entitled to the deduction.
In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxable persons if the RMS produces an audit report or if the taxable person has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves the fä from clarifying the reasons for any differences.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current system of ZM, in particular MIAS, provides financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This delay could be reduced to up to four months if the tax-payers had to hand over monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would only marginally increase the bureaucratic burden, as most tax payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are already ploughed into issuing monthly sales tax returns or pre-registrations, and no more information is required for the ZM than for the sales tax returns or pre-registrations.
In order to avoid red tape, the levy of the ZM could be linked to the levy of sales tax declarations or advance declarations.
However, a levy on the monthly levy of ZM would create more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community deliveries and those on intra-Community purchases, and would increase the flow of data between the Clo.
In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the Clo of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order to have an effect on the monthly levy of ZM, it is necessary to agree on the single monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on goods deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both auditors requested data on the number of false tax numbers or VAT ID numbers in the O _ MCTL notifications, which were exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each of the audited quarters.
These data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different basis for calculating the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech Clo refers the numbers to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German Clo refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTL was reported.
International exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows financial officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the tax payers who have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, repealing Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003"), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: The exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request takes place through a request for information (English: Request for information RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.
Financial officials in the Czech Republic will send their RFI or their replies to a RFI received by the Finance Directorate to the Clo, which will be responsible for translating the information provided in the standardised SCAC form into the foreign language and forwarding it to the other Member States.
In addition, the Clo receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and answers to requests sent. It provides for their translation into the Czech Republic and their distribution to the relevant subject for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFI exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by the NKÚ.
Out of the total number of 94 RFI received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were dealt with within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%), this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the NKÚ had examined it. More detailed information on the deadlines within which the Czech Republic responded to requests made by Germany can be found in Figure 2.
Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, a response was received in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this period and in 19 cases no response had yet been received from Germany at the time of the examination by the NKÚ (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to determine when Germany answered the request for information on the basis of the information provided).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests for information from the Czech Republic and Germany were answered can be found in Figure 3.
The percentages of intra-Community turnover reported in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.
The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information were mostly worth more than €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Financial officials in other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for determining the VAT debt.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the Clo.
The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.
"Automatic exchange" under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transfer of previously defined information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transfer of previously defined information to another Member State without its prior request, once the relevant information is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
This information is obtained by the financial officer from the form notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with Section 19 of Law No. 235 / 2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer will enter the required data into the relevant document template and forward it directly to the responsible employee of the Finance Directorate, where the data will be collected and sent to the Clo for further processing, after which the data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides information to other Member States on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear to be inadmissible and on potential "missing traders."
This information will be transmitted to the other Member States via an SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the local FA.
The fä send the completed form SCAC 2004 by email directly to the German Clo, which forwards the SCACPreprints to the foreign Clo.
The fä are instructed to submit their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCACVordruck used is in German.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the Federal Republic of Germany were sent in order to ensure income tax in the other Member State or to prove the tax freedom of intra-Community delivery from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German Clo receives a request for information from another Member State, it will check whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount of €15,000.
If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German Clo refuses to provide information on a turnover below the minimum threshold.
In addition, the German Clo provides for the translation of the freely worded texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)], if they are neither written in German nor in English.
In response to the request for information, the Clo directs it to the relevant FA, referring to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German Clo has the technical means to monitor the keeping of deadlines, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FA of the unfinished requests for information.
The fä receive the required information by writing to the controller or conducting an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: The special VAT audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
In this short and flexible form of audit, it is not necessary to make an announcement to the taxable person, and it has proved its worth in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the case of the automatic exchange of information, Germany will send the following information to the other Member State: - on VAT, which has been allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - on the reimbursement of VAT to companies established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has pledged to provide the following information to the other EU Member States as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:
A. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without UStIdNr., b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States that are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant discrepancies between the purchases reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of items that have been improperly taxed by the taxable person in Germany, e. Potential "Missing Traders" who have made intra-Community transactions, regardless of whether their UStID number is still valid or has already been deleted, and f. Taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential "Missing Traders" or to customers who have improperly used a VAT number.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information and / or spontaneous information takes place both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local authorities, who transmit the relevant SCAC forms to the Clo.
While the Czech Clo uses bilingual SCACPreprints (Czech-English) and translates the information provided into English or German, the German ones follow the instruction to submit requests for information or spontaneous information in a monolingual form only in German.
The German Clo does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration completed 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information sent to Germany were only handled by the German financial administration in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German Clo points to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of requests for information that are answered on time.
That is why the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German Clo.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German Clo is now reminding the tax authorities of the answer to the outstanding requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of VAT.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Department of Methodology and Economic Administration of Value Added Tax, or its Risk Management Unit, is looking at identifying potential risk factors for tax revenue and evaluating trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the "credibility of VAT returns" criterion and uses the MIAS data to discover possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates risky goods, conceptually prepares risk management in the area of VAT and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.
The Department for International Assistance in the field of VAT provides, among other things, for the exchange of information, contributes to the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system from other Member States, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.

The Tax Audit and Tax Investigation Methodology Department conducts risk analyses, among other things, within the framework of the methodical management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, produces risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from financial management and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigators are in charge of the financial directorates. Their tasks include searching for tax-dodgers and industries that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), searching for unregistered tax-dodgers (e.g. in the Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), investigating links in chain fraud cases and informing local financial authorities.
Special exam units have been set up in 12 selected subjects.
They have a regional competence and carry out tax audits outside the local area of competence of the fä, on the basis of appropriate authorisation.
The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in connection with chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of tax investigators or focus on tax dodgers with certain activities, multinational companies and tax dodgers with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk effectiveness of tax returns issued; - the task of "selecting the taxable persons to be audited," selecting the taxable persons to be audited on the basis of certain criteria; - the task of "MIAS," which allows financial officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The "MIAS" task enables, among other things, the following: - verification of the validity of the VAT ID number of taxable persons from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxable person, as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the taxable person in question from other Member States, - preparation of a list of taxable persons who have not provided ZM, - formal control of the information provided by taxable persons in the Czech Republic in their ZM before this information is transmitted to other Member States, - preparation of a list of taxable persons whose VAT returns do not match the information on goods delivered to other Member States with the information provided in the ZM, - preparation of a list of taxable persons whose tax returns are not in accordance with the value of the other Member States, the information on the value of the goods obtained from their suppliers in the other Member States.
As part of their mission to combat tax evasion, financial officials have access to data from state authorities such as the Commercial Register, Land Registry, Motor Vehicle Registry, Trade Registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 of the Comprehensive Notices in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the Clo) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the Clo nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a complete set of data.
At the level of the Clo, the unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as the "Kuss" - Coordination Unit for Special Sales Tax Examinations and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the audit findings on fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER was set up for the kiss, where the tax authorities can enter and query the names of discovered missing traders or sales tax fraudsters.
The Kuss coordinates related cases of VAT fraud at the national level as well as cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experience of the kiss is brought into the development of the RMS through their cooperation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organisational units of the Clo and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of VAT numbers of other Member States, which appear in the ZM of German tax authorities, will be carried out at the Clo.
This formal review will take place prior to the transfer of the ZM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validity of the UST ID number mentioned in the ZM will be assessed on the basis of the O _ MCTL identifiers provided by the other Member States (for the procedure of correcting invalid UST ID numbers, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the Clo's RMS relies on the MIAS data provided by the other Member States and generates various types of communications for the discovery of suspected Missing Traders, using certain characteristics that usually occur in carousel transactions as clues.
Federal prosecutors are instructed to process these communications and, in certain cases, have to forward the outcome of their investigations to the Clo.
The BRH's audit has confirmed that all available features must be included in order to conclude with sufficient probability a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended that the BMF work with combinations of different clues in the preparation of the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other clues, such as the payment behaviour of the tax-payer, the business sector or the company's shareholding relationships.
A second level of risk management is provided by the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of sales tax filings and annual declarations.
For example, the system creates a list of those taxable persons who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT advance or annual declaration.
This list will be sent to the Clo to monitor the full delivery of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions given by the taxable person in his annual sales tax return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The financial administrations of the federal states avoid comparing the quarterly data, as it would result in too many discrepancies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
- Suppliers and purchasers expect different times for the execution of intra-Community sales;
- different accounting and tax declarations of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the data from the sales tax returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms, which are based on information in the sales tax returns and certain other clues (e.g. company word, age of the owner / shareholder, number of employees and method of payment of the tax payer).
Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way as to identify suspected tax fraudsters.
This system is used in the processing of VAT advance notices.
This will give the relevant FA the advice of the RMS before the sales tax is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers have to adjust the rules according to feedback from the fä.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of uncovered cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system creates a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent authorities will decide on the audit of the taxable persons concerned.
After the audit, the auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed sales tax returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also known as the datamining system) calculates how likely a tax collector is to be involved in tax fraud.
It then creates a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, the subjects select the relevant tax authorities for examination and report the audit results to the data centre in question.
The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems appears to be effective.
It remains to be seen whether the desired effects will materialise in actual use.
Comparison and evaluation
While it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
As well as the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - particularly carousel fraud - has proved to be not a national problem, but a European one.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches to an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State, and if this does not happen, fraudsters will seek out the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is based.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud can be affected.
This is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales As part of the parallel audits, the NKÚ and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries, respectively.
Acquisitions that were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two jurisdictions jointly examined the handling of several deliveries, which were in doubt about their implementation, or which the tax authorities of both states explained differently in the tax returns or in the ZM.
At the request of the BRH, the NKÚ investigated a total of eight business incidents between eight Czech and eight German tax authorities.
In addition, in 43 cases, the NKÚ examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, as indicated by Czech tax authorities in their tax returns and ZM, on the basis of information provided by the BRH.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the Clo.
The examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax collector purchased goods worth €60,500 from a German tax collector.
When the Czech taxpayer declared a purchase of only €29,869, the Czech financial administration sent a request for information to Germany in order to verify the value of the goods delivered.
In its response to the Czech request for information, the German side said that the German taxpayer in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to his Czech business partner in the 2nd quarter of 2004, goods worth €31,997 in the third quarter and goods worth €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
The answer also revealed that the VAT ID number of the German taxable person was not valid until 28 September 2004, but the German Clo had accepted another request from the German taxable person and had retroactively brought forward the validity of the VAT ID number as of 1 May 2004.
The German tax authority corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was a (intra-Community) acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
In a request to the relevant tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech taxable person had issued supplementary VAT returns for the individual (under-age) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States, while at the same time seeking the deduction of VAT from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional sales tax declarations, the competent representative of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the declared acquisitions also included the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered in September 2003 as subject to sales tax.
At the time of registration, however, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only a tax number that was finally valid for Germany.
Although in Germany it is usually not possible to retroactively allocate a VAT ID number to a taxable person, in 2006 the responsible person in charge of the German financial administration did so retroactively on 1 May 2004.
The German Clo retrospectively allocates a VAT ID number if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; for example, if the Clo caused the delay following the request of the taxable person to grant a VAT ID number.
In this case, the Clo retroactively grants the VAT ID number, because the entrepreneur does not need a valid VAT ID number for an intra-community delivery, according to § 6 UStG.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) VAT ID number of its supplier to declare the intra-Community acquisition.
Due to these procedural differences between the Member States, the German Clo retroactively granted the VAT ID number in this particular case.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech financial officer asked for a review of the German entrepreneur's sales tax registration.
According to the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
In their response, the German authorities announced that the German taxpayer had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons had only been allocated a VAT ID number in Germany on 16 February 2005.
Through a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ learned that the financial officer had carried out a VAT audit on the Czech taxable person for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this audit, the tax office found that the Czech taxable person had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897, which he had provided to the German taxable person prior to his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) Tax Office fixed a tax debt of CZK 1,880 for the third quarter of 2004 in relation to the Czech taxpayer.
On the basis of the NKÚ request, the BRH found that the German taxpayer had only been allocated the VAT ID number when he applied to the FA on 16 February 2005 for his company, which was founded in 2004.
In addition, the FA retroactively registered him from 1 October 200415 for the purposes of VAT, in order to be able to monitor the levy of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the taxable person indicated intra-Community purchases from the Czech Republic worth 160 €(approx. 5,000 CZK).
3. In his VAT return for September 2004 as well as in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax collector gave goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German tax collector.
When reviewing the registration of the German taxable person in the MIAS system, the Czech financial officer found that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and therefore after the goods were delivered to Germany.
The Czech tax collector issued a supplementary sales tax return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
In a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxman subsequently submitted a request for the resumption of the tax procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return, as evidence he submitted a confirmation from the German financial administration that the German taxable person had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech financial officer reviewed the validity of the registration of the German taxable person in the context of the international exchange of information.
According to the German information, the German taxpayer was not assigned a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech finance official rejected the request to reopen the tax procedure.
The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place, because the German taxable person had only received a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004.
However, the German beneficiary explained both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the VAT on it, and also demanded the reimbursement of taxes of the same amount.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the German tax payer's tax liability, the German financial officer did not correct the information in the VAT return.
Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German taxman mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, which led to confusion between two German tax authorities.
This change in the name of the German taxman also confused the Czech financial officer.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial officer reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax collector from a German tax collector worth €22,686.
In a request to the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial officer had examined, in the course of an external audit with the Czech tax authority, whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxman had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech tax collector did not declare the intra-Community acquisition in his sales tax return, because the German supplier did not specify his VAT ID number in the invoice, but only his tax number for transactions within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German taxable person will not be registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community sales until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxable person.
The Czech finance official also requested that the German financial administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax collector, so that he could, if necessary, initiate an appropriate tax procedure.
The Czech FA considered this business to be the purchase of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose VAT on the purchase of goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law, a taxable person who delivers goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such deliveries.
The supplier must only have the purchaser's VAT number in the other Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, according to German tax law, turnover is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply, which should be subject to income tax in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech financial officer took note of this business incident because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German Clo rejects requests for information on intra-Community sales if they are below the minimum threshold of €15,000:5.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax collector purchased goods worth €12,561 from a German tax collector.
The Czech financial officer carried out an audit for this tax period.
As part of the intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration asked for the examination of this supply of goods by means of an SCAC form.
The Czech taxman said he had not received the goods, had never been in business with the German company and that he had not registered the purchase of the goods in question.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transfer of receipts - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
As the Czech financial officer did not receive any documentation for the subsequent taxation of the acquired goods, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax fix was in place.
On the basis of a request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as a "fiscal representative 17" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German tax collector explained these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
In section 4.6.1, it was shown that the answers of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the answers of the Czech financial administration:
6. In its audit, the NKÚ found that on 5 October 2005, the Czech financial administration had sent a request for information on the value of shipments to Germany in the 4th quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxable person reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxable person worth €86,307, but the Czech taxable person only declared the purchase of goods worth €35,314 in his VAT return for the same period.
In response to the request for information, which was sent to the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period set out in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side announced that the request for information could not be processed because the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German financial administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech financial officer asked for a review of a third and fourth quarter 2004 delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxman worth €1,265,554, using an SCAC form, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ noted that at the time of its examination, a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
In a request to the local financial officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxman had not declared in his VAT return the delivery of new vehicles to this German taxable person, worth CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech financial officer corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax officer issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German Clo did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out by the German buyer in Germany, which found that the purchase of all the vehicles in question had been correctly taxed, and that the vehicles were sold to other taxable persons in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, in the 4th quarter of 2004, the Czech taxman purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German taxman.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
In a request to the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not issued a VAT return since August 2004.
Even after being asked to do so by the financial officer, the Czech taxman did not issue any tax returns, and as a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the VAT debt at zero for the period October to December 2004.
On 2 June 2005, the Clo issued an order to examine the aforementioned delivery from the German taxpayer.
As the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the financial officer, he made a request for information on the above delivery to Germany.
As the answer to the request for information was only received on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the conclusion of the NKÚ audit how the Czech financial officer used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to non-compliance with the requirements of the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech taxable person was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial reply was sent because at the time of the NKÚ and BRH audit, the relevant FA had not yet completed the external audit:
9.
In 2005, the Czech financial officer asked for a review of the delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxman worth €16,991 in the third quarter of 2004, using an SCAC form, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his response to the request for information, the German finance official said that he had only received invoices issued by the Czech tax authorities for deliveries worth €16,335.
On the basis of the NKÚ request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed by the acquirer in Germany.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 double in its sales tax filings for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech finance official asked for a review of the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxman worth €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, using an SCAC form, showing signs of carousel fraud.
The German financial administration sent a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer had purchased several motor vehicles, and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NKÚ found that the local FA had carried out several external audits with the Czech tax authority in order to verify the deduction of above-average taxes.
However, an unauthorised claim has not been established.
The BRH found that for the period in question, the German taxpayer had declared in his VAT returns the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579,114, and that the examination of the German FA by the acquirer in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the receiver's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, it emerged that periodic inconsistencies 18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-community supply of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from MIAS, in the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxable person purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German taxable person, but the Czech taxable person did not declare this acquisition.
As the Czech taxman did not cooperate with the financial officer and did not do business at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech financial officer asked for a review of how the German taxman had communicated with the Czech authorities as part of the international exchange of information.
The German response to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German financial administration, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed carrier.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German taxpayer only delivered goods worth €21,659.
The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer a false confirmation of payment of €155,153 in favour of the German taxpayer.
After exposing the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German tax collector, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the delivered material with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
In a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received, the financial administration subsequently taxed the turnover of goods from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.
Following a request from the NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that after corrections, the German supplier had only reported a consignment of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth €7,916.
In accordance with the German legislation, the German taxpayer declared the withdrawal of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the rescission.
His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech tax authorities:
12.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration asked for a review of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a SCACPressure.
According to the request for information, in the period in question, the Czech taxpayer had supplied the German taxable goods with a total value of €396,126 and provided services worth €11,885.
The NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration had carried out an audit with the Czech tax authority to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech financial administration announced that the Czech tax collector had supplied and assembled a production plant for the German company.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant prior to the Czech Republic's accession to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German tax collector did not take down the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer charged the German company the production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer received the refunds, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
Through a request to the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that all invoices in the Czech taxable person's books had been properly recorded.
The sales tax returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer and related to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH found that, in response to the response of the Czech financial administration, the local FA concluded that these transactions were a single (goods) delivery of the Czech tax payer to the German taxpayer, including the assembly.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German service recipient of the factory delivery owes the sales tax in accordance with the German sales tax law.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of the same amount.
As the turnover tax liability of the German taxable person remained unchanged, the German FA did not correct the VAT return.
13. According to the MIAS data, in February 2005 the Czech taxman A purchased a machine worth €58,000 from the German taxman C.
The Czech finance official sent a request to Germany to verify this information.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German tax lifter C delivered this machine to the Czech tax lifter B in 2004, but returned it to the German tax lifter C in October 2004.
According to information from the German financial administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German tax authority C in the Czech Republic.
In response to the request for information, it was also revealed that in February 2005, the German taxman C delivered the machine to the Czech taxman A.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxman's office in the Czech Republic.
As this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.
In a request to the local financial officer responsible for the taxable person B, the NKÚ found that, according to the MIAS data, the German taxable person C had delivered goods (another machine) worth €88,027 to the Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.
The taxman B said he did not receive the goods, so the local Czech financial officer sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations into the taxable person B, the financial officer found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been registered with the taxable person B and that it could be the same type of machine that the branch of the German taxable person C had delivered to the Czech taxable person A in February 2005.
The NKÚ also found that the Czech financial officer in charge of Tax Officer A had carried out an audit on the latter.
The financial officer had the invoice from the German tax authority C dated February 7, 2005, in which the taxable person A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech finance official noted that the taxable person A had not recorded this bill.
Taxable A had entered into a lease agreement with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company delivered the machine on 9 February 2005 and also provided transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the taxable person A.
The BRH found that the German taxable C had delivered the machine, worth €88,027, not to the Czech Republic, but to another German taxable D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a tax-exempt delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German financial officer did not recognise the claim of the German tax-exempt C for VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German controller D delivered the machine to the Czech controller B.
Under German law, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also found that in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005, the German tax authority C had indicated the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax authority A.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The figure below shows the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above transactions.
14.
When examining requests for information received, the NKÚ found that on 4 October 2005, the Czech financial administration had received a request for information from Germany, in which a German financial officer asked for the review of intra-Community deliveries of a German tax payer worth €879,680,625 to a Czech tax payer.
The German finance official said there was a suspicion that this was a ﬁktive intra-Community supply of goods.
The German taxpayer has not been active in business since 1999.
The NKÚ found that the Czech financial officer had carried out an external audit with the Czech tax authority.
The head of the Czech company said that this was probably a claim made by the German tax-payer to the German financial administration, which the Czech tax-payer had made to the German FA as a shareholder in the German company.
According to the information given to the NKÚ, the Czech finance official has so far no information that the German financial administration is handling the case with regard to the Czech tax payer.
From the information available, it is clear that this was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax collector.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to specify the intra-Community acquisition in the receivers' tax returns (see Section 4.4.1):
15. According to the MIAS data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German tax collector supplied Czech taxable goods with a total value of €33,205.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech financial officer asked for an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its response to this request for information, the German side said that the German taxman had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxman, and that he had personally picked up the other goods.
In a request to the local Czech Fi- nanzbeamer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxman had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the value of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech financial officer recommended a tax audit with the Czech tax collector.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a German tax collector delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech tax collector.
For the same period, a Czech tax collector declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the interstate exchange of information, the Czech financial officer asked for a review of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech tax authorities and the MIAS data.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that after receiving the reply from Germany, the latter had contacted the accountant of the Czech tax collector and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk to the company owner about issuing a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no additional sales tax return has been issued.
The Czech finance official told the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for retroactive VAT fixing for the tax period in question would be met.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German taxpayer.
As part of the interstate exchange of information, the German finance official asked for a review of whether the Czech tax authorities mentioned actually existed, as the alleged capital owner of the German tax collector had set up a number of bogus companies in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech taxman confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax authority, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech taxpayer provided evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech taxable person was not registered as a taxable person in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech finance official provided this information in his response to the request for information to the German financial administration.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax collector had issued a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax audit, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had purchased from a German tax collector and at the same time asserted the right of deduction for the acquisition from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not declare VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary sales tax return issued after the external audit, the Czech financial officer fixed the VAT debt unchanged.
According to Czech law, in this case, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
As a result, the Czech financial officer came to the wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax officer corrected the tax return and demanded the payment of VAT worth €1,600.
In addition, the relevant FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, operators declared intra-Community deliveries that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech finance official received a request for information from the German financial administration on whether the Czech taxman had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German taxman in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied as an attachment by an imprint of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer.
A photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle was also attached to the facility.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech financial officer found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not brought a vehicle into the Czech Republic and indicated that he had no contact with a German tax collector.
The VAT registration certificate, the print of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech financial administration.
With this information, the Czech finance official answered the request for information and said at the same time that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax officer is not based at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the company's managing director is not available.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the tax period in February 2005, the Czech financial officer fixed the tax liability of the Czech taxman at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German financial officer had rejected the German tax payer's claim to exempt this delivery from VAT due to the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the goods purchased in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005, a Czech tax collector was supposed to have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax collector.
As the acquisition declared by the German tax-payer was not in line with the MIAS data, the German financial officer asked for the verification of deliveries and their payment as part of the interstate exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech finance official said that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumed to be a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax collector issued a VAT return and a ZM, which was signed by an unauthorised person, namely the company's shareholder, after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register.
The accountant of the Czech taxman told the financial officer that the owner of the capital had deposited the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
In a request to the local Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the financial officer had recognised the Czech taxable person's claim for VAT exemption for goods deliveries to other Member States, worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German financial officer did not correct the German acquirer's sales tax return, as in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.
Since the previous external audit showed no signs of tax fraud, there is no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT debt.
20. According to the MIAS data, a German tax collector purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 in 2005, after which he had purchased goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.
The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions in his 2004 VAT return or in his 2005 tax return.
In addition, he did not declare any value-related outputs.
Due to these discrepancies, the German FA submitted a request for information concerning the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods totalling CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side asked to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech tax authorities had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech financial administration said that the German request could not be met because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representatives).
The documents provided to the NKÚ by the relevant financial officer show that, together with the managing director of the Czech tax authority, a protocol was drawn up on 30 March 2006 on the commencement of the VAT audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and the period January to December 2005.
At the same time, the tax payer was asked by the financial officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the only managing director expired on 16 May 2005, without the appointment of a new managing director.
The Czech taxpayer has not issued any sales tax returns since April 2006.
As part of the parallel investigation, the NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a previous exchange of information between the two countries.
The two auditors exchanged information on the cases under review through the Clo of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to do tax-exempt business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT ID.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and for their delivery to Austria on behalf of, at the risk and on behalf of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient production capacity of its own, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German tax authority (UDE) based in Germany.
The following illustration shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for installation on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account.
Due to the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out on his own behalf, at his own risk and for his own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the receiver is registered as taxable in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is a different country from the seat state of the Czech company 19.
Accordingly, the delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its sales tax returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The delivery of the remaining wind turbines, which were manufactured in Germany, took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) delivered intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria as well as intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries in its German tax returns or in its ZM issued to the German Clo.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, the cooperation of at least four financial administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.
In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined case designs to show the size of the differences between the data in the VAT returns and the MIAS data caused by the different legislation of 2004.
The audited cases also show that it takes some time for the tax-payers and the tax payers to apply the new legal requirements:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax collector reported shipments of goods totalling CZK 792,977,452 to a German tax collector.
In the same period, another Czech tax collector reported intra-Community deliveries in his ZM to another German tax collector with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
The information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that in both cases it was electricity supplies.
Both Czech taxpayers took into account the above deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No. 235 / 2004, which was in force in 2004.
In a further review of these transactions, an audit group of the NKÚ found that in 2004, different legal requirements were in place for the supply and acquisition of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany.
While in the Czech Republic the tax authorities declared the supplies of electrical energy to be intra-Community supplies of goods in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235 / 2004, which were in force in 2004, according to German legislation, it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable sales in Germany.
The differences in the legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No 635 / 2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. In the examination of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech tax collector declared intra-Community deliveries to a German tax collector for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 totalling CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech tax collector in his ZM for the same period intra-Community deliveries to another German tax collector worth CZK 263,470,776.
Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that in both cases it was a supply of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Law 235 / 2004, which will apply from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy shall be the place where the acquirer has his legal headquarters, his registered office or his place of business for which this delivery is made.
For this reason, the Czech tax authorities should not have specified the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both controllers treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-community supplies led to a difference of 503,881,939 CZK in MIAS.
Closing remarks
The cooperation has achieved the objectives of the BRH and the NKÚ.
Both auditors gained in-depth knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations governing the VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions came to light.
Some of them are worth watching.
On the basis of the audit results, both auditors drew up recommendations on the management of VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a review should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both auditors is the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the field of VAT administration.

Rock night at the shoe factory: Volume at the level of the compressed air hammer
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a rewriting of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Schuhfabrik civic centre: Pure hard rock by three bands who are friends with each other.

Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also sets his own accents for the only covered song of the evening,"Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a highly acclaimed solo to the sound, which is felt even higher than before, and runs through the audience.
A certain volume is, of course, part of the genre of such a hard rock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht, according to information provided by the mixing desk team, the three-part concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the press hammer level, but is still significantly below the controls of the "Wacken Festival," which "The Ignition" refers to on its website.

Trump taunts Kim: 'And then we fell in love"

At the tender age of 72, the married US president has become a new flame.

"I was tough, he was tough, and it went back and forth between us," Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?

Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the success of the negotiations on North Korea's denuclearization, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Secretary of State Ri is calling for Washington to be accommodated.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the US government at the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest stalemate comes as the US is building on coercive measures that are lethal to building confidence," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
The fact that punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a dream of people who don't know us."
However, in order to build confidence, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri pointed out.
However, there was no "corresponding reaction" from the US side, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, the UN Security Council decided to impose sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
Us President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for strict compliance with the punitive measures at the United Nations in recent days.

DFB boss in the firing line: Özil Causa: Erdogan's sharp attack on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious accusations.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for the authority of interpretation in the long-running dispute over Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticised the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the head of the DFB defended the association line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally harshly attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the caucus at the ZDF "sports studio" in Mainz.
"In the future - because we also have a lot of migrant players in the submarines - we have to draw very precise conclusions that this kind of thing does not happen again," said the 57-year-old, who wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.

They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England,"Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Honestly, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen up to the German national team, have been excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt he had been "treated sensibly by the DFB."
At the same time, he announced that he would introduce himself to players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - it's not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I have always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a result, an additional integration officer will now be appointed alongside the Brazilian native Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says:" The issue is important, we have to take care of it,"it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person following the World Cup exit and the Özil affair, he intends to run for the post of DFB president again next year.
"I'm doing my job and I'm trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is designed to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still only be taken with explicit consent, emphasizes SwissTransplant.
(DPA) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be accessed by SwissTransplant if required.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, emphasizes SwissTransplant.
It is estimated that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the SwissTransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the deceased's wish.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system is already in place in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker Albert, says.

According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless they or relatives disagree.

After Sulawesi tsunami, Indonesians talk about the situation on the ground
In an interview with the editorial network Deutschland (RND), local resident Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes happened, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive for more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport in Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?

Some are staying in front of their homes, and there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The civil service has been completely shut down and the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the inmates are walking around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does the communication and information supply on the island work?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but it didn't work before and we only got information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they don't know if they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many people thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then it came.
In other regions that have not been hit by the tsunami, there has been misinformation that a tsunami is hitting the region and they have run into the surrounding mountains.

It requires a high level of organisational, technical and financial effort.
In the development and development of a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises often have to be made with European and national policy objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.
It is precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures that the construction of the transport infrastructure is costly.
In planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save significant financial resources and use them for other useful purposes through careful action and decision making.
One of the tasks of state auditing authorities is to identify deficiencies that prevent the best possible savings, efficiency and effectiveness in spending on the construction of transport facilities.
The audit authorities should not only draw the attention of the administrations to the shortcomings identified, but also make suggestions for improvements for the benefit of the citizens and for the benefit of Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Audit Office (BRH) and the nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NKÚ), carried out parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the Prague - Dresden motorway (motorway D 8 in the Czech Republic and motorway A 17 in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The two motorways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by the two states.
The cooperation with the NKÚ enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth assessment of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.
The NKÚ received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons as part of its cooperation with the BRH.
In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.
In line with the progress of the planning process, the deadline for completion was finally set at the end of 2006.
However, during the tendering process, the road and motorway directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made mistakes that delayed the process and shortened the available construction time.
The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.
The contractor secured the accelerated construction of the bridge until the end of 2006.
For this, however, the RMD had to accept significant additional costs.
As part of the joint audit, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and the A 17 were compared, and the size of the bridge area was the benchmark for comparing the price of the bridges.
A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square metre.
The analysis showed that the border bridge under the major bridges, with lengths of more than 100 metres, was the most expensive.
This was also due to the increase in prices as a result of the delays in the award process.
The comparison of tunnel construction prices showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are significantly higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
In future audits of the cost-effectiveness of transport infrastructure spending, both BRH and NKÚ will be able to rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices.
Both auditors recommend that bridge constructions should be standardised and that steel composite and special constructions should only be carried out where reinforced concrete constructions are unsuitable.
The course of the exam was characterised by teamwork and an open approach.
During the parallel test, the examiners on both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.
Introduction
The subject of this report is the parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The focus of the audit was on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of funds.
The parallel tests were carried out by the BRH in Germany and the NKÚ in the Czech Republic.
In 2005 and 2006.
The NKÚ examined the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of spending on the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway, amounting to around CZK 20 billion gross (around €690 million).
Of this amount, €64 million will be made available from the EU Structural Funds (ISPA).
The BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A17 motorway in the years 2003 to 2005, regardless of the parallel tests with the NKÚ.
Of the financial volume for the construction of all three sections of the A 17 of around €670 million, €277 million will be co-financed by the European Fund (ERDF).
The Prague - Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV Dresden - Central and South-Eastern Europe - Istanbul.
The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech-German border,
The A 17 from the border to Dresden.
At the time of the test, the borderline sections of the motorways were under construction.
Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.
While the motorway has thus been completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 on the Czech side remains incomplete, as the 0805 section of the route, which covers a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice, is still in the planning phase.
This is where the crossing of a protected landscape area in the Bohemian Central Mountains is planned.
According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the volume of traffic in 2008 in the borderline section 0807 of the D 8 motorway will be 22 940 cars per day.
German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A17 at the Czech border in 2010 to be around 25,000 cars per day.
In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic signed a contract for the merger of the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 on the common state border by establishing a border bridge.
Since both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this single construction measure has been an important aspect of the parallel audits of both courts of auditors.
Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ
From the middle of 2005, both courts of auditors began to work together to examine the construction of the Prague - Dresden motorway.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1.
Germany is partly financing the construction of the border bridge.
Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Construction Administration.
There was no way for the BRH to examine this project itself.
2.
The NKÚ did not have any comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly with regard to the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8.
3.
The NKÚ also had to examine the effectiveness of the expenditure, in order to examine the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.
After preparatory negotiations, the presidents of the two auditors concluded an agreement on the coordination of the audits of the Prague - Dresden motorway on 04 January 2006.
The auditors of both auditors met in the course of 2006 at intervals of about six to eight weeks.
In doing so, they dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for checking bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results on the construction of the border bridge and produced joint reports.
The ongoing exchange of information was essential to the cooperation.
While the BRH mainly focused on comparing the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the procurement procedures, the NKÚ mainly developed the methodology for analysing bridge and tunnel prices.
In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal foundations of financial control differ, and so does the way in which the two auditors complete their audits.
For this reason, the two authorities each produced separate national reports on their audit results.
This report takes into account the results of the two parallel audits.
The cooperation ends with the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge as far as possible in 2005.
Later, they agreed to postpone the date until the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as the contractor of the construction project.
Germany is contributing 42.13% to the construction of the bridge.
Initially, the RMD provided for a reinforced concrete structure for the border bridge.
However, in 1999, the RMD agreed with its German partner on the construction of a steel composite structure.
They justified this decision with the possible reduction in the number of pairs of pillars from seven to five and the associated environmental benefits for the valley.
In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had identified the steel composite construction as the more cost-effective solution.
However, this was due to a calculation error.
The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite structure of only 397 m,
In fact, it is 5% longer.
During the tendering process, the RMD made serious errors,
By insufficiently preparing the award documents and inaccurately describing both valuation criteria and subcriteria.
These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the evaluation committee and the director general of the RMD.
A defeated bidder challenged the outcome of the tendering process.
The ensuing investigation by the Czech antitrust office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.
As a result, the following summer construction season was lost in 2004 and the total construction time available was reduced.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter period of time, which led to a significant price increase.
Among the measures offered were the double installation of the superstructures, the change in the shape of the pillar and the construction of an assembly hall.
In addition, the contractor was unable to obtain the original steel grade.
The new type of steel - whose higher costs of around €4 million were borne by the client alone - made it possible to shorten the construction time required for corrosion protection and thus the overall construction time.
Compared to the offer price of around €18.3 million net, the acceleration measures and further submissions will significantly increase the total construction costs of the border bridge.
The shortened construction time alone led to a price increase of around €5.9 million.
The cost is currently around €25.9 million net (as of October 2006).
Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels
Both auditors examined bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges, which were characterised by particularly high prices and to compare bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.
The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.
The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4, as there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.
In preparing this part of the test, a precise definition of the concept of price was important.
For the comparison of bridge prices, both auditors agreed on detailed specifications, for example: To use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.
(VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and can change), not to take into account the cost of special start-up measures, to use the European Central Bank rate of 30.12.2005 for currency conversion (29 CZK = 1 €).
Bridges of different types (reinforced concrete, reinforced concrete, steel composite and steel) and different sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.
In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge constructions, the bridges were grouped according to their design.
The analyses also took into account the bridge size within these groups.
Concrete bridges were by far the most common on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the application of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.
The study showed that the m ² price of concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the size of the bridge (length, road surface): The larger the bridge, the lower the square metre price.
In the case of German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than in the case of Czech bridges (see figures below).
There were two bridges on the A 17, and four bridges on the D 8, with a significantly higher price.
These bridges were determined partly by a method of detecting significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (atypically expensive bridges can be identified on the basis of the distance to the regression curve).
However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as a clue as to which bridges to focus on.
In order to draw definitive conclusions, the causes of the respective high price have to be determined on a case-by-case basis.
This could be due, for example, to uneconomic management, but also to environmental protection requirements or other legitimate reasons.
Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German ones (see table 1), the proven negative correlation between the price of the bridge and the length suggested that Czech concrete bridges are cheaper.
In addition, the lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany spoke for this.
However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
At joint meetings, two reasons for this were identified:
1.
In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mostly awarded separately.
This also allows medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.
In the Czech Republic, many bridge constructions are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.
Orders of this magnitude cannot be handled by medium-sized companies.
2.
In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge constructions built is greater than in Germany.
In this context, the NKÚ noted that the construction of bridges will be determined long before construction begins.
This was already the case when the RMD submitted its application for planning.
At this point in time, it chooses a specific bridge construction variant from a number of alternatives, but profitability plays a minor role in this decision.
Only by means of a thorough analysis of the construction industries of both countries would a final conclusion have been possible with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany, but this would have blown up the scope of this review.
The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.
However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.
The significant price differences may be the result of too little developed competition for tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow for generalising conclusions.
Efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden - Prague motorway
The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.
In the same year, the government approved the plan to expand the motorway network.
The plan was for the gradual expansion of the D8 from Prague to the state border with Germany.
The section 0805 was to be built through the Bohemian Central Mountains in front of the border section 0807.
The Czech Republic finances the D8 under the programme's financing.
The programme number 327 220 "Construction of the motorway D 8 Prague - Ústí nad Labem - Czech-German border" defines two objectives:
1.
As a national objective: To improve the connection between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;
2.
As an international destination: The connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.
The programme provided for the completion of the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains in June 2008 and the construction of the border section 0807 in June 2007.
It should be noted that the end of construction work is not identical to the time of commissioning.
The NKÚ noted that the planning decision had already been taken for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains.
Environmental groups have appealed against the decision.
A final verdict is yet to be handed down.
Compared to the timetable set out in the programme documentation, it was therefore impossible to rule out a delay of several years in the completion of the section Nr.0805.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed a postponement of the completion date of the construction phase Nr.0805 to 2010.
As a result, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national objective of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
The RMD conducted an economic analysis of the borderline section No. 0807 of the D 8 and the section Nr.0805 through the Bohemian Central Mountains in the years 1999 to 2001.
The investment cost was around €639 million for both sections 0805 and 0807.
Table 2: Results of the Economic Impact Assessment (EIRR)
Variant Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the borderline section was 18,000 cars per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the borderline section of 22,000 cars per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the borderline section was 25,000 cars per day in 2010.
The economic feasibility study from 2001 was based on the assumption that the borderline section and the section leading through the Bohemian Middle-Mountains would simultaneously go under traffic.
At the time of the test, it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Central Mountains would not be opened at the original date.
This reduces the aforementioned EIRR values.
The cost of both sections as of 31 December 2005 was €897 million excluding VAT, 27.4% higher than in the 2001 economic outlook.
In addition, there is a risk that section 0805 will have a different, more elaborate route, which would affect the profitability of the project.
The economic analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway was economically justified with a daily traffic volume of at least 18,000 cars per day in 2010. The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22,940 cars per day.
However, a study on diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Central Bohemian Mountains is based on a traffic volume of 12,600 to 13,750 cars per day in 2007, which is then below the economic efficiency limit.
A higher volume of traffic on the routes, which are to replace the missing section with the Bohemian Central Mountains, is highly likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic analysis.
The aforementioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the border section of the D 8 will not be achieved.
The construction of the borderline section of the D 8 is therefore uneconomical.
There were also cost increases in the construction of the A 17, as in the construction of the two above-mentioned sections of the D 8.
In the context of the overall economic assessment for the Federal Transport Traffic Plan 1992, the Federal Ministry responsible for transport assumed investment costs of around €320 million.
As a result, it identified a benefit / cost ratio of 4.6.
In the meantime, the cost has increased to around €670 million and the benefit / cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.
Regardless of the parallel tests with the NKÚ, the BRH had examined the cost-effectiveness of the planning and construction of the A17 motorway between 2003 and 2005.
In doing so, he noted that the authority responsible for approving the project called for an unneeded landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17.
In the course of the audit, the BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the Road Construction Administration of the overflow of the landscape tunnel.
As a result, €10 million in construction costs and €150,000 in annual operating costs could be avoided.
When examining the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction work was inadequately prepared.
The following example illustrates this:
During the planning phase, the road construction administration did not allow the rock to be recorded on the surface of the Dölzschener Wand, as it was difficult to access.
Only when the tunnel propulsion reached the wall did it catch up.
It turned out that the rock was more weathered than expected during the tender process.
Elaborate measures such as anchorages, injections and stone impact protection nets for around €3.3 million were necessary.
In addition to the cost of additional services, which are already required, such as securing the Dölzschener Wand, the road construction administration also paid for those that would not have been required to prepare the building properly.
These include expenses due to disrupted construction processes (€3.2 million), additional training of the propulsion team (€0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the extension of construction time (€7 million).
This additional expenditure of around €10.7 million does not represent any lasting added value.
The BRH took these and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to take better account of the specialist supervision it has in place for major road construction measures.
In this context, it should be urgent for the road authorities to introduce quality assurance systems.
Benefits of cooperation for BRH and NKÚ The cooperation met the expectations of both auditors.
The BRH received insights into the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.
Both auditors have developed a database of bridge and tunnel prices that will help with future audits.
The NKÚ found that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and carriageways of the D 8 are not different from those of the A 17.
The auditors of both auditors involved in the cooperation gathered valuable experience, which will be useful in future audits.

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief for Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
However, against Mainz, the factor of time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area,"said the head of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, the Königsblau still managed to finish the close 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first win of the season.
In fact, things could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf had given the 11th team of head coach Domenico Tedesco certainty, Tedesco said: "Overall, the first half was good, both in terms of play and in terms of pressing," the head obviously played more and more of a role as the game went on.
Schöpf is not really a headball monster.
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and so they kept pulling back.
And defended against Mainz with man and mouse.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his head ball hit: "I'm actually the worst head ball player in the team."
But in the end, the only thing that counts is victory.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including, of course, at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the early stages and make a firework of it," said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle matches over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry about.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the bar 59th / 72nd or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a treble," said Tedesco: "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
So I'm glad we won.
