Welsh AMs worried about 'looking like muppets'
There is consternation among some AMs at a suggestion their title should change to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are worried it could invite ridicule.
One Labour AM said his group was concerned "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means daft and pwp means poo.
A Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not happy" and has suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open minded" about the name change, but noted it was a short verbal hop from MWP to Muppet.
In this context The Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what Assembly Members are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which found broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament.
On the matter of the AMs' title, the Commission favoured Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation.
AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.

Macedonians go to polls in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up in a bid to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will disregard the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.

The Bells of St. Martin's Fall Silent as Churches in Harlem Struggle
"Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there's neither."
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People socialize in a different way" nowadays, he said.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people go on a regular basis."
As for churches, he worries that the money from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect it to, "and sooner or later they'll be right back where they started."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining sanctuaries.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will hasten the day that these churches close altogether because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been worshiping nearby took title to the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild, they commissioned the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has played out at St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the parish's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would seek to pass along the costs" to the vestry, even though the vestry had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent in.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the diocese's part.

Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was diving for lobster in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddled over with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster, but then he "realized that he was yelling, 'I got bit!
I got bit!'
His whole clavicle was ripped open," Hammel said he noticed once he got to the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added the victim sustained traumatic injuries to his upper torso area.
Officials shut down beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.

Sainsbury's plans push into UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is taking on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles staffed with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial push into the UK's Â£2.8bn beauty market, which is continuing to grow while fashion and homeware sales fall back, the larger beauty aisles will be tested out in 11 stores around the country and taken to more stores next year if it proves a success.
The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets hunt for ways to use up shelf space once sued for TVs, microwaves and homeware.
Sainsbury's said it would be doubling the size of its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week while a second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist's stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for Â£125m, three years ago.
It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the alluring environment and convenient locations mean we're now a compelling beauty destination which challenges the old way of shopping."

Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of Â£11million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left 'furious' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulls out of Â£11million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The pair's business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning presenter, 37, took to Instagram to announce she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons" Den star Peter Jones fuming by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own new bumper contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when TV's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to Â£1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated Â£11 million fortune.
As Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, Jones jetted out of Britain to head for one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far the top of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be her long-term future that would see her through the next couple of decades.
Her decision to pull out left everyone involved absolutely stunned.
Nobody could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow HQ which are ready to be sold."
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is among Britain's most bankable stars, could cost the firm millions due to hefty investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and the potential for further delays to its launch.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother-of-three Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples holiday together and Jones has a 40 per cent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We wouldn't comment on his business affairs."

Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his mock "news anchor" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly Saturday that the North doesn't see a "corresponding response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping up pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - ending rocket tests, helping free hostages and getting the remains of American servicemen returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing at the crowd directly in front of him.

Indonesia Tsunami and Quake Devastate an Island, Killing Hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for instance, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been dislocated, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've been very clear that they're not requesting international assistance, so it's a bit challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the national disaster agency spokesman, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given the earth shaking that Indonesia constantly endures, the country remains woefully underprepared for nature's wrath.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though a warning had been in effect, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At the best of times, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's tattered infrastructure a centerpiece of his election campaign, and he has lavished money on roads and railways.
But funding shortfalls have plagued Mr. Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands dislocated from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battled on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other crude weapons.

Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge dips deep equalizer vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while about 30 yards out from the Chelsea goal with his team trailing 1-0.
He tapped the ball to his left before scooping a shot toward the far post.
The attempt sailed high above the box as it drifted toward the right top corner of the net.
The ball eventually dropped over a leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and took one touch and didn't think about it too much and just took the shot on."
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after getting a score in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker heeled a pass back to Mateo Kovacic on that play, before spinning off near midfield and sprinting into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic did a quick give-and-go at midfield.
He then fired a beautiful through ball, leading Hazard into the box.
Hazard outran the defense and finished into the far post netting with a left footed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.

Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after woman is stabbed to death

Its banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.

Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure who many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a wholly accurate representation is the subject of continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."

Killer Pig Mauls Chinese Farmer to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a sty at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a hoggery on May 30, 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The following morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to a neighbouring pig sty open.
He said that in the sty was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550 pound hog had mauled the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mangled," the cousin, referred to by his surname "Wu," said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Though rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years previously, a 650 pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.

Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Follow-up Audit Report
Foreword
Taxes in general constitute the key source of public revenues.
It therefore goes without saying that Supreme Audit Institutions (hereinafter âSAIsâ) should place focus on that audit area.
Value added tax (hereinafter âVATâ) fraud is an example.
It causes an estimated loss of some EUR 100 billion in the European Union (hereinafter âEUâ) each year.
Already in 2005 during the VI. EUROSAI Congress in Bonn the participants outlined the need for working together very closely.
In so doing the SAIs would be able to share audit approaches etc. and find out best practices.
VAT is an audit area which is very suitable for tax audit cooperation because it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter âCzech SAIâ) and the Federal Court of Auditors - Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter âGerman SAIâ) conducted a first ever parallel audit in the field of VAT in 2006.
The report was published in 2008.
As it is known that VAT fraud is a phenomenon not limited to a single country but spread throughout the EU close cooperation amongst the SAIs is needed to ensure comprehensive evaluation of the steps taken to address this problem.
The two SAIs decided therefore to pursue their cooperative efforts in this field and conducted a second parallel audit.
1. Introduction
Audit number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of audit: (CZ) Administration of value added tax (D) Bilateral audit with the NKÃ (follow-up audit)
Objective of audit:
(CZ) The audit objective was to review the procedure used by financial authorities in administrating VAT and the procedure used to address selected cases of business transactions between the Czech Republic and Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter âGermanyâ) and to review the procedures used by the tax administrations of the two countries as part of international cooperation.
(D) On the one hand, the audit was designed to evaluate the steps taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations made by the SAIs.
On the other hand, other fields linked with VAT were to be covered.
The resulting audit findings were to be compared and best practices identified (if any).
The audit period covered the years 2006 through 2008 including relevant information dating from the time preceding the audit up to the time of audit conclusion.
2. Summary of findings and evaluation of parallel audits
The follow-up audit of the administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and in Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.
During previous parallel audits, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were detected.
Some of them merited further review.
On the basis of audit findings the two SAIs produced recommendations on VAT management.
The follow-up audit was conducted to evaluate the action taken in response to these recommendations and to review the suspicious cases selected.
The audit also covered other topics such as the selected cases of high risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance for the recovery of claims and the VAT audit of large tax entities.
When auditing VAT administration in selected areas in the two countries, auditors developed the following audit findings:
1. Recommendations from the previous audit
â¢ Recommendation 1: Conditions for registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU
By comparing the systems of registration for VAT in the two countries auditors found discrepancies in the previous parallel audits.
Since the different ways of registration caused problems, the SAIs recommended harmonising the conditions for registration of taxpayers within the EU.
This issue was taken up at EU level.
The draft of the amended Council (EC) Regulation No. 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No. 218/92 (hereinafter the âCouncil (EC) Regulation No. 1798/2003â) had proposed to expand the current databases within EU, including a database of the tax identification numbers of the VAT payers.
It also provided for common standards for registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
The SAIs expected Member States to agree on adequate standards supporting their decision to keep unreliable traders as early as possible out of the VAT system.
However, the latest version of this document being subject of political agreement among Member States within ECOFIN does no longer cover those issues mentioned before.
The two SAIs regret, that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
They still consider this idea relevant to combat VAT fraud preventively.
â¢ Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of recapitulative statements
As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly submission of recapitulative statements in order to enable earlier reviewing of the values of intra-Community transactions.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common VAT system to combat tax evasion associated with intra-Community transactions has reduced the time limit for submission of recapitulative statements of intra-Community transactions to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this issue was implemented by the amended VAT Act effective as of 1 January 2010, in Germany it was implemented as from 1 July 2010.
Germany had not implemented the obligation for submitting recapitulative statements monthly on schedule, whereas the Czech Republic was in line with applicable EU guidelines.
â¢ Recommendation 3: Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to reach a higher reliability of VIES data and considering the merger of the two procedures for VAT returns and recapitulative statements
The German tax administration accepted the recommendation of the German SAI and established a working group to explore possible solutions.
The work is still under way and the German SAI will closely monitor further developments.
â¢ Recommendation 4: Sharing good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level In earlier audit work, the two SAIs concurred that an effective risk management system could not be developed by one Member State only.
Good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system have to be shared and implemented in each EU Member State.
If not so, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
We found that the two Member States used differing risk management systems that have its strengths and weaknesses.
In this field, the Czech SAI audited the system of exchange of information within EU - EUROCANET and the German SAI focused on German participation in the âPlatform on Risk Managementâ.
2. Follow-up audit of selected intra-Community transaction cases
During the earlier audit, a joint review was performed on business transactions where doubts existed as to their realisation or discrepancies in the method used by the taxpayers of the two countries to report the business transactions in the VAT returns or recapitulative statements.
The two SAIs selected nine cases for the follow-up audit that included intraCommunity movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Inspections carried out by the tax offices of the respective countries had not been finished at the conclusion of our previous joint audit.
The follow-up audit verified that most of the tax proceedings relating to the selected cases of business transactions between the taxpayers into/from the Czech Republic were concluded and adequate measures were taken by the tax administrations in the Czech Republic or in Germany (i. a. additional VAT assessments or prevention of reimbursement of input tax).
3. Audit of selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions
We selected high-risk cases of intra-Community transactions made by EU taxpayers presented in EUROCANET.
The EUROCANET system is a tool for the detection of high-risk taxpayers within EU.
The Member States can participate in the system on a facultative basis.
The Czech Republic is an active participant of EUROCANET, whereas Germany has a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States are opposed to active participation.
Given the fact that the German tax administration took no part in data exchange in the EUROCANET system, no information could be obtained what suppliers with German VAT ID were assessed as high-risk cases.
The Czech SAI found that cases including normal business transactions were identified during the audit as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel trading and fraudulent activities related to VAT.
The tax administrators have limited possibilities for inspecting high-risk transactions, concerning in particular âmissing tradersâ, while a physical review of the documents alone can hardly serve to prove any fraudulent activity to the tax entity.
The same applies to tax administrators, when import from and export to third countries are additionally combined with intra-Community carousel trading.
In these cases, it would be recommendable to provide for increased mutual cooperation between the customs and tax authorities aimed at identifying goods and irregularities with transportation documents as well as monitoring their physical movements within the EU in direction to the final consumer.
Germany as well as a number of other countries were reluctant to actively join the EUROCANET system due to the nonexistence of a sufficient legal basis.
In Germany, other tools for the detection of risk taxpayers are used that have proven to be suitable for the German tax administration so far.
In this area, there is a need for communication and sharing experiences among all EU Member States.
The EU Council reached political agreement on the draft regulation, which recasts Council (EC) Regulation No. 1798/2003.
Its main innovation is the creation of EUROFISC.
The experiences gathered so far with EUROCANET should become part of the envisaged network for fighting against VAT fraud.
4. Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims
In the area of international assistance for the recovery of claims all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislative arrangements.
Therefore the handling of requests for international assistance for the recovery of claims is the same in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The German and the Czech SAI compared the statistics that the two Member States had sent to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
The statistics contained inconsistencies.
The SAIs considered it useful to discuss again the statistics at EU level with a view on how to avoid the inconsistencies still persisting.
Otherwise statistics are not reliable and comparable.
Moreover, the SAIs are of the opinion that reliable statistics should contain more information concerning VAT.
It may be useful for the Commission to provide for an analysis - based on more detailed statistics - to help Member States to enhance effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.
The two SAIs consider it helpful for Member States with a low rate to increase their efforts to reach at least the average recovery rate of the EU.
If a Member State so desires, the Commission should take an active part in this process.
5. VAT audit of large tax entities
The SAIs analysed the legal situation concerning the VAT audit of large tax entities in the two countries.
Additionally, they gathered information from the tax administrations in a questionnaire concerning areas that they considered essential for managing this issue.
Based on the replies received, it has become obvious that the situation in the two countries is diverging.
The Czech Republic has a system for steering the selection of risk prone cases which is based on a large number of relevant data (i. a. information from conducted VAT audits, data from the balance sheets and profit and loss accounts etc.).
This ensures an effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.
The establishment of a specialised tax office for the administration of large tax entities is planned for 2012.
In Germany, a similar system does not yet exist which makes it more difficult to manage and analyse VAT control in general.
Germany is still more focused on the selection of respective individual cases especially based on data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.
The analysis of those data is supported by different risk management components which are going to be enhanced.
3. Audit procedure
3.1 Audit procedure in the Czech Republic
The audit was performed in the period from May 2009 to February 2010 by Division II - Department of State Budget Incomes and by the territorial departments IX Pilsen, X ÄeskÃ© BudÄjovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava.
The audited entities were: the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter âCzech Ministry of Financeâ) and 25 tax offices: tax office Brno II, tax office Brno III, tax office Brno IV, tax office in BÅeclav, tax office in DomaÅ¾lice, tax office in HodonÃ­n, tax office in Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ©, tax office in Cheb, tax office in Jablonec nad Nisou, tax office in Karlovy Vary, tax office in Kralupy nad Vltavou, tax office in Kraslice, tax office Ostrava I, tax office Ostrava III, tax office in PÃ­sek, tax office in Pilsen, tax office for Prague 1, tax office for Prague 4, tax office for Prague 8, tax office in RakovnÃ­k, tax office in Sokolov, tax office in TÃ¡bor, tax office in VysokÃ© MÃ½to, tax office in ZlÃ­n and tax office in Å½amberk.

3.2 Audit procedure in Germany
The audit was conducted from February 2009 to February 2010 by the audit unit for indirect taxes and staff of the assigned regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
After selecting the case examples a number of federal states were notified of the audit mission.
Apart from interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, the audit took place in the following federal states: â¢ Bavaria, â¢ Hamburg, â¢ Hesse, â¢ North Rhine-Westphalia, â¢ Saxony.
Tax files of the following tax offices were included: â¢ Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt MÃ¼nchen, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; â¢ Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg fÃ¼r GroÃunternehmen; â¢ Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; â¢ Essen-NordOst, Essen fÃ¼r GroÃ- und KonzernbetriebsprÃ¼fung, LÃ¼denscheid; â¢ Chemnitz-SÃ¼d. â¢ Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; â¢ Essen-NordOst (Essen-severovÃ½chod), Essen fÃ¼r GroÃ- und KonzernbetriebsprÃ¼fung (Essen - kontrolnÃ­ ÃºÅad pro VDS a koncerny), LÃ¼denscheid; â¢ Chemnitz-SÃ¼d (Chemnitz-jih).
Additionally, discussions were held with the tax offices Muhlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Sud and with the financial directorates in Frankfurt/Main, Chemnitz and Muenster.
The audit findings were reported to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation of the two Supreme Audit Institutions
To prepare for the parallel audits, representatives of the two audit institutions met in September 2008, to discuss and determine the audit topics.
After that in December 2008, the two SAI heads signed the agreement on cooperation in conducting the parallel audit.
At a meeting held in Bonn in June 2009, the audit teams informed each other on initial results developed during the preparation of the audit, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed upon further action.
A second meeting was held in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.
The audit teams shared the findings gathered by then and agreed upon the timetable for preparing the joint report.
The two SAIs decided to examine the following matters in their parallel audit mission: â¢ follow-up on the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report, â¢ review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were not resolved during the previous parallel audit, â¢ review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were classified as high-risk cases, â¢ audit of the tax administrations' procedure in the field of international assistance for the recovery of VAT claims, â¢ VAT audits of large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel audits was drawn up during the working meeting in June 2010.
4. Audit of administration of VAT in selected areas
4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from the previous audit
4.1.1 Evaluation of the recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Conditions for registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU
Based on the the previous audit results, the Czech SAI recommended adjusting the requirements of VAT payer registration and introducing new rules for cancelling the VAT payer registration in the Czech Republic.
The adjusted requirements should more effectively reduce the risk of potential VAT evasions.
In certain cases, it was found out that tax offices failed to apply their authorisation to cancel the VAT registration for the VAT payers who failed to fulfil their obligations arising from Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax (hereinafter âVAT Actâ).
So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not drafted any amended provisions to introduce an obligation for the tax administrators to cancel the registration for a VAT payer in the event of a repeated failure to submit a VAT return.
According to the VAT Act the tax administrator can cancel the registration of a tax payer âex officioâ, if: a) The taxpayer did not perform any transactions without notification of the reason for this to the tax administrator for a period of 12 consecutive months, b) The taxpayer failed to fulfil his/her obligations pursuant to the VAT Act, c) The taxpayer ceases to be a person obliged to pay taxes.
As revealed by the previous audit, the current legislation enabled the tax office for Prague 1 to cancel the VAT registration as at 31 January of the following calendar year of the ânonresident taxpayersâ who incurred no liability during the current calendar year to report and pay tax.
The tax office for Prague 1 frequently did not cancel VAT registrations for those taxpayers, since the respective provision did not lay down a sufficient time limit for cancelling the registration.
The problem was remedied by the amended VAT Act effective from 1 January 2009.
The tax administrator is authorised to cancel the registration of a non-resident tax payer, if he has found out that this tax payer has not supplied any taxable goods or services or tax exempt goods and services with a claim to deduct input VAT in the previous calendar year.
Recommendation 2
Monthly submission of recapitulative statements
As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended introducing monthly submissions of recapitulative statements.
The council directive that reduced the period for submissions of recapitulative statements to one month was implemented in the Czech Republic by the VAT Act, which took effect as of 1 January 2010.
A new obligation to submit the recapitulative statements in electronic format was developed.
Taxpayers have to submit their recapitulative statements also in the event of supplies of services, which are subject to determination of their place of transaction under Â§ 9 (1) of VAT Act, to another Member State to a person registered for VAT in another Member State, provided that the recipient is obliged to report and pay VAT on those services.
The foregoing obligation ensues from Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services.
Recommendation 3
Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements to reach a higher reliability of VIES data This recommendation related to the German tax administration.
The Czech administration matches data of intra-Community transactions from VAT returns and recapitulative statements of Czech taxpayers automatically in the system ATIS.
Recommendation 4
Sharing good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level
The proper collection of VAT is an indispensable prerequisite for adequate functioning of the EU internal market.
Combating VAT fraud is therefore included among the priority interest areas and has been paid considerable attention to in recent years.
The importance of this fight has been evidenced inter alia by the conclusions of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, in which an external evaluator attempted to calculate the difference between the due and actually collected VAT amounts in 25 Member States during the period 2000-2006.
Based on an analysis of the available data, the evaluator arrived at the conclusion that the estimated loss amount of uncollected VAT for that period totalled from EUR 90 to 113 billion, while EU-25 fails to collect 12 % of due VAT on average each year.
The loss incurred on VAT by the Czech Republic in 2006 was estimated even at 18 %.
The previous audit noted, as part of international cooperation, that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State only.
Successful criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system have to be exchanged and implemented in each Member State of the EU.
Concerning the risk management system the Czech SAI audited the system of exchange of information within EU -EUROCANET.
Cases of risky intra-Community transactions carried out by taxpayers from EU presented in EUROCANET were selected for the audit (see chapter 4.3).
The objectives of improved administrative cooperation and enhanced effectiveness of combating VAT fraud should be achieved also through establishing the EUROFISC network, meant to assist improving cooperation of the responsible authorities to a level enabling disclosure of fraud already at an early stage.
Later on, the network should become a resource for assessing risk exposures in intra-Community transactions.
ECOFIN approved establishment of the EUROFISC network already on 7 October 20089 and stipulated the key principles to govern the network at the same time.
A model for EUROFISC can be seen in EUROCANET, the system already operative for the swift and selective exchange of information developed by the Belgian tax authorities in cooperation with the other Member States and with support from the European Commission and OLAF.
The objective of the system is to detect risky business transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Evaluation of the recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report resulted in the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Conditions for registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU
The tax administration in Germany established a well functioning system for the registration of taxpayers that is based on a detailed questionnaire.
The Federal Ministry of Finance brought this system to the attention of the Commission in October 2007.
The system itself is being improved continuously.
The data of the questionnaire are now being recorded electronically and will subsequently be available for research so that the data are part of risk management during registration.
The Commission made a proposal to amend Regulation 1798/2003. This proposal included common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
The Member States needed further explanation and detailed elaboration of these issues.
The German SAI requested the Federal Ministry of Finance to make sure that Germany will not go below the standards achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly submission of recapitulative statements
On April 8, 2010 a law was adopted for the implementation of EU directives into national law.
The law includes provisions regarding the monthly submission of recapitulative statements for intra-Community supplies.
The provisions take effect as of 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements to reach a higher reliability of VIES data and in this context considering the merger of the two procedures for VAT returns and recapitulative statements
A joint working group with staff from the federal states and the Federal Ministry of Finance had been established.
The group elaborated a strategy for the automatic matching of data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.
The strategy is still under discussion with the federal states.
Additionally, this working group also dealt with a tool to optimise the control procedure for the internal market transactions.
Recommendation 4
Sharing of good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level Relevant information is exchanged at EU level.
Germany takes part in this exchange at âPlatform on Risk Managementâ.
The European Commission supported the idea of such a platform and following a written consultation of 18 October 2006, the establishment of the platform on risk management was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan.
The members of the platform split into sub-groups which dealt with topics such as: â¢ Risk tools, â¢ Influencing behaviour, â¢ Evaluation, â¢ Updating the risk management guide.
New reports of the sub-groups were published at the beginning of 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The issue of requirements for registering and cancelling a VAT registration in different countries was addressed at EU level.
The draft of the amended Council Regulation No. 1798/2003 had proposed to expand the current databases within EU, including a database of the tax identification numbers of VAT payers.
It also provided for common minimum standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
The issues of registration and cancellation of registration have been so far left to the national legislations of the EU Member States.
The Member States needed further explanation and detailed elaboration of these issues.
The German SAI requested the Federal Ministry of Finance to make sure that Germany has not to go below the standards already achieved.
On 8 June 2010 the ECOFIN reached political agreement on the above-mentioned draft regulation.
The idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
Member States have to implement national procedures and only have to inform the Committee on Administrative Cooperation of these procedures.
The SAIs regret that the Commission did not succeed in convincing Member States of the necessity of common standards for registration and deregistration of taxpayers as they consider this an important element in the preventive fight against VAT fraud.
They therefore would appreciate further efforts of the Commission in this direction.
Monthly submission of recapitulative statements
As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly submission of recapitulative statements in order to enable earlier reviewing of the amounts of the intraCommunity transactions.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions has reduced the interval for submission of recapitulative statements on intra-Community transactions to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this issue was implemented by the amended VAT Act effective 1 January 2010. In Germany it was implemented as of 1 July 2010.
Germany had not implemented the obligation for submitting monthly recapitulative statements on schedule, whereas the Czech Republic was in line with the EU directives.
Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to reach a higher reliability of VIES data and in this context considering the merger of the two procedures for VAT returns and recapitulative statements
The German tax administration accepted the recommendation of the German SAI and established a working group to explore possible solutions.
The work is still under way and the German SAI will closely monitor further developments.
Sharing of good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level
Germany and the Czech Republic use different risk management system approaches to identify risk-prone traders.
The Czech SAI audited the system of information exchange within EU - EUROCANET (see chapter 4. 3).
In this field the German SAI focused on German participation in the Platform on Risk Management.
4.2 Follow-up audit of selected intraCommunity transaction cases
During the previous audit, a joint review of business transactions was performed where doubts existed as to their realisation or discrepancies in the method used by the taxpayers of the two countries to report the business transactions in the VAT returns or recapitulative statements.
The two audit institutions selected nine cases for the follow-up audit that include intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany, the audit of which carried out by the tax offices of respective countries had not been finished at the time of our previous joint audit.
1)
A Czech taxpayer acquired goods at the value of EUR 22,686 from a German taxpayer in the 1st quarter of 2005.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of the goods in his VAT return as the German taxpayer had no VAT ID assigned in the said period, only a tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
Based on international administrative cooperation in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, the Czech tax administrator received information that a taxpayer supplying goods to other Member States was not required by the German VAT Act to be assigned a VAT ID ensuring that intra-Community supplies of goods are exempt from VAT.
A follow-up audit by the Czech SAI revealed that based on an audit carried out by the Czech tax administrator, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return, in which he declared the goods acquisition in the above amount and simultaneously exercised the right to a tax deduction in the same amount in the VAT return.
2)
A Czech taxpayer allegedly acquired goods worth of EUR 12,561 from a German taxpayer in the 4th quarter of 2004.
The Czech taxpayer stated he did not acquire the goods and he did not declare it in his VAT return.
The German tax administration refused cooperation upon request, invoking Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 as the turnover on the transactions did not exceed the value of EUR 15,000.
As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain any evidence, he concluded his audit without any findings and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.
A follow-up audit by the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech tax administrator received two pieces of spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, showing that the German taxpayer billed the said goods to Slovakia.
The Czech taxpayer acquired the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and stated the acquisition in his regular VAT return for the month of October 2004.
3)
A Czech taxpayer allegedly acquired a passenger car worth EUR 48,500 from a German taxpayer in the 4th quarter of 2004.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of the goods.
The same taxpayer did not submit any VAT returns as from August 2004. Therefore the tax administrator assessed VAT at CZK 0 for the said quarter.
Based on information obtained from Germany under international exchange of information according to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, the tax administrator called upon the taxpayer in March 2007 to submit an additional VAT return, which the taxpayer however failed to do.
A follow-up audit revealed that the tax administrator performed further acts in the tax proceedings in 2007 that showed that the respective passenger car was sold by the taxpayer to a secondhand car dealer in the Czech Republic.
The Czech tax administrator issued a tax assessment for the taxation period of December 2004 VAT on the acquisition of goods from another Member State and on their resale was additionally assessed in the amount of CZK 295,379.
Based on the ruling of a Regional Court, the Czech taxpayer was dissolved with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.
In the absence of any sizable assets of the tax debtor, the above arrears appear uncollectible.
4)
A Czech taxpayer allegedly supplied new means of transport (passenger cars) to Germany in the total value of EUR 198,167 in the 4th quarter of 2004 and in the 1st quarter of 2005.
The response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 indicated that there have been criminal proceedings for a tax offence pending against the German entity in Germany.
A follow-up audit of the German SAI revealed that proof was obtained after conclusion of the tax proceedings in Germany to the effect that the German taxpayer was involved in fraudulent activities.
The intra-Community acquisition of the goods was taxed at EUR 182,424 (for 2004) and EUR 369,690 (for 2005).
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI established that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel trading in new means of transport.
Based on information obtained from the German tax administration with regard to a review of the supply of goods, a VAT audit of the Czech tax entity was commenced for the taxation periods of April, May and June 2005.
Based on the audit findings and information obtained from international exchange of information, the tax administrator assessed additional VAT of CZK 703,031 for May 2005 and of CZK 726,551 for June 2005.
5)
Czech taxpayer A allegedly acquired a machine in the total value of EUR 58,000 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
The foregoing German taxpayer allegedly supplied a machine at the value of EUR 88,027 to Czech taxpayer B in the 3rd quarter of 2004, while taxpayer B denied the acquisition.
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that taxpayer B acquired the machine from a German company that had an organisational unit established in the Czech Republic.
Czech taxpayer A did not declare the acquisition of the goods from the German taxpayer in his VAT return.
The response by the German tax administrator to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 indicated that the German taxpayer did not perform any intra-Community supply of a machine in the value of EUR 58,000 but performed a supply of goods within the Czech Republic.
A follow-up audit of the German SAI revealed that, subsequent to a completed tax audit, the intra-Community supply of the machine was reclassified as a domestic supply of the machine and the VAT exemption was cancelled.
6)
A German taxpayer allegedly supplied goods in the value of EUR 11,600 to a Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.
The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech tax administrator assessed an additionally submitted VAT return that contained an unauthorised declaration of acquisition of goods from another Member State that included also the acquisition of the goods in the above value.
The German SAI found out that the German tax administrator, upon receipt of a response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, corrected the German taxpayer's VAT return and additionally assessed VAT of EUR 1,600.
Further movements of the goods in Germany and application of VAT in Germany are subject of a tax audit.
The German taxpayer's recapitulative statement has not been corrected as yet as any recapitulative statement adjustments may be carried out only by the taxpayer who has submitted the recapitulative statement.
7)
The Czech tax administrator received a request for information from the German tax administration in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, inquiring whether or not a Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car in the value of EUR 47,400 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
After conduct of an audit for the taxation period of February 2005, the Czech tax administrator assessed the tax liability at CZK 0 for the Czech taxpayer and notified the German tax administrator that he was unable to confirm the car acquisition by the Czech taxpayer.
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that the registration of the Czech VAT payer was cancelled in 2007 on grounds of non-compliance with obligations and the Czech tax administrator referred the supporting documents to the Czech Police.
A follow-up audit by the German SAI revealed that the German taxpayer moved his registered office and that, based on a performed audit the new competent local tax administrator cancelled the VAT exemption for the supply of the said car to the Czech taxpayer.
The German taxpayer has not so far corrected the data in his recapitulative statement and he has filed an appeal against the tax administrator's decision.
8)
According to the data in the VIES system, a German taxpayer supplied goods in the total value of EUR 33,205 to a Czech taxpayer in the period from the 3rd quarter 2004 to 1st quarter 2005.
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech tax administrator was investigating the reasons of the differences that occurred with the Czech taxpayer at the acquisition of the goods during the period from the 3rd quarter 2004 to 1st quarter 2005.
The Czech taxpayer repeatedly submitted an additional VAT return for the 1st quarter of 2005.
The Czech tax administrator did not explain the difference in the value of the acquired goods of CZK 134,273 during the period from the 3rd quarter 2004 to 1st quarter 2005 because, according to the Czech tax administrator, business transactions for separate quarters could not be precisely traced and the tax administrator therefore accepted the submitted VAT returns.
9)
A German taxpayer supplied goods worth EUR 46,854 to a Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared an intra-Community acquisition of goods only in the value of EUR 14,856.
The Czech tax administrator reviewed the amount of the performed supplies as part of international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003.
Attached to the response to the request for information delivered from Germany were three invoices stating the total value of the goods supply at EUR 31,998, which is an amount corresponding to the difference of the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer in the VAT return and VIES system data.
A follow-up audit by the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech taxpayer, following repeated reminders by the tax administrator, submitted an additional VAT return in January 2007 for the taxation period of July 2004.
In the said VAT return, the taxpayer at the same time exercised his VAT deduction right and the tax liability for the respective taxation period remained unchanged as a result of that.
The follow-up audit verified that most of the tax proceedings relating to the selected cases of business transactions between the taxpayers in Germany and the Czech Republic were concluded and adequate measures were taken by the tax administrations in the Czech Republic or in Germany (i. a. additional VAT assessments or prevention of reimbursement of input tax).
4.3 Audit of selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions
4.3.1 Audit findings in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be a major source of information for detecting risky entities within a Member State where the goods were acquired.
In the Czech Republic, the early-warning information obtained from the EUROCANET system is compared with the acquirers' data by the competent local tax offices.
Since the 1st quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic has been sending information to the EUROCANET system on risky transactions and tax entities acting as suppliers.
Nine Czech tax entities being part of the EUROCANET were selected for the audit.
They acted either as supplier to or as acquirer from the tax entities.
Relevant data was captured in the EUROCANET system by the tax administrations of other Member States.
Given the fact that the German tax administration took no part in data exchange in the EUROCANET system, no information could be obtained with the help of it whether or not suppliers with a German VAT ID have been assessed as risky entities by the German tax administration.
The audit revealed cases which included normal business transactions as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel trading and other fraudulent activities related to VAT.
In the respective cases, tax administrators share information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003.
For example:
â¢ The tax administrators did not detect any suspected involvement in risky transactions during the verification of the early-warning information.
Tax offices continuously monitor the tax entity for the reason of being involved in the EUROCANET system.
â¢ The tax offices did not succeed in proving deviations from the rules for calculating the tax base and VAT from the presented accounting records during the verification of risky transaction, even though tax offices found out discrepancies in transportation and warehousing of goods or detected business relationships with suspicious and non-contactable companies from the other Member States.
â¢ The verification of business transactions was complicated, because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with the tax administrator and could not be contacted.
Competent local tax offices mostly reviewed the risky tax entities and risky transactions set out in early-warning information from the EUROCANET system.
The tax administrators have only limited possibilities to review risky transactions concerning particularly those of so-called âmissing tradersâ, because an inspection of the documents alone can hardly serve to prove any fraudulent activity of the tax entity.
Stricter requirements for registering taxpayers for VAT and more flexible cancellations of the registration would assist in reducing missing trader fraud.
On behalf of the tax entities involved in carousel trading and other fraudulent activities, registrations for VAT are made for the purpose of reporting EU-wide fictitious supplies of goods or issuing formally accurate tax documents to the taxpayers who then make unauthorised deductions of input VAT.
In case of suspicion that tax entities are involved in carousel trading and other fraudulent activities in connection with imports from and exports to third countries, it would be recommendable to provide for increased mutual cooperation between the customs and tax authorities.
This would help to identify goods and irregularities with transportation documents as well as monitor their physical movements within the EU in direction to the final consumer.
The Member States can participate in the system on an optional basis.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in the operation of the EUROCANET system was considered as a weakness of the system by the European Parliament at the end of 200814, which should be remedied by establishing a compulsory EUROFISC network.
4.3.2 Audit findings in Germany
The German SAI analysed data available in the Federal Central Tax Office with EUROCANET data included.
These data served as basis to select six German taxpayers' files for review.
Germany as well as some other countries refused to actively join EUROCANET.
Therefore, Germany has a passive status which means that it does not send data to Brussels but is only a recipient of EUROCANET data.
The justification for doing so is that âin the view of the government it is legally not allowed that state (governmental) institutions submit data to EUROCANET.
Currently there is no legal basis in place that would permit to break applicable tax secrecy provisions.
Additionally, the government has no reliable information on how those data are used within EUROCANET by the other Member States.â15 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has analysed the EUROCANET data and has submitted them to the tax authorities of the federal states according to a procedure agreed between them.
The German tax offices receive control information about the direct business relations of a taxpayer registered in the specific tax office with a trader from another EU Member State which was entered into EUROCANET.
However, the German tax office does not receive any information on whether the trader of the aforementioned other EU Member State had risky business relations with traders in other Member States which also did business with the respective German trader.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The Czech Republic is an active participant of EUROCANET, whereas Germany has a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to become an active member.
Consequently, the audit in this field had to be conducted in different ways.
Nevertheless, the results did not reveal great differences with regard to detecting VAT fraud cases. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one tool in a risk management system.
The tax administrations of both countries have a number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to create a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the EU reached political agreement on a draft regulation whose main innovation is the creation of EUROFISC.
The experiences gathered so far with EUROCANET should become part of the envisaged network for fighting VAT fraud.
Member States should therefore communicate their experiences at European level.
On the other hand, the cases brought before courts of law nationally and at European level revealed that a discussion between the Member States and the Commission about the conditions for the tax exemption of intra-Community transactions seems to be necessary.
4.4 Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims
4.4.1 International assistance for the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
The core legislation on international cooperation in recovery of certain financial claims within the EU comprises the following directives without limitation:
â¢ Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, and on the agricultural levies and custom duties;
â¢ Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, and on the agricultural levies and customs duties and in respect of value added tax and certain excise duties;
â¢ Commission Directive 2002/94/EC laying down detailed rules for implementing certain provisions of Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
Council Directive 76/308/EEC was implemented in the Czech Republic by Act No. 252/2000 Coll., on international assistance for the recovery of certain financial claims.
Following adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, the Directive had to be implemented into the Czech system of law and the foregoing act had to be amended at the same time.
New Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on international assistance for the recovery of certain financial claims (hereinafter âAct No. 191/2004 Coll.â), was adopted in this connection.
A new relevant legal provision has recently been put into place by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008.
Annexes to the Regulation set out new models of the application forms in use as from 1 January 2009, and the Regulation newly stipulated the obligation of electronic communication and obligation of the applicant authority to certify the conformity of any sent documents with their originals.
Key principles of providing international cooperation in recovery of claims are:
1. reciprocita (vzÃ¡jemnost);
2. assistance is always provided only upon request and where all requirements are fulfilled;
3. assistance shall not include any financial claims that are described as a sanction of a criminal nature in the requested state;
4. the procedure at providing international assistance for the recovery of claims must abide by the national laws of the requested state;
5. foreign claims shall have no priority over domestic claims in the recovery process;
6. assistance is provided only to recover indisputable claims;
7. exhaustion principle: the applicant state has exhausted all available means of recovery of the claim enabled by its system of law.
Act No. 191/2004 Coll., specifies three forms of giving assistance: provision of information; delivery of instruments; and recovery of claims in particular.
Procedure of sending requests for recovery to other EU Member States
A competent local tax office shall electronically transfer the request for information, request for notification or request for recovery of claims together with respective documents, to the Czech Ministry of Finance through the financial directorates.
The Czech Ministry of Finance shall provide for translating the request into the respective language, shall scan it including its attachments and, through the CCN/CSI network, and shall send it to the respective tax administration authority of the specified state.
Two basic requirements have been imposed with respect to the recovery - the claim shall exceed EUR 1,500 and shall not be older than 5 years.
The requested authority may refuse the claim recovery, if the requirements have not been met.
Procedure of receiving requests for recovery from other EU Member States
Where requests from another Member State are received, the Czech Ministry of Finance must forthwith acknowledge receipt of the request as soon as possible upon receiving it, however within seven days at the latest.
If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides it is not going to admit the request, it shall notify the applicant authority of the reasons for rejecting the request and shall set out concrete provisions of the Directive which it relies on.
Such notification should be sent no later than within three months of the date of acknowledgement of the receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the request, the Czech Ministry of Finance shall verify if the request meets all legal requirements. After that, the Czech Ministry of Finance shall transfer the request through a financial directorate to the competent local tax office for processing.
In the event the request for recovery is accepted, the tax administrator shall i. a. identify the debtor's assets, e. g. through the extracts from the Cadastre of Real Estate, identification of bank accounts, registrations of motor vehicles with the Traffic Inspectorate etc.
When six months have elapsed from the date of the request receipt acknowledgement, the Czech Ministry of Finance should notify the applicant authority of the outcome of the investigation that has been undertaken in order to obtain the requested information.
The applicant authority should also be informed in the event that the tax entities in question cannot be contacted and the claim can therefore not be recovered.
Any amount successfully recovered by the tax administrator shall be transferred to the applicant authority within one month from the date on which such claim was recovered.
The Czech tax administrator making efforts to recover foreign claims may use an option to allow a moratorium on the payment of the claim or its payment by instalments, providing the applicant state gives its consent to that.
The interest or penalty charge is assessed to the debtor for the recovery period in accordance with Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on administration of taxes and fees.
Such interest or penal charges shall pertain to the state that has requested the recovery.
Concerning received requests for recovery, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit the requests to the competent tax administrators in time, particularly during 2006 and 2007.
A similar situation was identified with respect to the requests for international assistance for the recovery of the claims received from the tax administrators in the Czech Republic.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with the Act on the international assistance for the recovery of claims because it failed to notify a competent authority of the Member State of the progress made with the recovery within the six months time period from the day when the receipt of the request was acknowledged.
The situation has improved since 2008.
Statistical data
The Czech Ministry of Finance prepares statistical data for the European Commission in accordance with Â§ 13 (4) of Act No. 191/2004 Coll., by 15 March each year, setting out the number of information, notification and recovery requests sent and/or received in the previous year, the amount of the claims involved and the amounts recovered according to the year of request to which they relate.
Based on the supporting data provided by all Member States, the European Commission reports the Council and the European Parliament on the use of the provisions on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance understated its statistical data by EUR 5,250,000 due to an error in the item of claims recovered in 2008, as a result of an incorrectly stated amount of the VAT claim subject to recovery (the error consisted in a shifted decimal marker when translating the CZK amount of the claims into its EUR equivalent).
The error subsequently was reflected in the European Commission statistics.
Information on the mutual assistance with recoveries is set out in the table below.
4.4.2 International assistance for the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal authority for international administrative assistance in tax matters derives from European Community law, Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) and Commission Regulation of 28 November 2008 (EC implementing Directive).
For the sake of better readability and clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codifies Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197619, whose provisions have been amended substantially several times.
The provisions apply i. a. to the recovery of VAT and of taxes on income and capital including the related interest charges and penalties.
The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into domestic German law by the Collection of State Taxes (EC) Act of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is governed by the German Fiscal Code.
Article 117.2 of the Code points out, that tax authorities may provide international judicial and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal instruments of the European Communities that are applicable within the national jurisdiction and of the EC Administrative Assistance Act.
Part six of the German Fiscal Code (Articles 249-346), embodies the legal provisions governing enforcement procedure.
The administrative operations of the tax authorities are governed especially by the Execution Instruction and the Enforcement Instruction.
The Federal Ministry of Finance reached agreement with the representatives of the supreme tax authorities of the federal states (Laender) on the principles of administrative assistance with tax assessment and transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.
General preconditions for submitting requests for recovery are:
â¢ Legal prerequisites have to be fulfilled (Â§Â§ 251, 254 German Fiscal Code (AO)).
â¢ All available domestic means of recovery have been exhausted.
â¢ The claims for which recovery assistance is requested have to be definitive.
â¢ The period between the issuing of the enforcement order or the date when the claim becomes final (is no longer subject to appeal) and the date of the request may not exceed 5 years.
â¢ The total amount of the claim shall exceed EUR 1,500.
Procedure of sending requests for recovery to other EU Member States
German requests for recovery of delinquent tax liabilities are sent from the execution units of the tax offices to the relevant foreign authority as for instance the Czech CLO via the intermediate authority and the Federal Central Tax Office.
Details are governed by the Guidance on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Recovery) of 19 January 2004.23 This Guidance is currently being revised by a Federal Government/Laender working group and adapted to the new Recovery Directive.
The request together with the attachments is submitted electronically by the tax office to the intermediate authority.
This authority checks whether it is correct in terms of content and form.
If not, the request is returned to the respective tax office.
Otherwise the request is submitted to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Central Tax Office will then provide for the necessary communication with the respective foreign authority, including the translation of the request.
Procedure of receiving requests for recovery from other EU Member States
Requests for recovery received from other Member States are being registered in the Federal Central Tax Office and an acknowledgement of receipt is sent out within 10 days.
Additionally, the Federal Central Tax Office checks whether the formal requirements are met.
In principle the Federal Central Tax Office submits these requests to the intermediate authority, which in turn submits them to the respective tax office and monitors execution.
The Federal Central Tax Office also sends interim and/or final reports.
If the handling of a request takes more than 6 months, it will remind the intermediate authority of the interim report that is required according to the article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/EG.
After having checked the formal and factual preconditions of a request, the execution units announce enforcement measures.
Any amount recovered has to be transferred to the bank account given in the request within one month after receipt.
Statistical data
Information on the mutual assistance for the recovery of claims between Germany and the Czech Republic for 2006-2008 (as of 31 December 2008).
4.4.3 Audit of recovery requests, case studies
A total of 21 requests for international assistance for the recovery of claims between the Czech Republic and Germany were selected for the audit as part of international cooperation.
A review of ten selected cases revealed, without limitation:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for the recovery of a claim to VAT for the years 2004 and 2005, totalling EUR 3,883 = CZK 109,820, concerning a Czech tax entity.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request for recovery to the tax administrator as late as on 26 February 2008.
In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech tax administrator established a security interest in real estate owned by the Czech tax entity.
Since the pledged property alone was not sufficient to satisfy the total claim to be recovered, payment by instalments of at least CZK 2,000 monthly was agreed with the Czech tax entity.
On 31 August 2009, information on the claim recovery progress was sent to the German tax administration, noting that the claim was partly recovered in the amount of CZK 49,600 through the instalments as of 25 August 2009.
The said amount was remitted to Germany and, on 28 August 2008, another instalment of CZK 3,000 was sent to Germany.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity owing in Germany the amount of EUR 180,869 = CZK 4,434,915 of VAT, income tax and interest and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the tax administrator as late as on 27 November 2008.
The tax administrator, based on a review of ownership of bank accounts, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and movable assets established that the debtor owned no distrainable assets.
An investigation on site further revealed that the debtor had not been present at his permanent domicile address for more than a year.
His whereabouts in the Czech Republic are unknown.
This notification was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009, while the tax administrator sent its response to the German tax administration on 16 April 2009.
3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery from Germany on 21 November 2007, concerning the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity totalling EUR 3,139 = CZK 84,846 in VAT plus interest and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the recovery request as late as on 6 August 2008, although the Czech Ministry of Finance meanwhile received a notification from Germany on 18 February 2008 that the Czech tax entity already had settled the claim in Germany.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance notified the tax administrator that this recovery case had been closed because the claim had been paid by the Czech tax entity in Germany.
The said claim, however, was paid also in the Czech Republic under the recovery process and credited to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Given the long time taken by the Czech Ministry of Finance to inform the authorised tax administrator, the claim was paid twice - by the entity itself in Germany and once again through the claim recovery by the Czech tax administrator.
In cooperation with the German SAI, it was ascertained that the recovered amount will be offset against a claim under another recovery request totalling EUR 6,649 and intended for sending to the Czech Republic in September 2008.
With respect to the company in question, the Czech Ministry of Finance records show only a request for claim recovery at EUR 3,139 while the request for recovering the claim of EUR 6,649 was not in the Czech Ministry of Finance records.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for recovery of the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity owing in Germany the amount of EUR 39,957 = CZK 956,654 of income tax and VAT, interest and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the Czech tax administrator on 19 December 2008.
On 1 June 2009, a procedure for claim recovery was started; an order for the distraint of the bank accounts in the Czech Republic and for the attachment of wages in the amount of CZK 7,000 was issued.
During the negotiations with the tax administrator, the debtor stated that he disagreed with the amount of the claim and considered it disputable.
According to the Czech tax administrator, the tax entity was previously willing to pay EUR 250 monthly, which was, however, not accepted by the German tax administrator.
The tax entity promised to discuss its application with the German tax administrator, with an aim to reach a changed amount of the claim.
The claim recovery process still continued during the Czech SAI's audit.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery from Germany concerning a Czech tax entity owing the total of EUR 113,444 = CZK 3,116,304 of income tax for 2005 and VAT for the years 2003-2007, interest and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to tax office for Prague 1, which is authorised to administer taxes of the non-resident tax entities in the Czech Republic, as late as on 14 November 2008, since the competent local tax administrator could not be determined based on the available address of the tax entity.
The tax office obtained information during the performed investigation that the debtor has an income of EUR 4,704 on 19 September 2008, for which the tax office has been however unable to issue an execution order as the request for the claim recovery was transferred to the tax office after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech tax administrator commenced the claim recovery process and issued an execution order to secure the claim against the debtor's cash held in the accounts kept with banks and credit unions.
The claim recovery process still continued during the Czech SAI's audit.
6.
On 3 October 2006, the Czech tax administrator requested international cooperation for the recovery of a claim for VAT and cost of proceedings, totalling CZK 146,223,742.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request for recovery to the German tax administration as late as on 13 May 2008.
On 8 September 2008, the German tax administrator transferred the amount obtained through the seizure of the funds on the debtor's account at the amount of EUR 17,700 = CZK 439,226 through Bundesbank to the Czech authorities.
On reviewing the amounts of the recovered claims, an error in translation of the amount subject to recovery was identified.
The recovered amount of CZK 146,223,742 was translated at the rate EUR 1 = CZK 25.065, however with an error resulting in an amount of EUR 583,378.
The correct translation of the amount subject to recovery is EUR 5,833,782.
The request for recovery sent to Germany was lower by EUR 5,250,404 as a result of that.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance for the recovery of the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity owing the total of CZK 1,970,632 = EUR 79,847 of VAT, interest and charges.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the tax administration in Germany as late as on 10 November 2008.
On 4 February 2009, the German tax administrator called upon the debtor to pay the arrears.
In view of considerable drops in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and in the first half of 2009 in particular and given the related liquidity situation of the company, the following payments were made to repay the arrears: on 8 April 2009 -EUR 4,600; on 6 May 2009 - EUR 3,000; and, on 16 June 2009 - EUR 2,500.
The payments were credited to the tax administrator's account in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, the German tax administrator reached an agreement with the debtor that the latter would pay another instalment of EUR 2,500 by 30 June 2009.
8.
A request for recovery of the claim totalling EUR 398,653 = CZK 9,832,779 and including also a claim for property transfer tax was delivered by the Czech tax administrator to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 22 May 2008.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery to the German tax administration on 2 October 2008.
On 3 April 2009, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a notification from the German tax administration that the request was returned by the German tax administration.
The German tax administration justified the return by explaining that the property transfer tax did not constitute a tax as per Art. 2(e)(f)(g) and (h) of Directive 2008/55/EC.
The German tax administration further added that Art. 2(g) applied to the claims relating to income tax and taxes on assets.
Accordingly, Art. 3 of Directive 2008/55/EC applies to income and asset taxes not listed in Art. 1(3) in combination with paragraph (4) of Council Directive 77/799/EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to prepare and submit a new recovery request excluding the property transfer tax arrears at the amount of CZK 61,759, while setting out the arrears for VAT, corporate income tax and individual income tax, and to resend the request to the German tax administration.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the Czech tax administrator for the recovery of the tax arrears relating to the same tax entity which owed the amount of CZK 7,079,735 of the liable income tax and VAT.
9.
On 6 February 2006, the Czech tax administrator sent a recovery request to the Czech Ministry of Finance with respect to the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity owing the total of CZK 3,445,782 = EUR 123,328 of individual income tax and VAT.
The aggregate amount of VAT was CZK 1,133,967.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the tax administration in Germany as late as on 18 April 2007.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded a response by the German tax administration of 9 July 2007 to the Czech tax administrator as late as on 11 November 2008.
The response stated that the German tax administrator issued an execution order for the bank account with a bank on 11 June 2007, however was advised by the bank the debtor had no business relationship with the tax entity.
As a result, the German tax administration considered the case closed.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the Czech tax administrator dispatched a request for recovery to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning VAT arrears totalling CZK 1,296,845 = EUR 43,591.
The request by the Czech tax administrator was delivered to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the German tax administration on 15 December 2005.
Prior to dispatching the request for recovery, the Czech tax administrator distrained funds of the debtor in a bank account, obtained an attachment of wages and established a security interest in real property.
The recovery request was preceded by a request for information sent to the German tax administrator on 16 March 2005.
According to the response to the request for information received by the Czech tax administrator on 16 September 2005, the Czech tax entity was resident in Germany and had an income of EUR 8,437 from a non-business activity.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a response to the request for recovery on 20 April 2006 and passed it on to the Czech tax administrator as late as on 12 February 2008.
The response stated that no recovery proceedings could be instituted in Germany due to the debtor's insolvency, that no assets of the debtor were identified and that his income from non-business activities had been already a subject of other execution proceedings.
As a result, the German tax administration deemed the request for recovery complied with.
4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation
In the area of international assistance for the recovery of claims, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislative arrangements.
The procedures for handling requests for international assistance with the recovery of claims are similar in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The German and the Czech SAI compared the statistics that the two Member States had sent to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
The statistics contained inconsistencies.
In its report of 2006, the European Commission recommended that the Member States needed to take greater care in establishing their statistics.
In its report from 2009 the Commission concluded that the discrepancies in the statistics had decreased although the number of requests had increased.
The two SAIs considered it useful to discuss the matter of statistics again at EU level.
Discussion should focus on how to avoid the inconsistencies that still persist. Otherwise statistics are not reliable and comparable.
Moreover the two SAIs are of the opinion that reliable statistics should disclose the annual number of requests as well as the nature of claims concerned (VAT, income tax etc.) and amounts of the claims recovered per Member State.
The two SAIs consider it useful that the Commission provides for a more detailed analysis of the statistics submitted by the Member States, because this may help the Member States to assess their own effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.
As the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the two SAIs consider it helpful that Member States with a low rate should increase their efforts to reach at least the average recovery rate of the EU.
If a Member State so desires, the Commission should take an active part in this process.
Concerning the requests for recovery received, the Czech Ministry of Finance submitted the requests to the competent tax administrators with delay in particular during 2006 and 2007.
A similar situation was identified with respect to the requests for international assistance for the recovery of the claims received from the tax administrators in the Czech Republic.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with the Act No. 191/2004 Coll. for the international assistance for the recovery of claims, because it failed to notify a competent authority of the Member State of the progress of the recovery efforts within the six months time period from the day of acknowledgement of receiving the request.
4.5 VAT audit of large tax entities
4.5.1 VAT audit of large tax entities in the Czech Republic
VÅ¡eobecnÃ© informace
SprÃ¡va DPH u VDS byla zajiÅ¡Å¥ovÃ¡na obdobnÄ jako u ostatnÃ­ch daÅovÃ½ch subjektÅ¯.
The procedure for the large tax entity audit is based on Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on administration of taxes and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance defined large tax entities as natural or legal persons founded or established for the purpose of doing business and whose net turnover for the taxation period declared in their individual or corporate income tax return amounted to CZK 2 bn and more.
Classification of a tax entity as large tax entity was carried out following its income tax return submission for the respective taxation period, and for 2003 for the first time.
The tax entity ceased to be classified as an large tax entity in the event that its net turnover for the taxation period dropped below the above mentioned limit during three successive taxation periods counted from the end of the period for which the entity submitted its tax return based on which it was then classified under large tax entity.
No tax entity could be removed from the large tax entities' records without a tax audit of at least one tax type for at least one period being performed before.
All large tax entities were audited at least every five years until the end of 2009.
Since 2010, a written evaluation of the tax entity needs to be performed at least once every 2 years, while the selected follow-up procedure has to eliminate tax risks and their negative implications for the accurate assessment and collection of taxes.
The audits shall focus on at least one tax type, while, as a rule, the tax administrator selects several tax periods for a single exercise.
The large tax entities were audited by staff of the specialised audit departments - established at 13 tax offices in total -or audit departments of the competent local tax offices.
A specialised audit department carries out tax audits within its local competence area as determined by the director of the financial directorate.
KromÄ kontroly VDS kontroluje tÃ©Å¾:
â¢ tax entities engaged in uncommon and specific business fields,
â¢ entities whose tax audits involve special expertise and time demands,
â¢ entities with an intricate territorial and organisational structure,
â¢ entities suspected of large-scale tax evasions,
â¢ entities that are members of chains and networks, where suspicions exist of large-scale tax evasions and of unjustifiable excessive deductions.
The number of tax audits performed by the specialised audit departments of tax offices and their results are set out in Table No. 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to amend the Act No. 531/1990 Coll., on territorial financial authorities, specifically by establishing a specialised tax office with the nation-wide competence for the selected tax entities (i. a. for legal persons incorporated for the purpose of doing business and having a turnover of more than CZK 2 bn).
4.5.2 VAT audit of large tax entities in Germany
ObecnÃ© informace
VAT audits of large companies are governed by the same rules as tax audits in general, i. e. the relevant provisions are laid down in â¢ the German Fiscal Code (AO), â¢ the Fiscal Administration Act (FVG), and â¢ tax audit regulations (BpO).
Additional documents for guidance are in place.
German Fiscal Code
The legal provisions provided for in articles 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in âSection IV - tax field auditâ: in particular, these articles embody the rules for the admissibility of a tax field audit (audit on the premises of an enterprise), its scope as to subject matter, rules on allocation of responsibilities, the form and content of audit notification, audit principles, the taxable person's duties to cooperate and the prerequisites for holding final discussions and communicating the audit report.
Tax field audits are carried out by the responsible tax offices (Article 195 of the Code).
Fiscal Administrative Act According to Article 5.1 item 1 in connection with Art. 19 of the Act, the participation in tax field audits carried out by tax offices is incumbent on the Federal Central Tax Office.
The nature and scope of the participation of the Federal Central Tax Office in tax field audits are agreed between the authorities involved.
Moreover the Federal Central Tax Office is entitled to demand that specific enterprises it has named are audited at a time it has specified.
In this case it may promulgate rules for the conduct and contents of audits on the premises of these companies.
Tax Audit Regulations Pursuant to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the Tax Audit Regulations (German abbreviation: BpO 2000) were promulgated with the consent of the Bundesrat (the upper chamber of the German Parliament on which the Lander governments are represented).
The administrative regulations applied to tax field work of Lander tax authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.
Enterprises are classified according to size at regular intervals pursuant to Article 3 of the Regulations.
Large enterprises are to be subjected to a follow-up audit (Article 4.2 of the Regulations).
Article 33.1 of the Regulations, each cognisant tax authority has to keep a register of groups of companies being also defined in the Regulations.
Administrative guidance
In addition, the following documents provide additional guidance for the tax administration:
â¢ Uniform Manual for special VAT audits in Germany;
â¢ USLO Manual, which provides guidance on the use of the data on intra-Community business relations held on VIES;
â¢ working aids for different and special subjects.
â¢ ZAUBER Manual, which provides guidance on the use of the database ZAUBER;
The classification of tax entities is based on criteria like turnover and net income with different thresholds according to the line of business.
The figures are made public by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
They are evaluated every three years and fixed for the following three years.
The number of businesses - not only large businesses - has to be ascertained at regular audit intervals (latest interval: 1st January 2010).
In general, large businesses have to be audited continuously.
The audits are generally announced including VAT.
That means: during the audit timeframe especially income tax or corporation tax, trade tax, and VAT - all kinds of relevant taxes - have to be audited finally.
VAT audits can be carried either by tax auditors or by VAT auditors.
This varies and depends on the organisational structure in the federal states.
The number of taxation periods covered by an audit varies regularly between 3 and 5 years.
The BpO 2000 assumes an audit period of 3 years.
All taxes a company was assessed for are subject to review.
4.5.3 Management of audits of large tax entities
As both SAIs decided not to review individual cases they focused on management questions to get a picture on how the tax administrations handle the issue of VAT audits of large tax entities.
Based on a questionnaire, they gathered information from the tax administrations concerning areas that they considered essential for managing this issue.
â¢ What statistical records and analyses concerning the VAT audit of large businesses are available to the management of the tax administration?
In particular:
â¢ Are there any statistics or records about the extent to which a distinction is drawn between fighting VAT fraud and general VAT inspection?
The Czech Republic: No, system ATIS in current data version does not allow drawing this difference.
Germany: The tax administration does not differentiate between an audit designed to combat VAT fraud and a general VAT inspection.
â¢ Are there any statistics or records about the timeliness of VAT audits (in relation to the time of the transactions audited)?
The Czech Republic: Records about the timeliness of enquiries relevant to intra-Community acquisition of goods of selected VAT taxpayers are shown in system ATIS.
Additionally, such information as how long did the enquiries take is also part of the data recorded in ATIS.
Germany: No, the unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors only contain information on the average last audit period (year).
This is a figure that does not provide an overview of the selected audit periods with respect to individual entrepreneurs.
VAT auditors focus on the latest VAT assessment periods and are also entitled to audit large tax entities.
But the statistics on federal level for special VAT auditors does not provide information concerning the classification of tax entities.
â¢ Are there any statistics or records about the nature of the additionally generated VAT revenues; divided e.g. according to the following features:
i. genuine increase in tax liability (e. g. application of a reduced tax rate instead of the standard VAT rate)
ii. only nominal increase in tax liability (e. g. shift of a full-compliance VAT case to a different taxable period)
iii. additional tax revenue collected (payment of the outstanding additional tax due)
The Czech Republic:
The Czech tax administration monitors the numbers of tax verifications performed, levels of additional tax assessment broken down by types of tax, by the number of audited tax subjects and by the number of controlled taxable periods.
Other tax procedures (local investigation, reproach procedure) are monitored in the same way.
As an independent task, data and the amount of additionally paid taxes are recorded.
Statistics of general debts broken down by types of tax but not according to declared tax or tax found out by a tax administrator are also kept.
Germany: No, the unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not distinguish between the above mentioned criteria.
Moreover most of the tax administrations visited do not make such a distinction either.
â¢ Are audit fields that yield high additional revenues recorded?
The Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administrator is in a position to select taxpayers for verification on the basis of criteria which can be linked with chosen indicators in special parts of ATIS.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal government level (Bund).
Subsequently the unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not provide such information.
But there is one coordinated approach of the ministries of finance of the âLanderâ and the âBundâ.
In the ZAUBER data base, tax auditors or tax investigators of the federal states (Lander) have to register their assessed increase in VAT liability if it exceeds a certain amount.
In this case, they have to specify e. g. the nature of the assessed increase in VAT liability.
â¢ What are the most frequent findings?
The Czech Republic:
- large tax entities exercised an unauthorised right to deduct input VAT for supplies and services,
â¢ that were not used to perform any economic activity as per Â§ 72 (1) of the VAT Act;
â¢ that were used for any entertainment purposes as per Â§ 75 (3) of the VAT Act;
â¢ based on tax documents that did not meet the requirements as laid down in Â§ 73 (1) of the VAT Act;
- large tax entities did not declare output VAT as per Â§ 21 (1) of the VAT Act.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal government level (Bund).
Subsequently the unified statistics at federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not provide such information.
Findings in respect to VAT are not separately recorded by the federal states (Lander) as far as they result from tax audits of large companies.
But in the ZAUBER database in which tax auditors or tax investigators of the federal states (Lander) have to register their assessed increase in VAT liability exceeding a certain amount, the Federal Central Tax Office is able to analyse such information.
â¢ Does the tax administration analyse audit fields that produce a high âyield' and does it draw the consequences for the management?
The Czech Republic: Yes, for example they launch national audit proceedings aimed at risky commodities or a subject of economic activity.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal government level (Bund).
The unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not provide information about audit fields that produce a high âyield'.
There are diverse opinions on the process of analysing as well as of managing cases under the aspect of materiality.
Some regional tax offices provide special information; but the tax offices are free to make use of them.
4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation
The different answers of both Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects a lot of information including information about conducted VAT audits as well as data of the balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts.
On the basis of a wide range of information the Czech Republic is able to steer the selection of risk prone cases.
The same applies to analysis and management of VAT control in general.
In the Czech Republic the establishment of a specialised tax office for the administration of large tax entities is planned in 2012.
In Germany, the tax administration does not collect such information.
Subsequently it is more difficult to fulfil these tasks in a similar way.
But nevertheless Germany's philosophy places more focus on selecting respective individual cases based on VAT return information submitted.
Therefore risk management components are going to be enhanced and improved.
On the basis of adequate reference notes, well trained tax auditors have to assess the accurate amount of VAT.
The two SAIs are of the opinion that Member States should be able to provide adequate management as well as an adequate risk management system.
This will help reduce VAT shortfalls.
As a result, VAT revenue as well as the risk for unreliable entrepreneurs to be detected will increase.
5. Conclusions
The cooperation of the two SAIs within the parallel audits of the administration of VAT achieved the objectives set by the German and Czech SAI.
The two SAIs developed a deeper understanding of the applicable systems in the Czech Republic and Germany in the fields of: â¢ intra-Community transactions, â¢ risk management of VAT, especially concerning the selection of risk prone transactions, â¢ recovery of VAT claims, and â¢ VAT audits of large tax entities.
Due to mutual cooperation, differences of strategies to detect VAT fraud cases and in the above mentioned areas of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany were revealed.
Audit findings were compared and on their basis best practices were identified.
Furthermore, the SAIs hope that the results achieved may encourage stakeholders to enter into discussions about approaches and strategies within and among Member States as well as with the EU Commission.
The invaluable experience and knowledge gained by cooperation of the two SAIs may serve as an encouragement to conduct future audit missions of VAT administration.

Hurricane Rosa's remnants to bring widespread heavy rain to southwest US
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rains across northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 Hurricane, as of 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move east toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding, debris flows and possibility landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in spots, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Flash flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely ill advised to venture out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain could cause canyons to become raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring locally gusty winds and blowing dust.
The approaching trough will bring some locally heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Rainfall totals of over half an inch are possible, which could cause minor debris flows and slick roadways.
This would be the region's first rainfall of their wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread into the Four Corners on Tuesday and last through Wednesday.
October can see some intense temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a great example of dramatic temperature differences through the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is nearly a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, lingering summer warmth will try to build and expand again.

More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's gripping testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute twist: an agreement engineered by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh groped her drunkenly and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in impassioned testimony, said he's 100 percent certain that it didn't happen.
It's likely that more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.
The company was counting average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures weren't immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices.
To put that in perspective, that's an audience size similar to that for a playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts have strongly backed Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would be voting in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught be CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being shouted at by protesters as he tried to ride an elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with eyes downcast for several minutes as he was berated, televised live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "you have power when so many women are powerless.""
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks were all covering live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the nominee for the next week, which minority Democrats have been urging.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, because it was evident Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.

British PM May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to the one with her on the newspaper's front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack of her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "entirely preposterous."

Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and booked into prison on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to fatally shooting Wayde.
His bond has been set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head into the neck.
The department is crediting the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and area citizens in assisting in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for its "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about at all times," Wade said.

Volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ash spewing from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and it registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center was monitoring multiple rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash coating car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano that sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.

Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police pelted them with eggs and hurled powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that would usually be thronged with tourists.
Scuffles also broke out later in the day with police using their batons to contain the fighting.
Over several hours pro-independence groups chanting "No forgetting, no forgiveness" faced off with unionist protesters shouting, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests, local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters chose overwhelmingly to become independent, though turnout was low with those against secession largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote going ahead at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration went ahead but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we lived through one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy at being able to vote but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite managing a vital if narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to retain momentum this year with many of their best known leaders either in self imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic recording the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial jail since late last year, announced he would run in European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga strike gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Promoted Livingston stunned Rangers to consign Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference as Gary Holt's side moved level with Hibernian in second.
Gerrard's side remain without an away win in the Premiership this season and face leaders Hearts, who they trail by eight points, next Sunday.
Before then, Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston miss chances against blunt visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their directness causing Rangers all manner of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his effort across the face of goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his effort wide after sliding in to meet Craig Halkett's header across goal.
The hosts were content to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could trouble the visitors at set pieces.
And that was the manner in which the crucial goal came.
Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston worked an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining to set up Menga, who took a touch and scored from the centre of the box.
By that stage, Rangers had dominated possession but had found the home defence impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely untroubled,
That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos did force a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow flicked wide from another Livingston set play.
Crosses continually came into the Livingston box and were continually cleared, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were waved away.
'Phenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and personnel has scarcely changed since their return to the top flight, but great credit has to go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, marshalling a superbly-organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
Rangers were short of inspiration, though.
As good as they have been at times under Gerrard, they fell well short of those standards.
Their final ball was lacking - only once did they cut the home side open - and it is something of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in mid-table.

Erdogan get mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at repairing relations beteen the NATO allies.
They've fallen out over issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but plenty of supporters turned out nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The dueling protests reflect the divisiveness of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and reviled as an autocrat by others.

Hurricane Rosa Threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flash Flooding (Drought Areas May Benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy tracks across the Desert Southwest, delivering flash flooding risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct path over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals up to 4 inches possible.
For those out of flash flood risk, Rosa's rain may be a blessing since the region is drought-stricken.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this rainfall will likely be beneficial since the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to landfall across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore powering down.
Thus, it's expected to make landfall in Mexico at tropical storm strength in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall across portions of Mexico could be heavy, posing a significant flooding risk.
"Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then track up through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main hazard expected from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce life-threatening flash flooding and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.

Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered, the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegation.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with a sterling record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President obliquely referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates."

Hundreds killed by Indonesian quake, tsunami, with toll seen rising
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away as giant waves crashed onto beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying anything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before striking the shoreline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in statement the energy released by Friday's massive quake was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two.
The geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and the damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications "were totally crippled with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," it said.
The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water crashes onto the shore, carrying away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending in cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still badly need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.

It Is Very Bad.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala have made it safely to Palu city, where employees are sheltering in tarpaulin shelters set up in the courtyard of their office, they passed scenes of devastation on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw lots of houses that were destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even as aid groups began the grim motions of starting the gears of disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staffing from overseas can only start flowing if the site of a calamity is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not happened yet.
"It's still a province level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can open for international assistance but there's no status yet."
As the second night fell on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing were holding out hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that leaven the bleak story lines of natural disasters.

Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which wrapped up earlier this month in Indonesia.

"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse circulated among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who were taking part in the beach festival.
His messages, though, only resulted in one gray check mark, rather than a pair of blue checks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.

Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show who cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
As well as being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said the word has religious significance for him.

Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never ever use the military to repress the Mexican people."
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration at the plaza on Oct. 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities draws youth to criminal gangs.

U.S. should double A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, even as the U.S. overall lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it's aiming to be No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much farther behind U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard in order to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporates," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the U.S. bolster its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should automatically be offered to PhD's in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations dole out money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is meant to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen action in months.

Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which had blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entrance into NATO and the EU.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not be voting in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubts on whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to pursue admission into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so they can be live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the vote's outcome to make it decisive.
The name change would requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, turnout stood at only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters cast their ballot.
"I came out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their ballot for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that would open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and pulling up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the service door" Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we do have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the huge majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He said that a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful turnout needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first serious blow to policy of the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.

Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through entire Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling dispatched of the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass at midfield at the start of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, before slashing into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one defender before outrunning several more at the edge of the Brighton box.
He then pushed a pass to his left, finding Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We spoke about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.

Scherzer wants to play spoiler vs. Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there wasn't much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched at least a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock up their first division title.

My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely stood up to antisemitism.
In my case, the censure motion criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the Friday night GC meetings have been exactly that.
Sadly today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
It has become increasingly apparent that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there follows a tirade of abuse on social media calling for deselection, denouncing the politics of the centre, telling me I should not be in the Labour party.
And that is not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normalised.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is we are no longer that broad church and with every "no-confidence" motion or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower.
I have had lots of advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so vocal and then I would "be all right."
But that is not what I came into politics to do.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling down, I've sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I would say is that when the country is ploughing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But really the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of deselection threats or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I believe are the best interests of you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr go top
Two late tries may have skewed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully-entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They now top the table, the only unbeaten side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defence, as much as their better chance-taking, which carried the home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"We've been tested over our games this far, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Credit to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to make numbers tell and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted try.
Climo stretched the Ayr lead with a penalty, before, right on half-time, he scored then converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the leeway to five points.
There was then a lengthy hold-up for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was stretchered off, and from the restart, Ayr surged further ahead through a Stafford McDowall try, converted by Climo.
Ayr acting captain Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded, and again, Melrose made the extra man pay with an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a spell of fierce pressure.
The home side came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was yellow-carded for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down at the back of the advancing Ayr maul.
Climo converted, as he did again almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry away for the home side's fifth try.
Still Game star looks set for new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran looks set to move into the hospitality industry after it was discovered he's been named as the director of a licensed restaurants company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final one in the show's run, and it appears Kiernan is planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official record listings, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was looking to get involved in Glasgow's "thriving restaurant trade."

'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to Pacific
Sailors patrol a rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly an ocean-blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are daubed with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty."
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still vivid - as is the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.
Those hopes are perhaps at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is of course expecting with a positive view the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hopeful that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of fitful talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has plenty riding on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favour - and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ's ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates the case "wasn't complicated," said Paz ZÃ¡rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from furthering Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have set it back.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said ZÃ¡rate.
Morales's belligerent rhetoric has sapped any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo RodrÃ­guez VeltzÃ©, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually speedy.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."

North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless it can trust US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow through on promises made during a summit in Singapore between the rivals' leaders.
His comments come as US. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "pipe dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first making significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.

Paris fashion shows reveal latest line in massive headwear on it's way to a High Street near you
If you want to upsize your hat collection or completely block out the sun then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled an array of wacky oversized head gear for their SS19 collection on the runway which dazzled the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-popping creations down the catwalk.
The stand out piece by Valentino was an over-the-top beige hat adorned with a feather-like wide brim that swamped the models heads.
Other over-sized accessories included bejeweled watermelons, a wizard hat and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks- and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn up lips and resembled more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled scuba diving gear complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.

Style watchers predict that the enormous bonnets could be making their way to high streets near you.

The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that was splashed across social media sent another big creation down the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model toting it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringing and topped with a white leather handle, was the stand out piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I'm expecting to see large hats and beach bags arrive on the high street for next summer - as the designer has made such a huge impact it would be hard to ignore the demand for the oversized accessories.'

John Edward: Languages skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavours.
With upwards of 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a bespoke school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages continue as a popular and desired subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language that goes to his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when wanting to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rates within independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a Higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent studying Spanish also achieved an A.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future.
Languages now, as a subject choice, are being held in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage.
Therefore more and more, language skills are becoming imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they've learned a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future having a life-long skill such as this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
This is why putting the investment into language teaching now is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, whereas others will teach languages that are deemed to be most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills required to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It can't be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vitally important to the country's future, so this must be mirrored in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron to make Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is nearly over for fans looking to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But just how many minutes he'll play has yet to be determined.

Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a flurry of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies in the next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on hold for his pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for upcoming mid-term elections since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast on Nov.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which became tense over sexual misconduct allegations with an anticipated Senate confirmation vote on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary aim of this flurry of rallies is helping Republicans facing touch November elections gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said these five rallies in the next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.

Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show stomach for fight to keep hopes alive heading into Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes might just have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept but one that players truly believe in, and never more so than at competitions like these.
So where would they say the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we are carrying that as a little bit of momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he strolled off for the day.
Europe have the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in their sails though and they have plenty to be encouraged by, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boast three points from four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural screams of celebration got louder as his round went on, sinking a crucial putt to take match four all-square when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt that won them the match on 15 was met with a similar scream, the sort that tells you he believes that the American team is not out of this.
"You've really just got to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
It is all each of these players has left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from four and can do no wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this boisterous crowd cements that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
Talk of European glory remains premature, though.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short work of Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never got close to climbing out of.
On Sunday, though, there is nobody to help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between pairings, the advice they give, the advice they don't and the way that a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe have played better as a team thus far and take a significant lead into the final day but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the fight that some, especially Stateside, had been doubting.
How would you like to be in my entourage?

Europe take 10-6 lead into Ryder Cup final day
Europe will take a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after emerging from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their tally so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, bidding to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misfiring American side in the morning fourballs, taking the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but they could not eat into the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then gelled superbly to beat a deflated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not have it al their own way though on a pleasant, breezy day south west of Paris.
Three-times major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They earned a gritty 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes having lost the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit going into the singles, although as holders Furyk's side need only draw to retain the trophy.
After being second-best for two days, however, a Sunday counter-attack looks as though it will be beyond them.

North Korea says 'no way' will disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust in the United States and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri reprised familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first ever summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "denuclearization-first" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting to the "declaration of the end of war,"" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the U.S., the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, heaped praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully, final, verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce him for making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalization of relations with Washington.

Harvard students take course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has got all its undergraduates getting more sleep in a bid to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-fuelled 'all-nighters.'
An academic found students at the world's number one university are often clueless when it comes to the very basics about how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
'At the end of it one girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I only being told this now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The hour long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is impacted by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behaviour instantly.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in 'pulling an all-nighter' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring you have enough sleep, of a good quality, should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, it to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can throw your circadian rhythm out of kilter, leading to problems falling asleep.

Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal downs Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another bout of away-day blues as Dolly Menga's strike consigned Steven Gerrard's disjointed side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted just Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points adrift of runaway Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like levelling.
While Rangers now drop down to sixth spot, Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be further trouble in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 which took a point off Hearts last week and he would have been delighted with the way his well-drilled outfit suffocated their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored just two minutes in when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder tugged his big chance wide.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide at the back post.
Rangers did grab control but there looked to be more hope than belief about their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have had a penalty on the quarter-hour mark as he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's appeals.
Rangers managed just two first-half shots on target but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame Ovie Ejaria strike.
While Livi's 34th-minute opener may have been against the run of play, no one can deny they deserved it for their graft alone.
Again Rangers failed to deal with a deep Jacobs set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher slotted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break as he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch almost provided an immediate impact as the winger slotted in Morelos but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to suck the visitors into playing exactly the type of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood up well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he tangled with Jacobs but again Thomson looked away.

Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and COUNTING ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
A mainstay of science ever since, the Geiger Counter became a pop culture mainstay as well, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado," starring those seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given off by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say, it sure is popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday.

New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' rogue cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' rogue cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognise rogue cells as part of treatment
Method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in lab
They can then 'see' a protein common to many cancers and then reinjected
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise rogue cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukaemia.

Kanye West Embarked on a Pro-Trump Diatribe, Wearing a MAGA Hat, After his SNL Appearance.
It Didn't Go Well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a rambling performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he was wearing a Make America Great cap, he went on a rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white person and they say: "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism I would've moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a skit starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's rant was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to mock West with the posting.
Also, West had complained to the audience that he had got a hard time backstage about his head wear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'don't go out there with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "You wanna see the sunken place?" saying that he would "put my superman cape on, because this means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments drew boos at least twice from the audience and SNL cast members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The entire studio fell dead silent."
West had been brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West got backing from head of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE MOB."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe is embracing and spewing ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the being formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change their name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington hits out at toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has hit out at the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles on screen mean young boys often feel like they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something's gone wrong' and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he feels 'quite strongly' about addressing the issue.
'I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?,' he said.
'What have we been teaching men when they're growing up, in terms of the problem we see now?'
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued: 'What's innate and what's taught?
What is taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes young boys feel they have to be this certain side of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that?
Because clearly something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he wouldn't be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he is 'done with battlefields and horses'.
From November Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on in,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.

HIV/Aids: China reports 14% surge in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens who are living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year-on-year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the issue.
Maxine Waters denies staffer leaked GOP senators' data, blasts 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators onto the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat asserted that the claims were being pedaled by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel's hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters" office and released the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests she doesn't have the temperment to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must be calm and serene."
Fleischer was appearing to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"Big if true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally liable for all of their actions that are destructible and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."

Johnny English Strikes Again review - underpowered Rowan Atkinson spy spoof
It's traditional now to look for Brexit significances in any new film with a British slant and that does seem applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and spluttered back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously rubbish we are be the nation's new export opportunity?
At any rate, the pop-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has had his licence to cock things up renewed for the second time - that name of his signalling more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemagoing territories.
He is of course the daft secret agent who despite his bizarre pretensions to smoothie glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a dollop of that chap contributing a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
He's also originally based on the traveller and international man of mystery Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos in his wake.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest JE outing.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a medieval suit of armour and the rotor blades briefly clanging against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humour feels pretty underpowered and weirdly superfluous, especially as the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humour feels as if it is pitched at kids rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's wacky misadventures aren't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in the persona of Bean.
The perennially topical premise now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and embattled figure, already suffering a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but there's nothing much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that as every single active spy has been compromised, she will have to bring someone out of retirement.
And that means bumbling Johnny English himself, now employed as a schoolmaster in some posh establishment, but giving off-the-record lessons in how to be an undercover operative: some nice gags here, as English offers a School of Rock-type academy of spying.
English is whisked back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, hitched to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of getting things terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer woes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farcical high-jinks: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flash French restaurant; they create mayhem smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he attempts to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are certainly pulled out for that last sequence, but as amiable and boisterous as it is, there's quite a bit of kids' TV about the whole thing.
Pretty moderate stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films I couldn't help thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
I could have left by the window, unnoticed, but I risked being discovered.

Labour denies it is devising a plan for Britons to work a four day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan which will see Britons working a four day week - but getting paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same pay.
Sources said the idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
Shifting to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party pledging a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
The aspiration is currently not being endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole, however.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day working week is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to claw back power from 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' at utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean current shareholders in water companies may not get back their entire stake as a Labour government could make 'deductions' on the grounds of perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand 10 per cent of private-sector firms' equity to employees, who stand to pocket annual dividends of up to Â£500.

Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could sway any Republican senators into pulling their support.
In an interview airing Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republicans Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could unearth anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said going into the hearing, I said, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that allegation came out, said, 'Did you do it?'
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, appears set in stone.
"My mind's made up about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everybody she names couldn't verify it.

What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has it Done Anything to Decrease Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event which has a hugely impressive line-up of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which stated in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feeling like they are making a true difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing for a host of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equating to more than $37 billion that is set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or fundraised.
The group estimates the secured funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 649 million people across the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the U.K. improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "It'll be a long and hard path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle MonÃ¡e are among some of the acts performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.

US could use Navy for "blockade" to hamper Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy hitting the markets, including in the Middle East, US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as cited by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's engagement in Syria - notably, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is they want to broker energy just like they do in eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he has reportedly said.
And, according to to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to make sure the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to blockade, to make sure that their energy does not go to market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group which styles itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, leveraging and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
For that effect, the Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's "captive."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has drawn backlash from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Elizabeth Warren Will Take "Hard Look" At Running For President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "hard look" at running for president following the midterm elections.
During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she'd consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take a hard look at running for president."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall, saying he was "taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I am worried down to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported such a run.
The poll showed more support for a run by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential run and 48 percent against it.
Other high profile Democratic names discussed in regard to a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, the Associated Press reported.

Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on Sept.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through coming back, I can relate to other families who feel ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a bit different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military, has given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence assault on a female, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
The killer didn't just want him dead, but destroyed.

18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions suit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang member sons," abused her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The states' attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a bar violates that principle," the friend-of-the court brief said.
Attorneys further argued in the brief that the policy denying immigrants entry hurts the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.

U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In disseminating its propaganda, China's government is availing itself of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubling economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.

Republicans Alienating Women Voters Ahead of Midterms With Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn
As many top Republicans stand-by and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, analyst have warned they will see a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record already showing they wanted to go forward with a vote.
Those things can't be walked back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to placate angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the hallway of the Senate as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be off the chart," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying it's already been high; that's true.
But it could be higher, particularly among swing women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who while they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
"This has become a muddled mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's just not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be somewhat split over who to believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more siding with the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while just 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought forward by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they attended a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.

Joint Report on Parallel Audits of Expenditure on the Construction of the Motorway Prague â Dresden
Background
Without the trans-European motorway networks the high traffic volumes between the member states in modern, united Europe would be subject to considerable constraints and losses in quality.
High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and raising Europeansâ standard of living.
Putting in place the right conditions for fast, safe, reliable and efficient passenger and freight transport is an important government task.
Performing this task is a highly demanding exercise in organisational, technical and financial terms.
When putting into place and extending a sustainable European transport infrastructure system, decision-makers often have to reach difficult compromises with European and national policy interests, for example, in preserving the environment.
Building transport infrastructure is expensive, especially owing to the environmental protection measures that are required.
Carefully considered action and decision-making by government departments when preparing and procuring transport construction may bring significant savings of public funds that can be channelled into other beneficial uses.
One of the tasks of audit institutions is to identify shortcomings that prevent ensuring the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on the construction of transport infrastructure.
Audit institutions should not merely draw government departmentsâ attention to the shortcomings identified; they should also recommend measures designed to improve the state of affairs, to the benefit of citizens and to the benefit of Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two supreme audit institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Bundesrechnungshof (BRH) and the NejvyÅ¡Å¡Ã­ kontrolnÃ­ ÃºÅad (NKÃ) conducted parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the motorway Prague â Dresden (D 8 motorway in the Czech Republic and the A 17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The motorways are connected by a border bridge co-financed by the two countries.
By working together with the NKÃ, the BRH was able to audit in depth the efficiency of the funds used for building the border bridge.
As a result of working closely with the BRH the NKÃ was furnished for comparative purposes with the necessary data of German cost levels of bridges and tunnels.
In the year 2000 the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a treaty on building a border bridge.
In accordance with the construction progress, the completion date was finally scheduled for the end of 2006.
During the public procurement process, however, the Roads and Motorways Directorate of the Czech Republic (hereinafter âRMDâ) committed errors that led to the tender being prolonged and time for construction shortened.
The contract with the contractor was therefore signed later than envisaged.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time and ensure completion in 2006.
As a result, the RMD had to accept a considerable increase in the price of the bridge.
As part of the joint audit effort motorway bridges on the D 8 and A 17 were compared based on the prices per square metre of area of the bridge structure.
The statistical analysis of prices made it possible to identify bridges that came at a high cost per square metre.
This analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge as compared to other large bridges having a length of over 100 metres.
The price increase could also be attributed to the delays occurred in the tender procedure.
When auditors analysed the costs of tunnel structures they found that the prices of tunnels are considerably higher on the D 8 motorway than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
The BRH and NKÃ now possess a database of prices for bridges and tunnels on which they can rely in future audit missions into the efficiency of the funds used for transport infrastructure purposes.
Concerning the construction of bridges the two audit institutions recommend the following: standardising bridge constructions and using composite steel-concrete and special structures only if prestressed steelconcrete bridges are not adequate.
The main features of the cooperation were teamwork and informality.
Throughout the parallel audit, the auditors shared their specific knowledge and skills.
Introduction
This report informs about the conduct and the results of parallel audit missions regarding the funds spent on the construction of the motorway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and the A 17 in Germany).
The audit missions focused on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure occurred.
The parallel audits were performed by the BRH in Germany and NKÃ in the Czech Republic.
The parallel audit work was conducted in the years 2005 and 2006.
The NKÃ scrutinised the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of approximately CZK 20 billion incl. VAT in expenditure (approx. â¬ 690 million) on the border section of the D 8 motorway, which is numbered 0807.
Out of this amount â¬ 64 million were planned to be used from European funds (ISPA).
Apart from the parallel audit work undertaken conjunctively with the NKÃ the BRH had audited the planning and construction of motorway A 17 in the years 2003 and 2005.
The funds used for building all three sections of the A 17 motorway amounted to some â¬ 670 million, where â¬ 277 million will be co-financed by European funds (EFRE).
The motorway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Dresden â Central Eastern and South Eastern Europe â Istanbul Pan-European Transport Corridor IV.
The D 8 runs from Prague to the state frontier via Usti nad Labem.
The A 17 runs from the Czech/German border to Dresden.
At the time of audit, the frontier sections of both motorways were under construction.
These sections have been opened on December 21, 2006.
While on the German side the motorway is completed up to Dresden, on the Czech side, the D 8 is not completed, because section No. 0805 at a length of 16.4 km through the Central Bohemian Highlands between Rehlovice and ovosice is still in the preparatory phase.
The stretch 0805 between Prague and ÃstÃ­ nad abem is planned to pass through the Protected Countryside Area in the Central Bohemian Highlands.
According to forecasts performed in the Czech Republic in 2001, traffic volume on the border section No. 0807 of the D 8 motorway should be 22 940 vehicles per day in 2008.
According to German forecasts traffic volumes at the Czech border will total some 25 000 vehicles per day in the year 2010.
In the year 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic signed a Treaty on connecting German Motorway A 17 and Czech Motorway D 8 on the common state frontiers by constructing a border bridge.
Since the two states participated in building the bridge; examining the construction of the individual bridge was therefore an important aspect of parallel audit missions by the two audit institutions.
Cooperation between BRH and NKÃ
From mid 2005, the two supreme audit institutions discussed to work closely in auditing the construction of the motorway connecting Prague and Dresden.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1.
Germany co-finances the construction of the border bridge.
Planning and construction are incumbent on the Czech road construction administration.
Therefore, the BRH had no possibility of auditing this construction project itself.
2.
The NKÃ did not have a comparative database needed for assessing whether the funds were used economically regarding the overall cost level of bridges and tunnels on the D 8.
3.
The NKÃ needed to examine the effectiveness of expenditure by looking at the motorwayâs principal technical parameters, and particularly the arrangement of bridges and tunnels that were meant to provide the same level of quality of use on both sides of the border.
After preparatory negotiations, an Agreement on the Coordinated Audit of the D 8/A 17 Motorway was signed on January 4, 2006 by the presidents of the two supreme audit institutions.
Joint working meetings between BRH and NKÃ auditors took place throughout 2006 at roughly six to eight week intervals.
The meetings addressed current problems and tasks, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology for auditing the prices of bridges and tunnels, information exchange regarding findings arising from the audit of the construction of the border bridge and the preparation of joint reports.
A significant feature of the cooperation was the continuous sharing of information.
While the BRH did most of the comparative work on the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and the contracting procedures, the NKÃ prepared most of the methodology for scrutinising the prices of bridges and tunnels.
In accordance with applicable relevant government audit legislation in the two countries, there are differences in the manner of concluding audit missions in Germany and Czech Republic.
For this reason, the two supreme audit institutions drew up each a separate national report on its audit findings produced.
The present report reflects the results achieved in the parallel audit missions.
The cooperation will be ended by the signing of a final communiquÃ© in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the Treaty as of the year 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed on a deadline for completing the border bridge, according to their capabilities, in 2005.
They both agreed to postpone this deadline to the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as investor.
Germany co-finances the construction of the bridge by 42.13 %.
In the period up to 1999, RMD had proposed that the border bridge should have a prestressed steel-concrete structure.
In 1999 by agreement with its partners in Germany RMD approved a composite steel-concrete structure.
They justified this decision by referring to the reduction of pillar pairs from seven to five and the resulting ecological benefit for the valley.
In addition, a comparative calculation done by RMD stated that the composite steel-concrete structure would be the less costly option.
But there was an error in the calculation.
The calculation stated that the new composite steel-concrete structure would be only 397 m long.
In fact, it is 5% longer.
RMD committed grave errors in the public procurement procedure.
RMD failed to prepare tender documents adequately describing both assessment criteria and sub-criteria used for comparing the bids.
This error resulted in subjective and ambiguous assessment by the bids evaluation commission and the managing director respectively.
A non-successful bidder contested the results of the tender procedure.
The subsequent inquiry by the Office for the Protection of Competition caused the bridge construction contract to be signed later than originally anticipated.
That meant that 2004 year summer building season after bid evaluation was lost, and the time for construction of the bridge was shortened.
The constructor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time, but this involved a substantial price increase.
The steps offered included dual assembly of the bridge superstructures, a change in the pillar design and erecting an assembly facility.
In addition, the constructor was unable to obtain the originally proposed type of steel in the time required.
The new type of steel â at a higher cost of some â¬ 4 million borne fully by RMD â made it possible to shorten the time for performing anti-corrosion protection, which subsequently made it possible to cut the overall time needed to build the border bridge.
Compared to the price offered in the bid of some â¬ 18.3 million net, as a result of the accelerated procedure and further funding adjustments, the total cost of the border bridge will rise considerably.
Shortened time for works resulted in price increase in the range of some â¬ 5.9 million.
Currently net costs amount to some â¬ 25.9 million not considering price escalation (as of October 2006).
Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels
The two supreme audit institutions analysed the prices of bridges on the D 8 and A 17 in order to identify bridges whose price was excessively high, and compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech sides.
The analysis relied on arithmetical statistics.
Tunnels on the D 8 were also compared with equivalent tunnels on motorways (A 71, A 38 and A 4) in Germany;
there were no similar tunnels on the A 17 motorway.
In preparing this part of the audit, it was important to identify relevant prices accurately.
The main principles determined by the two supreme audit institutions for comparing the prices of bridges included the following: to rely on the actual price paid for the bridge without value added tax (VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany differ and are subject to change); not to consider prices for special bridge foundations; to convert prices in CZK into â¬ using the European Central Bank rate applicable on 30.12.2005 (CZK 29 = â¬ 1).
Bridges of various construction types (such as steel concrete, prestressed steel-concrete, composite steel-concrete and steel) and various sizes are found on both the D 8 and A 17.
In an effort to homogenise the reviewed bridge constructions, the bridges were divided into categories based on construction type.
Within these categories the bridge size was also taken into account in the analyses.
Concrete bridges were by far the most common type of construction on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The analysis focused chiefly on this category of bridge, as the large size of the sample made it possible to use arithmetical statistics and improved the reliability of results.
Audit work revealed that the prices per m2 of concrete bridges on the D 8 and A 17 depend on the bridge size (its length, area): the bigger the bridge, the lower the price per m 2 of the bridge.
The correlation between price and size is stronger for German bridges than Czech bridges (see graphs below).
Two concrete bridges were identified on the A 17 and four on the D 8 whose price is markedly higher.
These bridges were identified partly by a method enabling the ascertainment of atypical values in a set of numbers and partly by regressive analysis taking into account the correlation between the bridge price and its size (distance above the regressive curve is a key to identifying atypically expensive bridges).
Information about the atypically high price of the said bridges should, however, be regarded merely as an indicator as to which bridges to focus on.
In order to be able to make a generally applicable conclusion the causes of the high price would have to be analysed in each identified case.
One reason may be inefficient administrative action but it may also have been caused by environmental protection requirements or any other acceptable reasons.
Given that the Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than the German ones (see table below), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and length might lead one to expect that they would be cheaper.
The hypothesis about the lower cost of Czech concrete bridges is also supported by the lower cost of labour in the construction industry in the Czech Republic than in Germany.
The results of the analysis, however, indicate that the price of concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
Two possible reasons for this state of affairs were identified during joint meetings.
1.
In Germany most bridges are procured as independent projects.
That makes it possible for small and medium-sized regional firms to take part in the tender.
In the Czech Republic many bridges are procured as part of a contract for a part of motorway route that is several kilometres long.
Small and medium-sized firms do not take part in this kind of tender, as the job is too big for them.
2.
There is greater variety in bridge structures used in the Czech Republic than in Germany.
In this context the NKÃ found that the type of bridge structure is decided long before it is built.
The decision is made during the time when the RMD submits the zoning decision application.
At this time the RMD selects bridge types from several alternatives, but economy plays only a minor role in decision-making.
A general conclusion regarding bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany would only be possible on the basis of a thorough analysis of the building work market in both countries; that would have been beyond the scope of this audit, however.
The border bridge is the most expensive composite steel-concrete bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
In the case of tunnels it was found that tunnels on the D 8 cost twice as much as tunnels in Germany.
Yet a comparison of the principal technical construction parameters of tunnels on the D 8 and tunnels in Germany revealed no fundamental difference.
The considerable price differences could be attributed to the fact that in the Czech Republic, there is no real competition in the tunnel building sector.
Nevertheless, the low number of tunnels made it impossible to reach generally applicable conclusions.
Effectiveness and efficiency of the motorway Dresden â Prague
The independent Czech Republic was established in 1993.
In the same year, the government approved the concept of motorway network development.
The D 8 was to be extended step by step from Prague towards the state frontier to Germany.
Section No. 0805 through the Central Bohemian Highlands was to be built before the border section No. 0807.
The Czech Republic is building the D 8 under programme financing.
Two objectives of the construction of the D 8 are defined in programme No. 327 220 âConstruction of the D 8 Motorway, Prague â Usti nad Labem â Czech/ German State Frontierâ:
1.
improve the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem â national objective;
2.
improve the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Berlin-Istanbul Pan-European Transport Corridor IV â international objective.
According to the programme, construction of the section leading through the Central Bohemian Highlands was scheduled for completion in June 2008 and construction of the border section No. 0807 for June 2007.
It should be noted that the deadline for completing the construction is not identical with the deadline for putting into operation.
The NKÃ ascertained that the preparatory work for the construction of the section leading through the Central Bohemian Highlands is currently in the official zoning decision stage.
Ecological activists have contested this decision with legal actions.
A definitive ruling on the actions is pending.
It therefore cannot be ruled out that the section leading through the Central Bohemian Highlands will be completed several years later than stated in the programme documentation.
During summer 2006 the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed postponing the term of completing of section No. 0805 up to year 2010.
As a result of these circumstances, construction of the border section did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
The RMD performed a capital expenditure appraisal of the border section of the D 8 No. 0807 and of section No. 0805 via the Central Bohemian Highlands in the years 1999 â 2001.
The investment cost included in this capital expenditure appraisal amounts to some â¬ 639 million together for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.
Table 2: Results of the economic assessment (EIRR=economic internal return rate)
All planned motorways and highspeed roads open, both sections of the D 8 open in 2007.
Traffic volume on the northern part of the border section of 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
All planned motorways and highspeed roads open, both sections of the D 8 open in 2007.
Traffic volume on the northern part of the border section of 22.000 vehicles per day in 2010.
All planned motorways and highspeed roads open, both sections of the D 8 open in 2007.
Traffic volume on the northern part of the border section of 25 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The economic analysis performed in 2001 relied on the assumption that the section near the frontier and the Central Bohemian Highlands section would both be finished at the time.
At the time of audit it is clear that the Central Bohemian Highlands section will not be opened by the original deadline.
That will reduce the aforementioned EIRR values.
The ex VAT costs of both sections specified as of 31.12.2005 were â¬ 897 million, i.e. 27.4% higher than the cost level applied in the economic analysis in 2001.
There is a risk, however, that section No. 0805 will follow a different, more expensive route, which would impact on the aforementioned economic viability level.
As a result of the economic analysis, the construction of both motorway sections is economically viable at a traffic volume of at least 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The forecast for 2008 indicated 22 940 vehicles per day but a study addressing the issue of detour routes in place of the missing section through the Central Bohemian Highlands reckons with a traffic volume in year 2007 of 12 600 to 13 750 vehicles per day, which puts the investment below the economic viability threshold.
A higher traffic load on the detour routes in place of the lacking Central Bohemian Highlands section gives rise to a high probability of congestion and thus also increased external costs that were not taken into account during the original economic analysis.
The aforementioned reduction in revenues and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR the construction of the D 8 border section was supposed to have will not be attained.
Proto je stavba pÅÃ­hraniÄnÃ­ho Ãºseku D 8 neefektivnÃ­.
When building the A 17 motorway, cost overruns also occurred similarly to those of the two above sections of the D 8.
As part of the overall economic assessment for the 1992 federal long distance road plan, the German Federal Ministry for Transport assumed a cost of some â¬ 320 million.
The resulting cost benefit ratio was 4.6.
In the meantime, costs have soared to some â¬ 670 million reducing the cost benefit ratio by more than half.
Apart from the parallel audit work undertaken conjunctively with the NKÃ the BRH had audited the planning and construction of motorway A 17 in the years 2003 and 2005.
When doing so the BRH found that the relevant authorising states body demanded a landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17 that was not needed.
During the course of audit work, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the German road works administration that the tunnel was not necessary.
As a result savings were made that accounted for single building cost of some â¬ 10 million and â¬ 0.15 million of annual operating costs.
When examining the first section of the A 17 the BRH found that the building project had not been adequately prepared.
This is illustrated by the following example:
At the planning stage, the road works administration failed to do a survey on the condition of the bedrock at the DÃ¶lzschen rock, since it was not easily accessible.
Only after the tunnel driving machine reached the rock they made up for it.
The tests showed that the interior rock was weathered to a higher extent than expected at the time of tendering.
This resulted in costly measures such as anchoring, injections and protection nets against rockfall that amounted to some â¬ 3.3 million.
The road work administration had to bear the costs not only for additional extra operations such as the safety measures at the DÃ¶lzschen rock but also measures that would not have been needed if the building project had been adequately prepared in the first place.
Such expenditures include cost for disrupted building operations (â¬ 3.2 million), additional training for drilling staff (â¬ 0.5 million) and soaring wages and expenses on goods as a result of time overruns for the project (â¬ 7 million).
Thus excess costs amounted to some â¬ 10.7 million that were not matched by any additional value.
On the basis of the lessons learnt from this project and other projects audited the BRH demanded the Federal Ministry to take more rigorous leadership regarding its oversight over road works.
In this context, the Federal Ministry should provide the necessary momentum for road works administrations to introduce quality assurance systems.
Benefits of cooperation for the BRH and the NKÃ The cooperation achieved the objectives of both audit institutions.
The BRH now has audit findings on the preparation, contract public procurement procedure and course of the construction of the border bridge.
The two supreme audit institutions developed a database of the prices of bridges and tunnels that can be relied on in future audits.
The NKÃ found that the main technical construction parameters of bridges, tunnels and the route of the D 8 motorway are no different from the A 17 parameters.
Auditors of both institutions taking part in the cooperation gained new experiences that can be put to use in future audits.

The Inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to Start a New Internet to Take on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds off of Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historical moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about the personal online data store is that it is completely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, process and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models are completely upended overnight.
"We are not asking their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.

Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross cleric celebrated
The only Church of England cleric to win a Victoria Cross during World War One as a combatant has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years on.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years on from his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the firing line and with the "greatest gallantry" led the line forward before rushing a field-gun single-handed and knocked out three of the detachment.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know that I could never live up to but something which is humbling."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "feeling very honoured to play a part in the parade" and added "the valour of a genuine hero is being demonstrated by the support that is going to be given by a lot of people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this, you have stayed up all night to watch the a packed Bellator 206 only to be denied watching the main event.
The bill from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main card and was being shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as "some sort of sick joke."
"It's government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not suitable so they had to switch to children's programming, " said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said that they are going to work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about the replay, I think that we can probably work it out," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to work this out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it switched over there were a lot of texts going back and forth and they all were not friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a governmental issue.
I can promise you the next time it's not going to happen.
We'll keep it down to five fights instead of six - like we normally do - and we tried to overdeliver for the fans and we just went over.
It's an unfortunate situation."

Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he did not realise until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a number of months off because of illness.
Appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling different, have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to be able to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "caught me by surprise."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year but he said the age gap had never been an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics aged 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June, to a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his dad did not accept he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had their tickets yet for London 2012 - as he wanted to be on the front row.
"I couldn't say to him 'you're not going to be around to be on the front row dad'," he said.
"I was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he'd actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I had dreamt of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had resonated with him in the build up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.

Report on the Results of the Parallel Audit of the Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany
Foreword
The Lima Declaration was adopted in 1977 and emphasises that the supreme audit institutions (SAI) have powers to carry out audits of all public finances.
The Declaration requests that SAI shall be empowered to audit the collection of taxes as extensively as possible.
The European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes one of the most significant parts of the public revenues.
The VI Congress EUROSAI held in Bonn in 2005 focused on an audit of public revenues by SAI.
One of the important steps on the way to optimise the audit activity of a SAI is to work out a special strategy for audit of public revenues.
This relates above all to taxes as the biggest source of public revenues that is also at a high risk of loss.
Since the economies of individual countries are more and more interconnected and interdependent SAI can be, in a certain manner, unable to perform audit activities without cooperation with SAI of other countries.
As an example we can mention the audit of internationally organised fraud that causes significant revenue losses in many countries.
In fighting against such crime, the cooperation between authorities is a necessity.
SAI that carry out audits in this area need to be willing to work closely together.
The idea to carry out an audit on value added tax (hereinafter âVATâ) and the VIES system came up at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was performed in cooperation between the Czech Supreme Audit Office and the German Supreme Audit Institution, Bundesrechnungshof.
During following detailed preparations, both SAI had to familiarise with the law environment and procedures of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
Based on an information analysis, we had made the selection of audit topics that we put on the audit programme.
Achieving efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of VAT is a long-term problem and individual countries (the EC Member States especially) are looking for an answer on how to improve the system, how to simplify VAT collection and make it more transparent.
We are convinced that the results of our audit may help not only to improve tax administratorsÂ´ work, but also serve as a basis for improving an international information exchange system.
Report on the Results of the Parallel Audit of the Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany
Introduction
Audit number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 â 2005 â 1215
Subject of audit:
(CZ) Administration of value added tax following accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(D) Review of the administrative cooperation in the field of VAT according to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004
Objective of audit:
(CZ) The objective of the audit in the Czech Republic was to review the procedure used by financial authorities in administrating value added tax following integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter âECâ), connected with free movement of goods and services, and to review the use of the VIES, particularly monitoring the exercise of the right to exempt intraCommunity deliveries from value added tax.
(D) The objective of the audit was to review the system of intraCommunity VAT control with a special focus on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT according to the above mentioned regulations.
As a result of this, weaknesses should be reported and recommendations be developed to address the problems stated.
Value Added Tax Information Exchange System The audits were performed by the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic (hereinafter the âSAOâ) and by the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter âBRHâ) in mutual cooperation on the basis of an agreement concluded between the two audit institutions on June 8, 2006.
The cooperation primarily concerned the review of selected commercial transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter âCRâ) and from the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter âGermanyâ), use of information obtained via international cooperation between tax administrations and comparison of the VAT administration systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits was processed in the sense of European Directive No. 31 for implementing the INTOSAI audit standards.
The audited period covered the period from May 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel audits
Based on an agreement between the two SAI the parallel audit on the administration of VAT in the CR and Germany was carried out.
Besides the main point â exchange of information based on the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 â the audit covered other topics as for instance the registration of taxpayers, VAT returns and recapitulative statements that are closely linked with it.
Additionally, the legal situation in terms of international bus transportation of passengers and the comparison of certain statistical data were part of the audit.
By comparing the systems of administration of VAT in the two countries differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT.
Whereas entrepreneurs in Germany are registered regardless of the volume of their turnover, in the CR the prime criterion (except others) for registration is exceeding of the turnover limit set down in the law on VAT.
In the CR, taxpayers are assigned one tax identification number only, which they also use in intra-Community transactions.
For VAT registration purposes in Germany taxpayers are assigned a tax number that serves only for business transactions within the German territory.
If German taxpayers intend to do intra-Community transactions, they have to apply for assignment of a special identification number, so-called VAT ID.
Since the different ways of registration cause problems, the conditions should be harmonised in the whole EC (see 4.1).
2) International bus transportation of passengers.
In the CR, the international bus transportation of passengers is exempt from VAT with the right for VAT deduction.
In Germany, the part of transportation that takes place in the German territory is subject to VAT.
At EC level, efforts should be undertaken to harmonise the situation, in the sense of article 393 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC, on the common system of VAT (see 4.2).
3) VAT returns.
While in the CR taxpayers submit VAT returns only for particular taxable periods (month or quarter), taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of a calendar year, they have to submit an annual VAT return.
In contrast to Czech taxpayers, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns electronically.
Introducing the obligation to submit VAT returns electronically in the CR would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Recapitulative statements.
Whereas taxpayers in the CR submit recapitulative statements to tax offices, in Germany taxpayers submit recapitulative statements to the CLO.
Therefore, tax offices in the CR have the data contained in recapitulative statements available immediately after their submission.
German tax offices have information from recapitulative statements available only after their processing at the CLO.
Combating VAT fraud requires updated information about intra-Community transactions as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of recapitulative statements would shorten the time lag between the date of the transaction and the update of VIES data.
Consequently, this would allow timely review of the taxation in the Member State of the acquirer (see 4.4).
For this purpose all Member States of the EC would have to introduce the same deadline for submission of recapitulative statement.
5) International exchange of information in the area of VAT.
On receiving a request for information, the Czech CLO observes compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not follow up elapsed time.
As a result of this the German tax administration dealt with a significantly lower percentage of received requests within the set deadline.
Because of these problems the BRH recommended to the German CLO to introduce a steady reminding exercise (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of both Member States is developing its own risk management system (hereinafter âRMSâ), that has its strengths and weaknesses.
The SAO and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by only one Member State.
Successful criteria, components or approaches of a RMS have to be exchanged and implemented in each Member State of the EC, if not so fraudsters will choose that Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of cooperation, the two SAI reviewed selected cases of intra-Community transactions processed by tax entities in the CR and Germany.
Thirty-one cases of business transactions were reviewed jointly using the legal provisions of the CLO, where there were doubts about their realization, their proper treatment or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The SAI found that:
In some cases, tax offices made use of the information obtained via international exchange and have reassessed taxpayerâs VAT liability.
In those cases, taxpayers either unlawfully applied the right for exemption of supplies from VAT, or did not declare acquisition of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, tax offices could not make use of the information obtained, because the information was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of differing legal provisions in both Member States.
In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to reply to a request for information.
Some cases were detected, where taxpayers wrongly declared business transactions in their recapitulative statements.
As a result of this, data in VIES were erroneous and therefore the tax administrators had to review those cases (see 6).
Audit procedure
Audit procedure in the CR
The audit was performed in the period from June 2006 to March 2007 by the Division II â Department of State Budget Incomes and by the territorial departments of Central Bohemia, North-Western Bohemia, Southern Bohemia Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
The audited entities were: the Ministry of Finance (hereinafter the âMoFâ) and 10 tax offices â the tax office in Humpolec, the tax office in Jihlava, the tax office in KadaÅ, the tax office in Liberec, the tax office in Nymburk, the tax office in Otrokovice, the tax office for Prague 1, the tax office for Prague 4, the tax office in Sokolov and the tax office in TÅinec.
The SAO Collegium approved the conclusions of this audit on April 23, 2007.
Audit procedure in Germany
The audit was performed in the period from July 2006 to February 2007 by the audit unit for indirect taxes and staff of the assigned regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
It was part of the audit programme for 2006 and therefore announced to the Federal MoF in 2006.
After a test phase the audit started in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later selected by the SAO, the BRH notified a number of federal states of the audit mission.
Besides interviews at the Federal MoF and the CLO the audit was conducted in the following federal states:
Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files of the following tax offices were included:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, MÃ¼hlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, FÃ¼rstenfeldbruck, MÃ¼nchen-KÃ¶rperschaften, MÃ¼nchen II, IV und MÃ¼nchen V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord und Hamburg fÃ¼r GroÃunternehmen, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, KÃ¶ln-Mitte, KÃ¶ln-Porz, KÃ¶ln-SÃ¼d, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-SÃ¼d, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I und Zschopau.
Additionally, discussions were held with the tax offices Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, DÃ¼sseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim und Verden.
The audit findings were reported to the MoF in May 2007.
Cooperation of the two audit institutions
As part of preparing parallel audits, several meetings of representatives of the two audit institutions were held in the period prior to their commencement.
Participants in these meetings became acquainted with the organisation of the tax administrations, legislation on VAT and the VAT administration system in the two countries.
The subject matter of the testing phase was agreed at the meeting that was held in May 2006.
The results of the testing phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, also a timetable was agreed for further procedure, and the following subjects for parallel audits were selected:
1. Registration of VAT payers.
2.
International passenger bus transportation â legislation in the CR and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the processing of requests for information and furthermore how the tax offices reviewed selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, and in the spontaneous information supplied between the CR and Germany.
4. VAT returns.
5.
Recapitulative statements.
6.
Statistical information on supply and acquisition of goods between the CR and the Germany.
7. VAT risk management.
At a meeting of the SAO and the BRH, held in December 2006, the two parties became acquainted with the audit procedure in the CR and Germany and discussed results achieved in the parallel audits.
A report on the results of the parallel audits of the administration of VAT between the CR and Germany was elaborated at the working meeting in July 2007.
4. Administration of value added tax in the CR and Germany
Registrace plÃ¡tcÅ¯ k DPH
A) Taxpayers with their offi cial seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR
Pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on administration of taxes and fees (hereinafter âAct No. 337/1992 Coll.â) the term tax entity refers to a taxpayer, a taxable person and the legal successor of a natural or legal person that is a tax entity definedby law.
As of December 31, 2004, a total of 421,865 tax entities were registered for VAT in the CR.
The number of tax entities registered for VAT has increased to 457,590 by 1 December 2005.
A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, whose turnover in the most recent 12 preceding consecutive calendar months exceeded the sum of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) becomes a taxpayer on the 1st day of the third month following after the month in which he exceeded the registration limit (Â§ 94 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax; hereinafter âAct No. 235/2004 Coll.â).
This person is obliged to submit an application for registration within 15 days after the end of the month in which he exceeded the registration limit.
The current legislation does not permit registering a person obliged to pay tax retroactively in cases taxpayers exceed the legal term to submit the application for registration.
A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, who performs taxable transactions or transactions exempt from VAT with the right to tax deduction, is obliged to register for VAT even if he does not exceed a turnover of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575), provided that he fulfils any of other conditions stated in the Act No. 235/2004 Coll.
A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, who does not fulfil any of the conditions stated by the law, may apply for registration for VAT voluntarily.
When the application for registration is submitted to the competent local tax administrator the registration procedure pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll. starts.
A voluntary VAT payer shall also state, in the application for registration for VAT, the date as of which he requests registration as a VAT payer.
The tax administrator shall verify the data communicated by the tax entity, i.e. the completed application for registration with all its annexes.
If he is in doubt as to the stated data, he shall request the tax entity to explain, supplement or document the data.
When the tax administrator has verified that the tax entity meets the conditions for registration, he shall issue a decision in the form of a certificate stating that the tax entity is registered and that it has been allocated a tax identification number (hereinafter the âIDâ).
In the certificate the tax administrator shall state the date when the registration for VAT became effective and the periodicity of the tax period for VAT.
The taxable period is one calendar quarter unless the taxpayerâs turnover for the previous calendar year reached the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750).
If the taxpayerâs turnover for the previous calendar year reached the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750), the taxable period is one calendar month.
A taxpayer, whose turnover for the previous calendar year attained an amount of CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150), is entitled to choose a calendar month as the tax period and shall notify the tax administrator of this change.
The assignment of an ID in the certificate of registration is always constitutive in character.
The tax entity is obliged to state it in all communications (including payments) with the tax administrator, and in those cases stipulated by a special law (e.g. Act No. 235/2004 Coll., in drawing up tax documents).
The ID contains the code âCZâ and a basic part, consisting of a general identifier.
For natural persons, the general identifier is the birth certificate number or some other general identifier if so stipulated by a special law, and for a legal person, the general identifier is the business identification number (provisions of Â§ 33 (12) of Act No. 337/1992 Coll.).
If the tax entity has not fulfilled its obligation in spite of being requested to do so by the tax administrator, the competent local tax administrator shall register it at his own initiative.
The registration proceeding results in the issuing a Certificate of Registration ex officio, which shall be delivered to the tax entity.
In the CR, a tax entity that has acquired authorisation for a business activity is assigned an ID at the moment of his first registration for any kind of tax.
The tax entity also uses the same ID when he is registered as a VAT payer.
According to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., which came into effect on January 1, 2005, in case of failure to comply with the registration obligation for VAT, the tax administrator may require that the taxable person has to pay up to 10% of the total revenues or income for taxable transactions that this person performed illegally without tax, for the period from the date on which he should have been registered as a taxpayer by law to the date on which he became a taxpayer on the basis of a decision by the tax administrator (provision of Â§ 98 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).
Payment of this stipulated amount is considered to constitute payment of tax of Â§ 98 (3) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. it is not a penalty.
When the conditions laid down by law are met, the registration of a VAT payer may be cancelled for two reasons:
1)
Cancellation of the registration at the taxpayerâs request, i.e. primarily for reasons of the level of turnover, which does not attain the registration limit (Â§ 106 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).
Taxpayers may request cancellation of registration not earlier than 1 year after the date of legal force mentioned in the certificate of registration.
2) Cancellation of registration âex officioâ (Â§ 106 (7) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), âif: a) the taxpayer did not perform any transactions without notification of the reason for this to the tax administrator for a period of 12 consecutive months, b) the taxpayer failed to fulfill his obligations pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., c) the taxpayer ceases to be a person obliged to pay taxesâ.
B) Taxpayers without an official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR A person registered for taxes in another Member State, who does not have an official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, or a foreign person obliged to pay tax, who performs a transaction which takes place in this country and who is a person obliged to report and pay taxes on such supply pursuant to Â§ 108 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. (i.e. an ânon-resident taxpayerâ) becomes a taxpayer on the date of performing this transaction.
This person is obliged to submit an application for registration with the tax office for Prague 1 at the latest on the date of performance of the supply.
In the application for registration, he is obliged to report all VAT IDs that he was assigned to in other Member States or in a third country.
If a ânon-residentâ taxpayer submits an application for registration later than on the date of performance of the first taxable transaction in the CR, the tax office for Prague 1 shall register him retroactively as, pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax entity became a VAT payer on the date of performance of the first taxable transaction in the CR.
In cases of retroactive registration, the tax office for Prague 1 shall request from tax entities a document that the supply was performed (invoices or explanatory letters).
If a ânon-residentâ tax entity requests registration in the CR, prior to performance of the first taxable transaction the tax office for Prague 1 shall request submission of agreements that the performance of the transaction will occur.
As of December 31, 2004, a total of 473 ânon-residentâ taxpayers were registered at the tax office for Prague 1, of which 124 were taxpayers from Germany; as of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 ânon-residentâ taxpayers were registered, of which 233 were taxpayers from Germany.
Pursuant to the provisions of Â§ 106 (9) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., tax administrators shall be authorised to cancel the registration of an ânon-residentâ taxpayer as of January 31 of the following calendar year if this taxpayer does not incur any obligation to report and pay tax.
The SAO found that, if a ânon-residentâ taxpayer submitted a tax return abroad for postal transport on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the legal requirements of the date for submitting a tax return, the tax office often has not yet received it by 31 January.
In cases where these facts, decisive for the possibility of cancelling registration, are known by the tax office later than 31 January, it is not possible to cancel the registration for VAT for the ânon-residentâ taxpayer in the CR in the given calendar year.
Registration of taxpayers in Germany
Due to the legal provisions in the German fiscal code (Â§Â§ 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter âAOâ) anybody who performs a business is obliged to inform the municipality and/or the tax office in charge.
The deadline for submitting the information is one month after the start of the business.
The municipality conveys the information to the tax authorities.
If the tax authority finds out a going but unregistered business the competent tax office is able to register the taxpayer ex officio â even retroactively.
Taxpayers in Germany, both being resident or non-resident, are legally obliged to register for VAT whenever they fulfil the criteria set forth in Â§ 2 of the German VAT law (hereinafter âUStG).
This does not depend on the volume of turnover produced.
A voluntary registration does not exist in Germany.
For entrepreneurs who are resident abroad special tax offices exist.
For instance for those who have their seat in the CR the tax office Chemnitz-SÃ¼d is responsible.
As of 30 April 2004 a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered by the tax office Chemnitz-SÃ¼d; as of 1 March 2006 a total of 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.
The BRH found that those special tax offices frequently denied the registration of so called quasi-dependent freelancers with a residence in the new eastern Member States of the EC.
Since after joining the EC the labour permits for employees of the ten new European Member States are limited, those freelancers tried to avoid these limits by starting a business.
These businesses do not fulfil the criteria for entrepreneurs as set in Â§ 2 UStG because they are usually dependent on a sole employer who determines their labour time and the way of doing their labour.
In order to get registered the entrepreneur has to complete a questionnaire of the competent tax office, in which he has to give information about the company and the activities performed.
The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding for all tax offices in Germany.
It is processed either in special units of the tax office or in the general units that are responsible for the assessment of taxpayers.
With the help of this form a risk assessment of the individual taxpayer is carried out before the tax office issues a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions follows specific rules:
First three figures provide the information which tax office is in charge of, the subsequent three (or four) give information about which department in the tax office is responsible, the next five (or four) are for classifying taxpayers whereas the last one is always a check digit.
If an entrepreneur intends to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID in order to receive tax-exempt intraCommunity supplies.
A VAT ID is granted by the CLO upon application if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and has a VAT number.
The VAT ID will be assigned automatically by the CLO when taxpayers declare intra-Community deliveries in their VAT returns.
The structure of the VAT ID is the country code (DE) followed by a string of nine numbers.
An entrepreneur can be deregistered: 1. On application (for instance when he gave up his business) after all the administrative work is done (assessments for all business years) and 2. in case the tax administration realises that he no longer carries out a business.
Usually the validity of the VAT ID is aligned with the validity of the VAT number.
The tax offices have to inform the CLO about the cancellation of the VAT number so that the CLO can end the validity of the VAT ID in those cases.
According to German VAT law (Â§ 19 (1) UStG) resident taxpayers are not obliged to pay VAT in case 1. the turnover plus respective VAT of the previous calendar year did not exceed the amount of EUR 17,500 and 2. is not likely to exceed the amount of EUR 50,000 in the following year.
The so-called âKleinunternehmerâ (small entrepreneurs) are not allowed to invoice other entrepreneurs for VAT and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
Though they are not obliged to pay VAT small entrepreneurs have to be registered by the tax office and have to submit an annual VAT return.
A small entrepreneur can declare the non-application of Â§ 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He is then allowed to invoice VAT and to deduct input tax.
Non-resident taxpayers may appoint a fiscal representative (Â§ 22a UStG).
The precondition for this is that they are involved in tax exempt transactions only and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur so that he does not need to register for VAT.
The invoices have to mention that fiscal representation is applied.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation is different in both countries.
Whereas in Germany entrepreneurs are registered independent of their turnover volume, in the CR, the first criteria (besides other) for registration is the excess of the limit set forth in the VAT law.
If a tax entity does not exceed the set limit, it has an option to ask for voluntary registration.
The registration process is standardised in Germany but differences may occur because of varying organisational patterns in the federal states.
In the CR, a taxpayer is assigned a tax identification number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In case taxpayers register for VAT, they use the same ID also in intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, a taxpayer registering for VAT is assigned a tax number serving only for transactions within the territory of Germany.
If the German taxpayer intends to do intra-Community transactions, he has to ask for assignment of a special identification number, a so-called VAT ID.
Both the SAO and the BRH found the German two-stage system of registration could cause a lot of misunderstandings in other Member States such as the CR that allocates one single identification number for both national VAT registration and registration for intra-Community transactions.
On the other hand, the two-stage system permits the retroactive (national) registration in cases where taxpayers refuse to inform the municipality or the competent tax office about his business.
This retroactive registration ensures the proper VAT assessment of previous assessment periods, especially an exact estimation of a VAT liability.
Since the different ways of registration cause problems, the conditions should be harmonised in the whole EC.
German Parliament recently decided to establish a tax identification number (hereinafter TIN).
The Federal Finance Office will allocate the TIN after the birth of a natural person.
This TIN will be valid for the whole life of a natural person resident in Germany.
If a natural person starts a business the competent tax office will apply for an economic TIN that will be used as a VAT ID.
So in future there should be no time lag between the national registration of a taxpayer and the allocation of the VAT ID.
The work to implement an IT medium to administrate the TINs has not been finished until now.
International passenger bus transportation
Legislation in the CR
Pursuant to the provisions of Â§ 70 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the transportation of passengers between the individual Member States and also between the Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT in the CR, with the right for tax deduction, as from May 1, 2004.
This transportation is exempt from VAT even if performed by entrepreneurs who are registered for taxes in other Member States or a foreign person obliged to pay tax.
In this respect, return transport is considered to be a separate transport.
If ânon-residentâ tax entities do not perform any other economic activity in the CR except for international passenger bus transport, they are not obliged to register in the CR as VAT payers.
International passenger transport was exempted from VAT in the CR on the basis of the Act on Accession of the CR, Annex No. V, Chap. 5 (1) (b), where it is stated that:
âFor the purposes of applying Article 28(3)(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may maintain an exemption from value added tax on international transport of passengers, referred to in point 17 of Annex F to the Directive, until the condition set out in Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or for as long as the same exemption is applied by any of the present Member States, whichever is the earlier.â
Legislation in Germany
According to Article 46 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 as implemented into Â§ 3b (1) UStG the place of the supply of transport of passengers is the place where the route takes place.
So the German taxation does not make a distinction between a national and an international cross-border transport of passengers.
Only the part of the transport occurring on German territory, is a taxable supply of transport in Germany.
Also the German taxation does not distinguish between resident and non-resident taxpayers.
If a non-resident taxpayer transports passengers through Germany the part of the route in Germany is also considered as a taxable supply of transport.
The non-resident taxpayer has to announce his intention to supply the transport of passengers to the tax office in charge before he accomplishes his services in Germany.
The tax office registers the non-resident taxpayer for taxation (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for any bus or coach that is named in the taxpayerâs announcement.
The taxpayer has to declare his taxable supplies of transport in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, the tax office Chemnitz-SÃ¼d registered 741 Czech taxpayers whose business was the transport of passengers.
If the transport of passengers is supplied to a resident taxable person for VAT, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay VAT to the tax office by himself.
Instead of him the resident acquirer of the services has to pay VAT to the tax office and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident taxpayer; this process is known as reverse charge and consistent with Article 196 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
Apart from the announcement of a non-resident taxpayer and his VAT return the German tax administration has several means to assess the accurate declaration of taxable supplies of transport of passengers:
Mobile control groups of the customs authority audit the certificates of foreign-licensed busses that are used to transport passengers through Germany.
After each audit the mobile control groups send an inspection note to the tax office in charge.
If the bus driver lacks a valid certificate the mobile control group is authorised to demand the VAT from the bus driver before he continues the transport.
The non-resident taxpayer can deduct this paid VAT from the tax calculated in his VAT return.
If the tax office has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return it can announce an audit that has to take place in the tax office or it can use the means of administrative cooperation that are named in the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).
Even if the non-resident taxpayer declines the payment of the lawfully stated VAT, the tax office can ask for the administrative cooperation of Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
To review a non-resident taxpayerâs VAT return or the fulfilment of his obligations, the BRH considered all these means of administrative cooperation as too labour-intensive compared to the small amounts of VAT that have to be paid for taxable supplies of transport of passengers.
Especially an audit of a non-resident taxpayerâs accounting leads to disproportional costs for both taxpayers and tax administration.
The latter has to audit the foreign accounting that does not only mean to understand the foreign language but to also know the foreign accounting standards.
So this audit is likely to take more time than an audit of a resident taxpayer, yet the audit is restricted to those passenger transports, that take place in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer has not only to accept the audit rights of his national tax administration but also audits of other Member States wherever he transports passengers.
Moreover, for each Member State in that only one supply of transport of passengers takes place, taxpayers have to fulfil any duties of taxation in all of these Member States, respectively in all different languages and using all tax forms of these EC Member States.
So the actual taxation of crossborder transport of passengers causes unreasonable bureaucratic costs.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation in both countries is different.
In the CR, the transport of passengers between the individual Member States of the EC and also between the Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT with the right for tax deduction, on the basis of the Act on Accession of the CR.
In Germany, the part of the transport, that takes place within the German territory, is a taxable transaction.
If a non-resident taxpayer provides such transport for the first time, he is obliged to announce it to a competent tax office in advance.
The tax office registers taxpayers and taxpayers have to declare the taxable portion of transport in a tax return in Germany.
Applying the law in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three of four Czech taxpayers registered in the tax office Chemnitz-SÃ¼d do their business in the transport of passengers.
Compared to the efforts required tax revenue is rather low.
The Member States â that levy VAT in accordance to Article 46 of the Council directive 2006/112/EC of November 28th, 2006, on the common system of VAT â are burdened with time-consuming duties without a financially sensible goal.
To avoid the disproportional costs to assess the VAT, the supplies of cross-border transport of passengers should be taxed in one Member State only.
This could be the state where the transport begins or where the supplier is resident.
Such taxation would require a modification of the Council directive 2006/112/EC.
VAT returns
Submitting and processing of VAT returns in the CR
A taxpayer is obliged to submit a VAT return on a form prescribed by the MoF within 25 days after the end of the taxable period, even if he has not incurred a tax liability, unless the law stipulates otherwise.
The actual tax liability falls due within the deadline for submitting the VAT return, with the exception of tax assessed in connection with import of goods pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., where the due date for the taxes is stipulated by the customs regulations.
If a returnable overpayment occurs as a consequence of excessive deduction, it is returned to the taxpayer without request within 30 days after assessing the excessive deduction.
The deadline is not applied in cases, where the tax administrator commences tax proceedings concerning taxpayerâs tax liability.
In accordance with Â§ 73 (11) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the right to deduct input tax may be exercised in a regular VAT return at the latest for the last taxable period of the calendar year in which the right to tax deduction could be exercised.
After expiry of this deadline, the right to deduct input tax may further be exercised within 3 years after the end of the tax period in which the right to tax deduction could first have been exercised.
However, this is possible only through submission of an additional VAT return.
An amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from January 1, 2005, permits submission of an additional VAT return only for the period when the right to tax deduction could first have been exercised.
A taxpayer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return if a) the sum of the corrections increases the tax liability, b) he performs corrections in which the last known tax liability does not change, but only information formerly stated by the tax entity is changed, c) he corrects the rate and amount of taxes pursuant to Â§ 49 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.
A taxpayer may submit an additional VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces his tax liability.
The taxpayer is obliged to submit the additional VAT return by the end of the following month after determination of these facts.
A VAT return may be submitted in electronic form either via the Internet or on a technical data carrier.
Submission by Internet may be performed as a submission with a data report attached with a certified electronic signature or as a submission without attaching a data report with a certified electronic signature.
If a data report is not attached with a certified electronic signature, it must also be submitted in written form, i.e. delivery of the computer file to the tax administrator (e-form).
The VAT return contains separate lines related to values of intra-Community supply/acquisition of goods.
Values of acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.
Some lines are used for the purpose of primary automated controls as part of the ATIS system.
The value of goods supplied to other EC Member States for entrepreneurs registered for tax in other Member States is compared to the data given in the recapitulative statements submitted by Czech taxpayers.
The value of goods acquired from other Member States from entrepreneurs registered for tax in other Member States is compared with the values obtained via the VIES system from recapitulative statements of taxpayers from other Member States of the EC.
Under the ATIS system, a test of the trustworthiness of VAT returns takes place at the tax office.
This test occurs automatically as the VAT return cannot be assessed without performance of the test.
The test of the trustworthiness includes a calculation of the trustworthiness criteria and an evaluation of the risky types of VAT returns.
Pursuant to the Provisions of Â§ 37 (1) of Act No. 337/1992 Coll., the tax office may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) on a person who does not meet his obligations of a non-monetary nature following from this or a special tax law or imposed in a decision pursuant to this law.
Automated tax information system, which the tax office uses for technical support for administration of taxes.
The SAO found that the tax offices mostly did not make use of the possibility of imposing a fine on taxpayers for failure to submit a VAT return.
Submitting and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany we differentiate between preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT returns and the annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns nevertheless have to submit an annual VAT return.
Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT have to submit an annual VAT return.
Taxpayers generally have to submit quarterly VAT returns by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which VAT arises (Â§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT liability exceeded EUR 6,136 in the previous calendar year or in case of a newly established business the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly VAT returns by the 10th day following the respective month.
The taxpayer may also choose to submit monthly VAT returns if there was a refund in the preceding year, which exceeded EUR 6,136 (Â§ 18 (2a) UStG).
VAT returns need not be submitted if the annual VAT did not exceed EUR 512.
The corresponding VAT liability has to be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax period in which the VAT arose.
A refund may lead to a more detailed investigation by the tax authorities.
Deadlines (by law) for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of excessive VAT do not exist.
To achieve the refund in time, it is possible to offer a security for the repayable amount.
It is a basic principle to process VAT returns and refunds promptly.
Under German VAT law this time limit may be extended (Â§ 18 (6) UStG).
Such extension has to be applied for separately.
Taxpayers may submit VAT returns and pay the corresponding VAT liabilities one month later, provided that in case of monthly returns a special advance payment is made.
This payment is balanced against the December VAT liability.
Whenever a mistake is detected a corrected VAT return has to be submitted by the entrepreneur.
An âadditionalâ VAT return does not exist.
Once the annual VAT return which has to be submitted until 31 May of the following calendar year is filed with the tax office the entrepreneur cannot correct a wrong preliminary VAT return but his wrong annual VAT return.
A correction of this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxpayer is possible during the following four years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was submitted.
As a rule, after these four years an annual VAT return may be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or tax evasion.
Taxpayers are obliged to submit the preliminary VAT returns electronically.
The tax offices to avoid undue hardships can apply exceptions to this rule.
Submission of the annual VAT return is possible on paper or via Internet with or without certification.
If done without certification taxpayers have to submit the return once more on paper with their personal signature.
In cases of non-submission of VAT returns the tax administration is authorised to make a rough estimate of the taxpayerâs turnover.
In cases of delayed submission an additional penalty charge can be levied on the taxpayer (the maximum is 10 % of the tax to be paid or EUR 25,000).
During a previous audit the BRH found that the tax offices frequently do not impose this default fine.
In the other cases the tax offices imposed the penalty the amount was assessed inconsistently and highhandedly.
So the default fine misses its goal to shorten the average delay particularly in the submission of the annual VAT return.
The tax return contains separate lines related to values of intra-Community supply/acquisition of goods.
Values of acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.
Non-taxable transactions have to be declared in a separate line of the VAT return.
VAT returns that are submitted on paper have to be recorded either via scanner or by special staff.
The data of electronically submitted VAT returns are available to the tax administrator immediately.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data are logged in the system the risk management is applied to it and all cases meeting certain criteria are selected.
Those VAT returns chosen have to be checked by the tax administrator based on the inspection note produced by the system (see 5.2).
Although the tax administration has to estimate roughly the VAT the taxpayer has to pay, the estimated tax has to be as exact as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the CR, taxpayers submit VAT returns until 25 days after the end of a taxable period.
Depending on taxpayerâs turnover, taxable period is either the calendar quarter orcalendar month.
In Germany, taxpayers submit preliminary VAT returns, depending on their tax liability in the previous year either until 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
By 31 May of the following year, taxpayers are obliged to submit an annual VAT return.
The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has some pros and cons:
+ after the expiration of the calendar year taxpayers are able to correct the errors in the monthly preliminary VAT returns by submission of one single VAT return;
â if taxpayers correct their statements concerning intraCommunity transactions the correction cannot be related to a reporting period of the recapitulative statement;
â the federal states compare the data of VIES about intraCommunity acquisitions of German taxpayers not until the annual VAT returns are usually processed.
In accordance with the registration (see 4.1.3) German entrepreneurs are obliged to submit an annual VAT return independently from the amount of their turnover.
This duty enables the German tax authority to check the maximum turnover limit for small entrepreneurs.
Furthermore the tax office in charge is able to compare the annual VAT return with those for direct taxes and with the year-end accounts.
In the CR, tax administrators are able to determine the volume of taxpayerâs turnover only from submitted income tax return.
In contrast to the CR, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit VAT returns electronically.
Introducing the obligation to submit VAT returns in the CR electronically would increase the efficiency of Czech tax administration.
Recapitulative statements
Submitting and processing of recapitulative statements in the CR
Pursuant to the provisions of Â§ 102 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., recapitulative statements (hereinafter âRSâ) are submitted by a taxpayer who supplied goods to another Member State to a person registered for taxes in the other Member State.
Information on the value of goods supplied is always stated in the RS in Czech currency and is classified according to individual tax entities with specification of their VAT IDs, under which they are registered in their country.
Data on services are not provided in the RS.
Taxpayers submit an RS for monthly and quarterly taxable periods for each calendar quarter to the 25th day after its termination to the competent local tax office.
Erroneous data are corrected in the corrected RS within 15 days after identifying the errors.
Erroneous data stated in the RS are always replaced by the data stated in the corrected RS.
Similar to tax returns, taxpayers may also submit RS in electronic form.
If a taxpayer does not submit a RS or corrected RS and was obliged to do so pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator shall invite him to submit them and shall simultaneously advise him about the consequences of not submitting the RS or corrected RS, i.e. that in case of a failure to comply with obligations of a non-monetary nature, the tax administrator is authorised to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) pursuant to Â§ 37 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll.
The SAO found that the tax offices frequently did not make use of the possibility of imposing a fine on taxpayers failing to comply with their legal obligations.
Particularly in relation to submitting RS, tax entities are not adequately motivated to comply with their obligations as a failure to submit RS does not affect their VAT liability.
Pursuant to Â§ 102 (5) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator is obliged to verify data in the RS or corrected RS, to eliminate any lack of clarity and use the data for determining tax liability.
Where the data in the RS and the data in the relevant VAT returns (taxpayers with monthly taxable period) or relevant VAT return (taxpayers with quarterly taxable period) do not correspond, the tax administrator should verify the accuracy of tax liability stated in the VAT return.
The tax entity eliminates erroneous information in the RS through submission of a corrected RS at its own initiative or it may be invited to do so.
The tax administrator shall correct data on supply of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
â if taxpayers can not justify the data stated in the RS (or corrected RS) and therefore correct them by submission of a corrected RS,
â the tax administrator demonstrated that the data stated by taxpayers in the RS or corrected RS are not accurate.
Corrections entered by the tax administrator without the submission of a corrected RS by these taxpayers shall not replace a submission by the tax entity, but only adjust the data in the VIES database so that it is up to date, complete and precise.
Data from the RS are sent to the relevant Member States.
Solely the national financial administrative authority, designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT may send and receive this data. This is the CLO (in CR this function is fulfilled by the MoF, International Cooperation in VAT Administration Department (CLO)).
O_MCTL is an automatic report that the CLO obtains from other Member States.
It contains all the erroneous VAT IDs entered in the sent RS lines.
If the erroneous VAT ID is used on some of the transferred common lines of the RS or corrected RS, an entry is made in the table of the erroneous VAT IDs.
The table contains a âNotification of doubts on VAT IDâ.
The tax administrator verifies the data and records the result of verification in the system.
Concerning acquisition of goods from another Member State, taxpayers are obliged to declare VAT and state the acquisition value in separate lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of discrepancies in the value of the acquired goods declared by Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns and the value of the supplied goods as entered by taxpayers from another Member State in their RS, are sent from the CLO to the tax office for review.
The tax administrators are obliged to investigate discrepancies.
Three situations can occur:
a) The value declared by a Czech taxpayer in the relevant lines of the VAT return is lower than the value of the supply declared by taxpayers from the EC.
In this case, the tax administrator verifies the accuracy of the data.
b) The amount of the difference equals 0.
This situation can occur either through a change in data in the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his RS) or through a change in data in the VAT return (the Czech tax entity submits an additional VAT return by itself in the meantime).
In this case, the tax administrator is free to decide whether he nonetheless verifies the accuracy of the data in the VAT return.
c) The value of goods acquired from other Member States, which the Czech taxpayer entered in the relevant lines of the VAT return, is higher than the value of the supplied goods declared by EC taxpayers.
Here again, the tax administrator is free to decide whether he verifies the accuracy of the data.
After the verifying the difference and clarifying the underlying reasons the tax administrator enters the results of the verification into ATIS.
The results of verification are transferred to the CLO.
The number of cases sent from the CLO to tax offices for review for the individual quarters of 2005 is illustrated in graph No. 1 (Note: source: MoF).
Graph No. 1 above documents that the number of cases sent from the CLO to tax offices for the individual quarters of 2005 decreased.
There was a substantial decrease in the number of the 4th quarter of 2005, because the CLO increased the minimal financial limit, i.a., with respect to the possibility of sending a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Discrepancies between data in the VAT returns and data from the EC need not always to be caused by an error on the part of the domestic taxpayer.
It may also be attributable to an error on the part of the EC taxpayer or an error that occurred because some types of supplies may be entered in the RS differently in the individual EC Member States.
The most common reasons for discrepancies in the values of reported transactions revealed at the audited tax offices are given in Table No. 1.
Submitting and processing of recapitulative statements in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions are required to file quarterly RS in that the intra-Community deliveries per recipient are listed (Â§ 18a (1) UStG).
The RS must be filed until the 10th day of the month following the respective calendar quarter.
If extension is granted for the preliminary VAT returns, this also applies to the RS.
The RS needs to be delivered to the CLO.
Starting from 1 January 2007 they have to be delivered electronically.
The competent tax offices may grant exceptions to certain taxpayers to avoid undue hardships.
In cases where taxpayers realise that the RS was wrong they are obliged to submit a corrected statement within one month.
If taxpayers failed to submit an RS the CLO will initiate a procedure to ensure submission of the statement.
This procedure includes: â first reminder â second reminder linked with the threat of a fine and â imposing the fine.
Although the German Fiscal Code permits imposing a fine up to EUR 25,000 (Â§ 329 AO), the CLO assesses fines in three steps in the amounts of EUR 125, 250 and 500.
Besides this, Â§ 26a (1) Nr. 5 UStG stipulates that taxpayers act illegally if they intentionally or carelessly do not issue a RS properly, state it incompletely or not in time or if they do not amend a RS at all or not in time.
This offence can be sanctioned by a fine up to EUR 5,000.
Data on intra-Community supplies cannot be entered into VIES by the tax office because processing of RS is an exclusive task of the CLO.
RS data are stored in the system of the CLO only.
So the figures of the RS are visible to the tax office only after their processing at the CLO.
The deadlines for processing RS are set forth in the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Data of the RS have to be stored within three months after the respective calendar quarter.
In case of erroneous VAT IDs in the RS of German taxpayers the CLO gets an O_MCTL from the other Member State.
The CLO contacts the entrepreneur and asks for the accurate data.
If the CLO does not succeed in getting the correct information the case is handed over to the competent tax offices.
It is now their turn to ask for the correct data.
The BRH found out that most of the entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID on request of the CLO.
However, the reminder, the threat and the assessment of three additional fines take too much time in cases where a taxpayer may be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.
Those cases that were finally reported to the competent tax offices, were usually completed within one or two months.
The tax office refused the tax exemption of the declared intra-Community supplies in 73 % of these cases.
If taxpayers submitted the right VAT ID the tax office asked them to submit a corrected RS to the CLO, because the tax offices are not able to correct the VIES data by themselves.
The BRH found that neither the tax offices nor the CLO monitored the submission of the corrected RS. So often taxpayers did not comply with the request.
Due to the fact that the CLO does not have access to the VAT return data a comparison of the data on supply of goods declared in the VAT return and in the RS does not take place before submitting those data to the CLO of the other Member States.
This check is possible only for the tax offices and is usually made when preparing a VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States are processed in the CLO.
Incorrect VAT IDs are selected and submitted to the respective Member States.
The data are used for purposes of acquisition control in the tax offices.
As soon as they are in the system the CLO checks them against the data of previous calendar quarters.
In cases that comply with certain criteria (see 5.2) control information is created and sent to the competent tax offices.
This is done permanently whereas a compilation of the acquisition data for all taxpayers is created later and submitted to the tax offices.
The RMS installed for the assessment procedure then checks those data against the data of intraCommunity acquisitions.
This system completely covers those entrepreneurs, who are not fully entitled to VAT deduction.
Comparison and evaluation
In the CR, taxpayers that delivered intra-Community supplies to a person registered for VAT in another Member State, submit a RS within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter to a competent local tax office.
Tax offices process RS and transmit the data to the CLO.
Values of intra-Community supplies, stated by taxpayers in the RS, are compared by the tax offices with the values of intraCommunity supplies, stated by the same taxpayers in VAT returns.
Results of the comparison are used as part of assessment proceedings.
In Germany, taxpayers that performed intra-Community supplies are obliged to submit quarterly RS within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter.
Taxpayers submit the RS to the CLO, as from 1 January 2007 electronically.
For tax offices, the data from RS are at disposal only after their processing at the CLO.
Taxpayers both from the CR and Germany declare in RS only supplies of goods.
Rendering of services is not stated in RS.In contrast to the Czech tax offices the German tax offices are not able to correct wrong lines in a submitted RS by themselves.
Owing to this limited access to the German VIES data wrong VAT IDs were not corrected even if taxpayers communicated the right VAT ID to the tax office.
The German tax administration does not compare the data of intra-Community supplies that are declared in a German taxpayerâs VAT return with his RS.
Differences between the data of these two returns are usually not detected before the German CLO submits the VIES data to other Member States.
Considering these findings of the BRH it is obvious that a comparison would increase the reliability of the submitted VIES data.
Data on supply of goods for the Czech taxpayers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the CR with data on acquisition of goods as stated in the Czech taxpayersÂ´ VAT returns.
Comparison is made by CLO separately for each calendar quarter.
The most important deviations are transmitted to the tax offices for review.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German one does not generally check the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such a general verification is carried out only for taxpayers, which are not fully entitled to deduct input VAT.
Furthermore, the German tax administration checks the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxpayers only if the RMS produces an inspection note or if taxpayers are selected for an audit at any rate.
This process disburdens the tax offices to clarify the reasons of any difference.
On the other hand the disclosure of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
Combating carousel fraud requires continually updated information about intra-Community acquisitions.
The current system of RS, especially VIES, provides the tax authorities with information which may even be six months old.
This time lag could be shortened by up to four months if taxpayers had to submit a monthly RS.
The monthly submission would not be a considerable increase in bureaucratic costs because most of the taxpayers in CR and Germany are obliged to submit monthly VAT returns anyway â and the RS do not require any further information than the VAT return.
To avoid any bureaucratic costs the submission of the RS could be connected with the submission of VAT returns.
However, an obligation to submit monthly RS would cause more temporary mismatches between the declaration of intra-Community supplies and intra-Community acquisitions and it would increase the data ï¬ows between CLO.
In 2006 the German Federal Government considered the general institution of monthly RS.
The implementation failed because of doubts of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly submission of VIES data to CLOs of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In fact â if the obligation of monthly RS and the monthly submission of VIES data should be effective â a monthly update of VIES would require a European standard of monthly RS.
Statistical information on supply and acquisition of goods between the CR and Germany
As regards foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the CR.
The total quantities of intra-Community transactions in goods between the CR and Germany are set forth in Table No. 2.
The two SAI requested data on the number of erroneous IDs or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports transferred between the CR and Germany for the individual quarterly periods reviewed.
These data are contained in the following tables.
They show significant differences.
The reason of these differences may be a different basis for calculation of numbers of O_MCTL reports.
While the Czech CLO relates its numbers to the respective calendar quarter, for which RS were submitted, the German CLO relates its numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
International exchange of information in the CR: Procedure
International exchange of information helps tax administrators to obtain information from other Member States related to intra-Community business transactions and the taxpayers who carried out these transactions.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 makes a distinction between two basic categories of exchange of information: exchange of information on request and exchange of information without a prior request.
International exchange of information on request is performed through a ârequest for informationâ (hereinafter âRFIâ) using the standardised SCAC form.
Tax administrators in the CR communicate their RFI or answer a delivered RFI via the financial directorate to the CLO, which provides for translation of information entered in the standardised SCAC forms into the foreign language and their sending to other Member States.
The CLO also provides for receipt of RFI from other Member States and answers to sent RFI, their translation into Czech and distribution to the competent local tax administrators for processing.
Art. 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 stipulates that the maximum period of time for processing RFI is 3 months from receipt of the request.
All RFI submitted during the audited period between the CR and Germany were subjected to SAO audit.
Out of the total number of 94 RFI received in the CR from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the set three-month deadline; a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were processed after this deadline and, in the remaining 1 case, an answer had not been sent to Germany by the time of the SAO audit.
More detailed information on the periods of time within which answers to RFI received from Germany were sent from the CR is contained in Graph No. 2.
Of the total number of 335 RFI sent from the CR to Germany, an answer was sent in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) within the set three-month deadline, a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) of requests were answered after this deadline and, in 19 cases, an answer had not been sent from Germany at the time of the SAO audit (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to identify on the basis of the data provided when the answer was delivered from Germany).
More detailed information on the periods of time within which answers to RFI were furnished from Germany to the CR is contained in Graph No. 3.
The percentages of the values of intra-Community transactions stated in RFI submitted between the CR and Germany are disclosed in Graph No. 4.
The above graph illustrates that the value of business transactions reviewed through RFI was most frequently in the range above EUR 60,000.
International exchange of information without a prior request occurs either by means of automatic or structured-automatic exchange of information, or by spontaneous exchange of information.
Tax administrators from other Member States often received information that might be important for VAT administration without a previous request.
In the CR, all the information is collected at the CLO.
Information is transferred electronically between the individual Member States.
âAutomatic exchangeâ pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 refers to systematic communication of prespecified information to other Member States, without a prior request and at preset regular intervals.
âStructured-automatic exchangeâ refers to systematic communication of pre-specified information to other Member States without a previous request as soon as the relevant information is available.
The CR provides other Member States with information on supply of new means of transport via automatic exchange.
This information is available for the tax administrator from the form Report of the supply of a new means of transport pursuant to Â§ 19 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the issued tax document.
In processing this form, the tax administrator enters the necessary data in a specially created template and immediately submits this to the contact employee at the financial directorate, where these data are collected and submitted to the CLO for subsequent processing. Then they are transferred to other Member States within a set deadline, i.e. by the latest within two months after the end of the quarter in which these data were available.
The CR also provides the other Member States with information on mail-order sales, which are exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on operations within the EC that seem unauthorised and information on potential âmissing tradersâ.
Such information is sent to other Member States via spontaneous exchange using a SCAC form.
International exchange of information in Germany: Procedure
In Germany the local tax office in charge initiates both requests for information and spontaneous information.
The tax office sends the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which transmits the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The tax offices are instructed to write their requests for information or their spontaneous information only in German; even the used SCAC form is monolingual.
Half of the German requests for information checked by the BRH were sent to ensure the taxation of an intra-Community acquisition in the other Member State and prove the tax exemption of the intra-Community supply from Germany to the other Member State respectively.
When the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks the amount of supplies mentioned in the request for the minimum threshold of EUR 15,000.
If there is no adequate reason for the request, the German CLO declines any request for an amount below this threshold.
Furthermore, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are neither in German nor English.
To answer the requests for information the CLO sends the request to the tax office in charge referring to the 3-month-time-limit.
There are no other deadlines set for processing the request on specific organisational levels of the tax administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical conditions to monitor the elapsed time limits, it lacks the staff capacity to remind the tax offices of answering the incomplete requests for information.
The tax offices get the information required by sending a letter to the taxpayers or by conducting an audit.
The auditors usually chose between two different types of audits: A special VAT audit which covers any taxable process of a period of some months or a so called VAT inspection which can cover only one transaction which has been done recently.
This short and ï¬exible kind of audit does not require any notification of the taxpayer and it has been of merits to investigate a single taxable transaction.
In the context of the automatic exchange without a prior request Germany provides other Member States with information â about VAT IDs granted to entrepreneurs who are resident in other EC Member States, â about the refund of input tax to those entrepreneurs who are resident in other EC Member States.
Furthermore, Germany has committed itself to providing other EC Member States with the following information through a structured automatic exchange:
a. The supply of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without using their VAT ID, b. supplies by distance or catalogue selling to other Member States which are not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between the intra-Community acquisitions declared by a taxpayer and the VIES data submitted by other Member States, d. intra-Community supplies of goods which the German taxpayer did not report in RS, because the supplies were treated as domestic transactions, e. potential âmissing traderâ which made intra-Community transactions independent of the validity of their VAT ID and f. entrepreneurs who supplied goods to potential âmissing tradersâ or recipients who misused their VAT ID.
Comparison and evaluation
Sending of RFI or spontaneous information is initiated both in the CR and Germany by competent local tax offices that send filed SCAC forms to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (CzechEnglish) and translates dispatched information into English or German language, respectively, German tax offices comply with the instruction, according to which they have to write RFI or spontaneous information exclusively in German on a single-language form.
The German CLO does not provide a translation of German texts.
When reviewing RFIs transmitted between the CR and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the SAO found that the Czech tax administration settled 74,5 % of received RFIs in a given three months deadline, while RFIs sent to Germany were settled by the German tax administration in the given deadline in 40,6 % cases only.
Although the German CLO refers the tax offices to the 3-month-deadline it does not monitor the elapsed time limits.
The outcome of the missing reminders is the high quantity of delayed answers to RFIs.
Because of these problems the BRH recommended a steady reminding exercise of the CLO.
The situation has already improved.
According to our latest information the German CLO now reminds the Tos tax offices of answering the incompleted requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the CR
In the CR, several units at various organisational levels of the tax administration are concerned with VAT risk management.
Within the MoF, the following units are concerned with the aspect of risk management and combating VAT fraud:
VAT Methodology and Performance Department and, in its framework, the VAT Risk Management Unit that, i.a., manages the selection of risks of potential tax evasion and evaluates trends in these risks at a domestic and community level.
Nationally it coordinates the performance of the task of âTrustworthiness of VAT returnsâ and VIES data utilisation from the standpoint of tax evasion as part of intra-Community transactions.
On the basis of data on the trade balance of the CR it evaluates risky commodities, prepares VAT risk management conceptually and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and with other Member States.
The Department of International Cooperation in VAT Administration that, i.a., provides for exchange of information in the area of VAT, participates in the creation and maintenance of an information database, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, provides for informing the public and for other forms of international cooperation in the sense of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The two SAI requested data on the number of erroneous IDs or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports transferred between the CR and Germany for the individual quarterly periods reviewed.
These data are contained in the following tables.
They show significant differences.
The reason of these differences may be a different basis for calculation of numbers of O_MCTL reports.
While the Czech CLO relates its numbers to the respective calendar quarter, for which RS were submitted, the German CLO relates its numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.
The Methodology of Tax Control and Investigation Department that, i.a., performs risk analysis as part of methodological management of tax audits and, in accordance with risk analysis, establishes priorities for orientation of tax audits in the plans of the financial directorates, prepares risk analyses as part of reducing tax evasions including the collection of information obtained in tax administration and from other sources and proposes measures to reduce tax evasion.
Investigation departments are established at the financial directorates and, i.a., look for tax entities and high-risk areas regarding tax fraud (i.e. internet business, gold, pharmaceutical industry), look for unregistered tax entities from the standpoint of tax evasion (e.g. in the area of internet services, mediation of work, radio and printing services, etc.), analysis of connections in chain frauds and provision of information to local financial authorities.
Specialised audit departments have been established at 12 selected tax offices.
They have regional competence and perform tax audits outside the territorial competence of the tax offices on the basis of authorization.
The need to establish specialised tax audit departments followed from the increasing number of determined new and advanced types of tax evasions that occurred particularly amongst entities connected in chains.
This department concentrates on audit of tax entities according to the requirements of the investigation departments, tax entities with specific activities and international companies and tax entities with a large scope of activities as regards the magnitude of turnover.
The following mechanisms used to reduce risks in the area of VAT were integrated into the ATIS system: â the task âTrustworthiness of VAT returnsâ for evaluating the risk level of submitted tax returns, â the task âChoice of tax entities for inspectionâ, enabling selection of taxpayers for audit on the basis of selected criteria, â the task âVIESâ, through which the tax administrators have access to data provided from the other EC Member States.
The task âVIESâ permits, i.a.: â verifying the validity of VAT ID of taxpayers from other Member States, â obtaining from other Member States the value of goods supplied to a Czech taxpayer, declared in the RS by all its suppliers in other Member States, â generating a list of taxpayers who did not submit RS, â performance of formal control of data that taxpayers in the CR entered in RS prior to sending these data to other Member States, â generating a list of taxpayers for which data on supply of goods to other Member States entered in their VAT returns does not coincide with RS data, â generating a list of taxpayers, for which the value of goods acquired from other Member States entered in VAT returns do not coincide with the data declared in the RS of all his suppliers from other Member States.
As part of activities to reduce the risk of tax evasion, tax staff have access to the registers of the state administrative authorities, such as the commercial index, real estate register, motor vehicle register, business license register, etc.
More detailed information is provided in Chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the CR.
Risk management in Germany
Because of the federal structure in Germany both the federal tax administration (in particular the CLO) and the tax administrations of the 16 federal states participate in the development and the operation of RMSs.
Although there are joint working groups for the development neither the CLO nor the tax administrations of the federal states share a completely consistent database.
At the level of the CLO unit ST I 2 (hereinafter the âKUSSâ â coordination unit for special VAT audits and tax investigations) collects audit findings on tax fraud in a separate database called OPUS.
KUSS established another database called ZAUBER in cooperation with the tax offices to communicate the names of discovered âmissing tradersâ or VAT fraudsters.
KUSS coordinates both connected cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.
The experience gathered by KUSS is incorporated into the development of RMS in the working groups.
Furthermore, experts of several other units of the CLO and the MoF are entrusted with RMS duties and responsibilities.
At the level of the CLO, a formal control is done of the composition of VAT IDs of other Member States in submitted RS of German taxpayers.
This formal control is processed before RS data are submitted to other Member States to improve the clarity and use of the VIES data submitted (see 4.4.2).
The verification of VAT IDs mentioned in RS is proven on the basis of O_MCTL-Codes submitted by other Member States (for the process of correcting an invalid VAT ID see also 4.4.2).
Furthermore, the RMS of the CLO is based on the VIES data transmitted by other Member States and it creates several types of inspection notes based on several characteristics usually found in carousel transactions to detect a potential âmissing traderâ.
The tax offices of the federal states are instructed to process these inspection notes and in some cases to report the result of their investigation to the CLO.
The audit findings of the BRH confirmed that it is necessary to include all available characteristics in order to be able to assume a case of tax fraud with a sufficient probability (instead of focussing on a companyâs turnover only).
So the BRH suggested to the MoF to imply a mix of diverse characteristics for producing the reports.
The RMS should include other facts like the taxpayerâs payment behaviour, the (economic) branch or the shareholders.
A second level of RMS is processed by the tax administrations of the federal states and focuses on processing of VAT returns.
RMS for example generates a list of those taxpayers who declared intra-Community supplies in their VAT returns.
This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the complete submission of RS.
Furthermore, this type of RMS compares the intra-Community acquisitions declared in the taxpayerâs annual VAT return with the data of the VIES-system.
The tax administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data because this comparison would disclose too many mismatches which may attributed to other reasons than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:
â differing times when the supplier and the acquirer thought the intra-Community transaction was carried out;
â differing accounting and declaring of sales discounts and incentives.
In addition to comparing the VAT return data and VIES data many federal states implemented components of RMS based on the data of VAT returns, and some other facts (like the composition of the firmâs name, the age of the shareholders, the number of employees and the taxpayerâs payment behaviour).
Bavaria implemented a rule-based RMS, permitting a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter the risk managers) to program their own rules to identify potential tax fraudsters.
This RMS is applied when the tax offices are processing the monthly VAT return.
So the tax office in charge receives suspected cases of the RMS before the VAT is fixed.
Since this RMS is not able to learn the risk managers have to adjust the rules on the basis of the feedback of the tax offices.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has programmed an adaptive neural network with the data of tax files in which an audit disclosed tax evasions.
Based on these data the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The RMS produces a list of tax files monthly, which are suspected of being involved in tax evasion.
On the basis of this list the tax offices in charge decide to audit the proposed taxpayers.
After the audit the auditors have to report their findings, so the RMS can learn from the results of its list.
North-Rhine Westphalia uses an adaptive neural network which is combined with a rule-based fuzzy-system.
Based on many data of assessed VAT returns and some other facts this neuro-fuzzy- or data mining system calculates the probability that a taxpayer is involved in tax fraud.
Afterwards it produces a monthly list of potential tax fraudsters.
Based on this list the local tax offices choose relevant taxpayers for an audit and report the audit findings to the data processing centre.
The implementation of any of these three RMS in other federal states is in progress.
Since none of these three RMS is based on the same approach a combination of all the systems seems to be useful for tackling tax fraud.
It will remain to be seen if such a system achieves the expected results.
Comparison and evaluation
Although specific criteria of the RMS of CR and Germany could not be discussed in this report, the SAO and the BRH found that each Member State developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches of the three federal states in Germany the RMS of each European state has its own strengths and weaknesses.
The tax authorities of the European Member States currently discuss new tendencies and new models of crossborder VAT fraud.
VAT fraud â especially carousel fraud â did not turn out to be a national but a European problem rather.
Taxpayers involved in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State but in several states.
An effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State only.
Successful criteria, components or approaches of a RMS have to be exchanged and implemented in each Member State of the EC, if not so fraudsters will choose that Member State with the weakest RMS.
VAT loss caused by the Europe-wide fraud need not to affect the Member State of the initiator of the fraud.
Each Member State that is involved in the fraudulent activities can be affected.
So there should be a European exchange and discussion of RMS.
Selected audit findings on verification of commercial transactions
As part of the parallel audits the SAO and BRH reviewed the quality and use of information on selected business transactions that were subject to international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the CR and Germany.
In addition, the two audit institutions jointly reviewed several business transactions where there were doubts about their execution or discrepancies in the manner in which taxpayers in the two countries reported such business transactions in their VAT returns or RS.
At the request of the BRH, the SAO reviewed a total of 8 cases related to business transactions performed between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.
In addition, in 43 cases, on the basis of notification by the BRH, the SAO reviewed the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, reported by Czech taxpayers in their tax returns and RS.
Upon request from the SAO, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 cases related to business transactions performed between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.
Relevant information was exclusively exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 using official communication by the CLO.
The review of those selected cases revealed, i.a. that, the different ways of registration in the EC Member States cause problems as mentioned in chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the data from VIES, in the 3rd quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer acquired goods from a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 60,500.
When the Czech taxpayer declared acquisition of goods at a value corresponding to only EUR 29,869 the Czech tax administration sent a request to Germany for verification of the value of the supplied goods.
The German party stated in the answer to the RFI delivered from Germany that, in the 2nd quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer supplied goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of EUR 27,381, in the 3rd quarter at a value of EUR 31,997 and, in the 4th quarter, at a value of EUR 10,276.
It further followed from the answer that the VAT ID of the German taxpayer was valid only from 28 September 2004 but, on the basis of an additional request by the German taxpayer for certification of the validity of VAT ID, in 2006 the German CLO retroactively issued a certificate with validity of the VAT ID from 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer corrected the RS.
On the basis of this information, this was a case of acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
Through an inquiry at the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, on the basis of an investigation by the tax administrator, the Czech taxpayer submitted additional VAT returns for the individual taxable periods in 2004, in which he increased the value of the goods acquired from other Member States and simultaneously made claims for deduction of VAT on acquisition of goods from other Member States.
However, the Czech tax administrator could not unambiguously determine from these additional VAT returns whether they also include the value of supplies from the above-mentioned German supplier.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the German supplier was registered for VAT in September 2003.
However, because he did not request the allocation of a VAT ID on registration, he was allocated only an identification number for transactions in Germany.
Although it is not usually possible to allocate a taxpayer a VAT ID retroactively in Germany, in this case, in 2006 the German tax official assigned to this German taxpayer a VAT ID retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO allocates a VAT ID retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delay of the allocation; for example if the CLO caused the delay after the taxpayerâs application of a VAT ID.
In this case the CLO allocates VAT ID retroactively because the entrepreneur does not provide an own valid VAT ID for an intra-Community supply according to Â§ 6 UStG.
Vice versa a German recipient does not provide a valid VAT ID of his supplier to declare an intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these different processes between the Member States the German CLO allocated VAT ID retroactively in this special case.
2.
As part of international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator requested review of the VAT registration of the German taxpayer.
VIES gives a registration date of 5 March 2005, while the date 1 October 2004 is given in the certificate of registration of the German taxpayer issued by the competent local German tax office.
The German authorities stated in the answer sent from Germany that the German tax entity was registered on 1 October 2004, but that, for organisational reasons, he was allocated a VAT ID in Germany only on 16 February 2005.
Through a question sent to the competent local tax administrator, the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator performed a VAT audit at the Czech taxpayer for the taxation periods of the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 2nd quarter of 2005.
In this audit, the tax office found that the Czech taxpayer included in his VAT return services at a value of CZK 9,897 (EUR 314), provided to the German taxpayer prior to his VAT registration (i.e. prior to 1 October 2004).
The tax office subsequently assessed VAT of CZK 1,880 (EUR 60) for the tax entity for the taxation period of the 3rd quarter of 2004.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the VAT ID was allocated to the German taxpayer only on 16 February 2005, when he informed the tax office about his business which was started in 2004.
Furthermore the tax office registered him retroactively for VAT as 1 October 200415 to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return of the year 2004.
In this VAT return the taxpayer declared intra-Community acquisitions from CR in the amount of EUR 160 (Â» CZK 5,000).
3. In the VAT return for September 2004 and RS for the 3rd quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer declared the supply of goods at a value of CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) to a German taxpayer.
In reviewing the registration of the German taxpayer in the VIES system, the Czech tax administrator found that his registration was valid from 11 November 2004, i.e. after supply of the goods to Germany by the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return, in which he declared a tax base for performed domestic supplies at a value of CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) and VAT of CZK 21,777 (EUR 692), which he paid.
Through a question to the competent local tax office in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently submitted a request for renewal of the proceedings in the matter of the additional VAT return and, as evidence, submitted the statement of the German tax administration that the German taxpayer had been registered for taxes since 1 January 2000.
Consequently, the Czech tax administrator reviewed the validity of registration of the German taxpayer as part of international exchange of information.
It followed from the answer delivered from Germany that the German taxpayer was allocated a VAT ID only on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of supply of the goods.
Consequently, the tax administrator in the CR rejected the request for renewal of the proceedings.
The BRH found that, in this case, intra-Community acquisition of goods was not involved because the German taxpayer obtained a VAT ID only on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient declared the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and he declared VAT on this intra-Community acquisition, as he demanded the refund of the input VAT in the same amount.
Since there would be no change in VAT value that the German taxpayer would be obliged to pay, the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the data in his VAT return.
The BRH further found that the name of the German taxpayer mentioned in the RFI was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, as a consequence of which there was confusion between two German tax entities.
This change of the name of the German taxpayer also confused the Czech tax administrator.
4.
As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administrator reviewed the acquisition of goods by a Czech taxpayer in the 1st quarter of 2005, at a value of EUR 22,686 from a German taxpayer.
Through an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that this administrator performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer in which he reviewed whether the supply of the goods was performed and whether the Czech taxpayer entered the invoice for these goods in the accounts and paid it.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of the goods in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID in the tax document, but only the tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
In the VIES application, the Czech tax administrator found that the German taxpayer was registered for VAT for intra-Community transactions only from 21 April 2005, i.e. after performance of the supply to the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech tax administrator also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the certificate of registration of the German taxpayer so that, if required, he could take steps to assess taxes.
The Czech tax office assessed this business transaction as acquisition of goods from a nontaxpayer in Germany and thus did not subsequently assess taxes for the Czech taxpayer from this business transaction.
The BRH found that, according to the German legislation, for a taxpayer supplying goods to other Member States there is no need for a VAT ID ensuring that intra-Community supplies of goods are exempt from VAT.
The supplier must only have the VAT ID of the acquirer in the other Member State and must be capable of demonstrating transport of the given goods to the other Member State.
Thus, according to the German VAT law, this was an intra-Community transaction and VAT should be assessed in the CR.
Anyway it is important that the Czech tax administrator took note of this transaction because the supply of a machine of that value was not the German supplierâs core business.
As described in chapter 4.6.2 the German CLO declines to answer RFIs which are applied to intra-Community transactions if the amount is less than the minimum threshold of EUR 15,000:
5. According to VIES data in the 3rd quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer acquired goods from the German taxpayer at a value of EUR 12,561.
The Czech tax administrator performed a tax audit of the tax entity for this taxable period.
As part of international cooperation, the Czech tax administration requested review of supply of these goods via a SCAC form.
The Czech taxpayer stated that he did not receive the goods, that he had never done business with the German company and that the acquisition of these goods was not entered in his accounts.
The German tax administration rejected the request for provision of evidence â contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents, stating that the turnover did not exceed the amount of EUR 15,000 and no other explanations were given.
As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain any evidence for retrospective tax assessment on the goods acquired, the tax audit ended without any findings and the tax liability remained assessed in the original amount.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as a âfiscal representativeâ (Â§ 22 (a) â (e) UStG).
The German taxpayer reported these supplies in its annual VAT return and in the RS.
His right to exemption of the supplies was recognised.
On the basis of notification by the BRH, the German tax office will send documents to the CR, required for subsequent assessment of taxes on the acquired goods.
It was shown in chapter 4.6.1 that replies to RFIs sent by the German tax administration exceeded the 3-monthtime limit more often than replies of the Czech tax administration:
6. SAO found in the audit that, on 5 October 2005 the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany, related to reviewing the value of goods supplied in the 4th quarter of 2004.
In the RS for this period, the German taxpayer declared supply of goods to the Czech taxpayer in the value of EUR 86,307; however, for the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared in the VAT return only the acquisition of goods for a value corresponding to EUR 35,314.
In the answer to the RFI delivered to the CR on 9 May 2006, i.e. following expiry of the deadline for processing, stipulated in Art. 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German party stated that the request could not be processed, as the operation of the German company was terminated at the end of 2005.
Since the German tax administration did not comply with the deadline for processing the RFI, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for the tax proceedings in the CR.
7. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested - via a SCAC form - review of a supply of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 1,265,554, performed in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2004 since the transaction showed characteristics of carousel fraud.
The SAO found that an answer to the RFI had not been received from Germany at the time of the audit.
Through an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer did not include in his VAT return the supplies of new means of transportation for this German taxpayer at a value of CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 37 5,472).
The Czech tax administrator corrected the tax return information and the Czech tax entity submitted a corrected RS.
On the basis of the request by the SAO, the BRH found that, for technical reasons, the German CLO did not transfer this RFI to the competent local tax office for review.
Following notification by the BRH, an audit was performed at the German acquirer in Germany, which provided evidence that the acquisition of all the automobiles was properly taxed and that the relevant automobiles were sold to other taxpayers in Germany.
8. According to VIES data in the 4th quarter of 2004 the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car from the German taxpayer, at a value of EUR 48,500.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare acquisition of these goods.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer has not submitted a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech taxpayer did not submit tax returns even after being invited to do so by the tax administrator; consequently, on 23 May 2005, the tax office assessed VAT for the period from October to December 2004 in the amount of CZK 0.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO referred to this supply from a German taxpayer.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the administrator sent a RFI to Germany in relation to the above-mentioned supply.
As the answer to the RFI was delivered only on 7 February 2007, it was not known by the time of completion of the SAOâs audit in which way the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained by international exchange.
Because of failure to comply with obligations following from the Act on VAT, registration for VAT was cancelled for the Czech taxpayer as of 23 August 2005.
In some cases only a partial reply was sent because the audit carried out by tax offices at taxpayers was not finished at the time of the audit of the SAO and BRH:
9.
In 2005, through a SCAC form, the Czech tax administrator requested review of supply of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 16,991 performed in the 3rd quarter of 2004, showing the characteristics of carousel fraud.
In his answer to the RFI, the German tax administrator stated that he had available only the invoices issued by the Czech taxpayer for supplies at a value of EUR 16,335.
On the basis of the request from the SAO, the BRH found that the audit performed by the German tax office at the acquirer in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the acquisition of goods at a value of EUR 16,335 twice, in the tax returns for the months of August and September 2004.
10.
In 2005, through a SCAC form, the Czech tax administrator requested review of supplies of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 198,167, performed in the 4th quarter of 2004 and 1st quarter of 2005, showing the characteristics of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial answer to the RFI to the CR, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer acquired several automobiles and further stated that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The SAO found that the competent local tax office performed several local investigations at the Czech supplier for the purpose of reviewing the claim of excessive VAT deductions, in which it did not find unauthorised claiming.
The BRH found that in this period the German taxpayer declared in his VAT returns the acquisition of goods from other Member States with a total value of EUR 579,114 and that the audit performed by the German tax office at the acquirer in Germany has still not yet been completed.
In chapter 4.4.1 the reasons of mismatches between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipientâs VAT return and the data of the RS of the supplier are described.
The audited cases showed that temporary mismatches or the improper declaration of a transaction as an intra-Community supply of goods in RS were not the most frequent causes for the deviations:
11.
According to data from the VIES system, in the 1st quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer allegedly acquired goods at a value of EUR 35,716 from the German taxpayer; however, the Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech taxpayer failed to cooperate with the tax administrator and no activities were performed in the registered seat of the company, the Czech tax administrator requested, as part of international exchange of information, review of the way in which the German taxpayer communicated with the Czech taxpayer.
The answer to the RFI delivered from Germany showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax entity was unknown at the address communicated and an agreed transporter accepted the goods.
The order was for the total sum of EUR 155,000 but the German taxpayer supplied only goods at a value of EUR 21,659.
The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer false confirmation of payment of the sum of EUR 155,153 in favour of the German taxpayer.
Following identification of the fraudulent conduct on the part of the Czech acquirer, the German taxpayer managed to reobtain the supplied material, with the assistance of his other Czech customers, with the exception of one item at a value of EUR 7,916.
Through an inquiry at the competent local tax office in the CR, the SAO found that the tax administration, i.a., on the basis of the obtained information, subsequently assessed the Czech taxpayer VAT for the goods acquired from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).
On the basis of an inquiry from the SAO, the BRH confirmed that, following corrections, the German supplier declared supply of goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of only EUR 7,916.
According to the German legal situation the German taxpayer declared the reclaim of the goods and the reduction of the taxable amount in the quarter of the reclaim.
So his RS contained the following declarations concerning the Czech taxpayer:
12.
As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administration requested, through a SCAC form, review of supply of goods and provision of services, performed in the 3rd quarter of 2005.
According to this RFI in this period, the Czech taxpayer had supplied goods to the German taxpayer at a total value of EUR 396,126 and had provided services at a value of EUR 11,885.
The SAO found that the Czech tax administration performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer for the purpose of reviewing this supply.
In response to the RFI, the Czech tax administration stated that the Czech taxpayer supplied the German taxpayer with a production line, including assembly.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production line prior to accession of the CR to the EC and the line was assembled after May 1, 2004 on the basis of an order.
The German taxpayer did not accept the assembled line because of asserted defects.
In the 3rd quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer issued an invoice to the German taxpayer for the sum of EUR 107,100 for assembly and EUR 11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer accepted the invoices, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
Through an inquiry at the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that all the invoices were properly entered in the accounts of the Czech taxpayer.
VAT returns for the 3rd quarter of 2005 contain only those amounts that were documented by the Czech taxpayer and that were related to invoicing after May 1, 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the answer from the Czech tax administration, the competent local tax office arrived at the conclusion that those transactions were a consistent supply of goods from the Czech taxpayer to the German taxpayer including the service of the assembly.
In this special case, the place of this so-called work supply is where the production line is assembled.
The German recipient of the work supply is obliged to pay the VAT according to the German VAT law.
Simultaneously, the recipient may apply for deduction of VAT in the same amount.
As there would be no changes in the VAT value that the German taxpayer would be obliged to pay, corrections in the tax return were neglected by the German tax office.
13. According to VIES data, in February 2005 Czech taxpayer A purchased a machine from German taxpayer C at a value of EUR 58,000.
The Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany for review of this information.
In answer to the RFI, the German party stated that German taxpayer C supplied that machine to Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but that he returned the machine to German taxpayer C in October 2004.
According to the information of the German tax administration, the machine was not transferred back to Germany, but was transported to the organisational unit of German taxpayer C in the CR.
It further followed from the answer to the RFI that, in February 2005, German taxpayer C sold the machine to Czech taxpayer A.
This taxpayer received the machine in the seat of the organisational unit of the German taxpayer in the CR.
As the supply was performed only within the CR, this did not constitute an intra-Community supply of goods.
By means of a question to the tax administrator in charge of taxpayer B, the SAO found that according to VIES data, German taxpayer C supplied goods to Czech taxpayer B in the 3rd quarter of 2004 (another machine), at a value of EUR 88,027.
Taxpayer B stated that he did not receive these goods and these the competent local tax administrator in the CR sent a RFI to Germany.
According to the answer to this request, the machine was supplied.
In a further investigation at taxpayer B, the Czech tax administrator found that the machine at a value of EUR 88,027 was not entered in the accounts of taxpayer B and that this could be a machine of the same kind as was supplied by the organisational unit of German taxpayer C to Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
The SAO further found that the Czech tax administrator competent local for taxpayer A performed a local investigation concerning this taxpayer.
The tax administrator had the invoice of German taxpayer C of 7 February 2005, in which taxpayer A is stated as the customer for the machine.
The Czech tax administrator found that taxpayer A had not entered this invoice in his accounts.
Taxpayer A had concluded a leasing agreement with another Czech company, where the subject of the leasing was a machine of the same kind.
The leasing company supplied the machine on 9 February 2005 and the leasing company provided for the transport of the machine.
The Czech tax office failed to use the information contained in the answer to the request for information for assessing the tax obligation of taxpayer A.
The BRH found that German taxpayer C did not supply the machine at a value of EUR 88,027 to the CR, but to another German taxpayer D.
Thus, this did not constitute intra-Community supply of goods, but taxable supply in Germany.
Consequently, the German tax administrator did not recognise the claim of German taxpayer C to exemption from VAT and corrected the data in his tax return.
The German taxpayer D supplied the machine to the Czech taxpayer B.
According to the German legislation, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the CR.
BRH further found that, in his RS for the 1st quarter of 2005, German taxpayer C entered the supply of a machine at a value of EUR 58,000 to Czech taxpayer A.
This supply was not reviewed during the tax audit performed by the German tax office.
The following figure shows the contractual relationships between participants of the above mentioned business transactions.
14.
Auditing received RFIs, SAO found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech tax administration received an RFI from Germany, in which a German tax administrator requested confirmation of intra-Community supply from a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 879,680,625 to a Czech taxpayer.
According to the German tax administrator, there was a suspicion that that was a case of fictitious intra-Community supply of goods.
It was further stated in the RFI that the German taxpayer had not done any active business since 1999.
SAO stated that the Czech tax administrator performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer.
The executive of the Czech company stated that the above-mentioned case was probably a claim of the German taxpayer in relation to the German tax administration that was set up by the Czech taxpayer as a shareholder in the German company at the German tax office.
According to information provided to the SAO, to the present time the Czech tax administrator has not had any information that the German tax administration is processing the matter in relation to the Czech taxpayer.
The available information indicates that this was not a case of supply of goods; nonetheless, this value is still included in the VIES system as intra-Community supply of goods to a Czech taxpayer from Germany.
The most important reason for those discrepancies was that the recipients did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions in their tax returns (see also chapter 4.4.1):
15. According to the VIES data, a German taxpayer supplied goods to a Czech taxpayer in a total value of EUR 33,205 in the period from the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.
The Czech tax administrator requested review of the supply of the goods from Germany as part of international exchange of information.
In its answer to this request, the German party stated that the German taxpayer sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and that the Czech taxpayer picked up the remaining goods in person.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, prior to obtaining an answer to the RFI, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return for this period.
In spite of this submission, the differences in the acquisition values were not resolved and thus the Czech tax administrator recommended that a tax audit be performed at the Czech taxpayer.
The audit has not been carried out yet.
16. According to the data from VIES, in the 3rd quarter of 2004 a German taxpayer supplied to a Czech taxpayer goods at a value of EUR 46,854.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared intra-Community acquisition of goods only in an amount corresponding to the sum of EUR 14,856.
As part of international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator asked for a review of the amount of the actual supply.
In the response to this request delivered from Germany, 3 invoices were provided, with a total stated value of supplied goods of EUR 31,999, i.e. a value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer and the data in the VIES system.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, following receipt of the answer from Germany, the Czech tax administrator contacted the accountant of the Czech taxpayer and they agreed that, after reviewing these invoices with the owner of the company, she would discuss the submission of an additional VAT return for the 3rd quarter of 2004.
By now, the additional tax return was not submitted.
The Czech tax administrator informed the SAO that he would proceed so as to comply with the set deadlines for any retroactive assessment of VAT for the relevant taxation period.
17.
In the 4th quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer supplied goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of EUR 11,600.
As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administrator requested confirmation of whether the Czech taxpayer actually existed, because the alleged shareholder of the German taxpayer established a number of fictitious companies in Germany.
During reviewing of the business transaction by the tax office, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the acquisition of the goods.
However, according to a statement by the Czech taxpayer, the goods were not transported from Germany to the CR and were further sold in Germany during 2005.
The Czech taxpayer submitted documents on sale of the goods in January 2005.
The Czech taxpayer was not registered in Germany as a VAT payer and did not declare or pay taxes for the sale of the relevant goods neither in the CR nor Germany.
All these facts indicated tax evasion in the territory of Germany and the Czech tax administrator communicated these facts to the German tax administration in the answer to the RFI.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, on the basis of a performed investigation, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return for the 4th quarter of 2004, in which he included the value of goods acquired, i.a. from a German taxpayer and simultaneously exercised the right to tax deduction in acquisition of goods from other Member States.
He did not enter VAT on sale of goods in Germany to the Czech VAT return.
The Czech tax administrator assessed an additional VAT return following the local investigation without any changes.
According to the Czech legislation, the case in question did not consist in acquisition of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not sent or transported from another Member State to the CR.
Thus, the Czech tax administrator drew an erroneous conclusion in the local investigation.
The BRH found that, immediately after receiving the answer to the RFI, stating that the goods did not leave Germany, the German tax administrator corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and requested payment of VAT of EUR 1,600.
Furthermore, the competent tax office sent a hint to the tax office of the real recipient of the goods to ensure that the further sale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases taxpayers declared intra-Community transactions, which were probably not realised in fact:
18.
The Czech tax administrator obtained a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car at a value of EUR 47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
The request included an annex consisting in a copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer.
It also included a copy of the passport of the person who was said to have performed the transport of this automobile.
The Czech tax administrator found in the investigation that this was a stolen passport, that the person mentioned in it did not import any vehicle into the CR and he stated that he did not have any contacts with a German tax entity.
The Czech tax administrator never issued the certificate of VAT registration, whose copy was sent by the German party.
The Czech tax administrator entered these data in the answer to the RFI together with the fact that he cannot confirm the acquisition of the goods â the automobile in question.
Through a question to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer does not have his seat at the address listed in the Commercial Register and the executive of the company could not be contacted.
After performance of a tax objection proceeding for the taxation period of February 2005, the Czech tax administrator assessed the Czech taxpayer tax obligation in the amount of CZK 0.
In a further investigation, the Czech tax administrator found that the relevant automobile was sold to a further Czech entity, who purchased it through an Internet advertisement.
BRH found that, on the basis of the Czech answer to the RFI, the competent local German tax administrator did not recognise the claim of the German taxpayer to VAT exemption for this supply.
19. During an audit a German tax office was not able to clarify a difference of EUR 3,000 between the amount of acquired goods declared in the taxpayerâs tax return and the amount submitted from other Member States.
A Czech taxpayer was said to have supplied goods at a value of EUR 89,424 to a German taxpayer during the 4th quarter of 2004 and 1st quarter of 2005.
As the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not correspond to the data in VIES, the German tax administrator requested review of supplies and their payment as part of international exchange of information.
In the answer to the RFI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the single executive for the Czech company had been erased from the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and a new executive had not been entered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative to the shareholder in the Czech company.
The Czech taxpayer submitted a VAT return and a RS that, following deletion of the executive from the Commercial Register, was signed by an unauthorised person â this shareholder in the company.
The accountant of the Czech taxpayer told the tax administrator that the shareholder in the company deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR to the account of the company.
Cash documents were not drawn up.
Through an inquiry to the competent local tax office, the SAO in the CR found that the tax administrator recognised that the Czech taxpayer had the right to exemption from VAT for supply of goods to other Member States in the value of CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42,145) for the 1st quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 (EUR 47,548) for the 1st quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the VAT return of the German acquirer because a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer in the meantime.
Since the earlier audit did not detect any signs for tax fraud there would not be any chance to recover an assessed VAT liability.
20. According to VIES data in the year 2005 a German taxpayer acquired goods from CR in the amount of EUR 4,251,196 after he had acquired goods in the amount of EUR 43,274 in the previous year.
Neither in his VAT return of 2004 nor in his VAT return of 2005 did the German taxpayer declare intraCommunity acquisitions.
Furthermore, he did not declare any proportionate supplies.
Because of these differences the German tax office started an RFI concerning the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.
In the RS for these two quarters a Czech supplier declared intra-Community supplies of goods in a total value of CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5,615,299).
On 6 September 2006, the RFI was delivered, in which the German party requested review of whether the intra-Community supply declared by the Czech taxpayer had actually occurred.
In the answer to this RFI, the Czech tax administration stated that it was not possible to comply with the German request because the Czech taxpayer did not have an executive.
As can be seen from the documents provided to SAO by the relevant tax administrator, a protocol was drawn up with the executive of the Czech taxpayer on 30 March 2006 on commencement of VAT audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and for January to December 2005.
The taxpayer was simultaneously invited by the tax administrator to submit all the accounting and tax documents for that period, but he did not submit any documents.
According to the Commercial Register, the functional term of the sole executive ended as of 16 May 2005 but a new executive was not appointed.
The Czech taxpayer ceased submitting VAT returns in April 2006.
As part of this audit, the SAO reviewed jointly with the BRH several cases of intra-Community supplies performed between the CR and Germany that were not subject to previous exchange of information between the tax administrations of the two countries.
The two supreme audit institutions shared information on the reviewed cases via CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (eCR) which is not resident in Germany informed the competent tax office (Chemnitz-SÃ¼d) that it was going to accomplish taxable transactions in Germany.
Because of this information the company has been registered since June 2005 but it did not get a German VAT ID.
The (eCR) accepted an order of a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) to manufacture several wind power stations and to deliver those wind power stations on behalf, at risk and for account of the Danish customer to Austria.
For lack of sufficient capacities of its own the Czech company passed a part of the order to a German taxpayer (eD) who is resident in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relationships and the way of transport of the wind power stations:
According to the German legal situation the place of these transactions has to be determined as described in the following:
â The Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent the wind power stations for assembly in his name, at his risk and for his own account to Austria.
Because of the assembly his supply takes place in Austria â the supply of the wind power stations is taxable in Austria.
â Since the forwarding agent was instructed by the Danish entrepreneur (eDK) and the transport was on his behalf, on his risk and for his own account, the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) takes place where the transport started â in Germany.
Although the wind power stations have been sent to another EC Member State (A) and the recipient is a registered taxpayer of an EC Member State (CR) the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) could not gain any tax exemption because the EC Member State of destination differs from the EC Member State of the residence of the Czech company.
So this supply is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCR) deducted the input VAT in its tax returns.
The place of the supply of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by where the transport started.
However the transport of some wind power stations started in the CR and of some others in Germany.
â The supply of those wind power stations, which are manufactured in the CR, takes place in the CR.
â The supply of the other wind power stations, which are manufactured in Germany, takes place in Germany.
So the Czech company (eCR) delivered both intra-Community supplies from the CR to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that neither the Czech company (eCR) declared any intra-Community acquisitions in its German tax return nor submitted a RS to the German CLO.
So it may be possible that the Czech company declared all the intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the CR.
The SAO found that the eCR did not declare any intra-Community supplies to Austria but intra-Community supplies to Denmark.
To provide evidence for the taxation of the intra-Community acquisitions in Austria the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (the Austrian, the Czech, the Danish and the German) would be required although that case does not show any sign of tax fraud or of tax evasion.
Furthermore, the SAO and the BRH reviewed transactions to show the size of the differences between the declarations in the VAT return and the VIES data caused by the different legal provisions of VAT in 2004.
The reviewed cases demonstrate also that a change in these legal provisions takes time until the taxpayers and the tax offices apply the new legislation:
22. In the RS for the 2nd to 4th quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer declared supply of goods to a German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 792,977,452 (EUR 25,197,885).
In the same period, another Czech taxpayer declared in its RS intra-Community supplies to another German taxpayer in a total amount of CZK 18,157,265 (EUR 576,970).
Information provided to the SAO by the BRH indicated that both cases involved the supply of electrical energy.
Both Czech taxpayers stated the above-mentioned supplies in their RS in accordance with Act No. 235/2004 Coll., valid in 2004.
In a further review of these transactions, an audit group from the SAO found that there were differences in legislation on supply or acquisition of electrical energy between the CR and Germany in 2004.
While, in the CR, taxpayers declared the supply of electrical energy in accordance with the applicable statutory text of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as intra-Community supply of goods, on the basis of German legislation applicable in 2004, this did not correspond to intra-Community acquisition of goods, but rather to taxable transaction with place of transaction in the territory of Germany.
Differences in the legislation were eliminated in the CR by adoption of Act No. 635/2004 Coll. amending some laws to comply with the administrative fees act effective as from 1 January 2005.
23. A review of selected intra-Community transactions in cooperation with the BRH, showed that a Czech taxpayer declared intra-Community supplies to a German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 240,411,163 (EUR 8,071,823) in his RS for the 1st and 4th quarters of 2005, and that another Czech taxpayer declared, in the RS for the same period, intra-Community supplies to another German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 263,470,776 (EUR 8,846,050).
Information provided to the SAO by the BRH indicated that both cases involved the supply of electrical energy.
Pursuant to statutory text of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective as from 1 January 2005, in the case of supply of electrical energy, the place of transaction is the place where the acquirer has his registered office, the place of business or where he has his commercial premises for which these goods are supplied.
Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have entered the supplies of electrical energy in their RS in 2005.
The fact that both taxpayers declared intra-Community supply of electricity in their RS led to distortion of data in VIES by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917,873).
Conclusion
The cooperation achieved the objectives of BRH and SAO.
Both SAI obtained a deeper knowledge of the systems of administration of VAT in the CR and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences of the two systems and disclosed that the legal provisions governing VAT administration vary.
During the parallel audits, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were detected.
Some of them merit further review.
On the basis of audit findings, both SAI produced recommendations on VAT administration.
To monitor implementation of these recommendations and to review the above mentioned cases a follow-up audit should be conducted..
The new experience and knowledge gained by cooperation of both audit institutions are the basis for successful accomplishment of future audit missions of VAT administration.

Out-of-form Mickelson benched on Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to turn his form around to avoid it being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he so often has been for the United States, the five-times major winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game on the range in the hope of rectifying what ails him.
Never the straightest of drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal fit for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough routinely punishes errant shots.
And if the course on its own is not daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down starting the 12 singles matches, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role that he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't envision him playing two matches.
I envisioned more, but that's the way it worked out and that's the way we thought we had to go.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence brought some intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, likes to poke fun at people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun having a go at him, as well, this week, which was fun to see.
He provides a lot more than just play."

Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizeable lead heading into the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans but only just got over the finishing line with their noses in front by the narrowest of margins, winning 14Â½-13Â½.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only just," said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everybody on that team that this is not over.
You go full bore tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over till you've got the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've said all along, I focus on the 12 players that are in our side, but we are so well aware of what's standing across on the other side - the greatest players in the world."
Delighted how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow's a different beast.
Tomorrow is the individual performances that come forward, and that is a different thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going good, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested to the full of your capacity as a golfer.
That's the message that you need to get across to players, is get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself, as well."
In contrast to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends of those big last-day turnarounds, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up a loser as Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in reply to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallied his players heading into the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get off to that fast start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.
When that momentum gets going one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches.
We set up our line-up accordingly and put the guys out in the fashion that we felt like, you know, we're trying to make some magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been handed the task of trying to lead the fightback and faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," said Bjorn of his singles selections.

Germany's new warship postponed yet again
German Navy's newest frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace ageing Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least the next year due to faulty systems and snowballing cost, local media reported.
Commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels the Navy ordered back in 2007 will come as replacement to the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood they will feature a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - said to allow Germany to project power overseas - will already become outdated by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.
Also, it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Aside from faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also becoming an issue.
It is said to have reached staggering â¬3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from initial â¬2.2 billion.
Problems gripping the newest frigates become especially of importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged the Navy is actually "running out of deployment-capable ships."
The official said the issue has snowballed over time, because old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of the of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.

National Trust eavesdrops on secret life of bats
New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from building and development work that affects roosts and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, roost inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We've got the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within properties as it is possible unwitting destruction of a single maternity roost could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their roosts.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to pitch in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their populations are faring."

Ronaldo dismisses rape claims as lawyers set to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as "fake news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, named as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is alleged to have then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, slammed the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no , no.
What they said today, fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner says into the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it is part of the job.
I am a happy man and all good," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to papers filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" let down by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the pair had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified of retaliation" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to overturn the settlement as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve in a â¬100 million deal.

Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing carmakers
The UK "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience once these jobs go they never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."

Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "pushed back another week" as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby endanger Mueller's independence, has fuelled Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate judiciary committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for that hasn't been set, it could be this week, I could see that pushing back another week given all of the other things that are going on with the supreme court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some reporters would contest that assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of briefings was not due to a distaste for TV reporters "grandstanding," although she said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they grandstand."
She then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any president has prior to him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."
Briefings will still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and that's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly takes questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week the president perhaps demonstrated why, making a freewheeling and at times bizarre appearance before gathered reporters.
The man on the floor had a knife in his back.

Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland over Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to stay on post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal have continued, heading towards expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK Government has also been stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.

Christion Abercrombie Undergoes Emergency Surgery After Suffering Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just kind of collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "no details on type/extent of injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles Saturday before exiting the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.

Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK with the extra cash used to help the homeless under new Tory plans
The move will neutralise the success of Corbyn's drive to attract young voters
The stamp duty rise will be levied on those who are not paying tax in the UK
The Treasury expects it raise up to Â£120 million a year- to help the homeless
Foreign buyers are set to be charged a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in the UK - with the extra cash used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young voters with pledges to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp duty rise will be levied on individuals and firms not paying tax in the UK, with the extra money boosting the Government's drive to combat rough sleeping.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the present stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-lets - could be as much as three per cent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to Â£120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of new-build London properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people own their first home.
He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by snapping up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing disgrace."
Mr Corbyn has announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy homes as hard-working British residents.
For too many people the dream of home ownership has become all too distant, and the indignity of rough sleeping remains all too real."

Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become the Scotland manager at some stage.
The Scot, 42, is relishing the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who currently sit third place in League One, three points off the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it is always something that has drawn me back.
That opportunity would only come, though, if I am successful in club management."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no trepidation in following such established names at such a big club, having previously rejected overtures from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be gauged by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It is not an easy task to get it there, but I would probably only view myself as being successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his management career, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from the brink of relegation to Championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled, of taking charge of Alloa.
"I genuinely did believe management was the right fit for me, more so than playing.
It sounds bizarre because I did okay, made a reasonable living out of it, and enjoyed some reasonable highs.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I still go through that in terms of the stresses and pressure of the job but management just feels right.
I always wanted to manage and now I am doing it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my entire adult life."

Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday, survey finds
The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain's struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent, figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs were up 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July.
Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down.
Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun, although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Across managed pubs and bars drink sales were up 6.6 per cent for the month, with food down three per cent."
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, albeit a sales drop of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we've experienced in August will provide some much-needed respite."
Total sales growth across pub and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow down in brand roll-outs.

One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, survey reveals
Survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed growth in "fake Insta" pages
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty per cent of pupils said they have a "main" account to show parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed a rapid growth in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty per cent of pupils said they operate a sanitised "main" account to show parents, while also having private ones.

HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing so many teenagers are tempted into creating online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."

Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from her wide-ranging experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has massive respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland would benefit hugely by bringing her on to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am keen to act as a voice for athletes and I am hoping I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."

Breast pump advert comparing mothers to cows divides opinion online
A breast pump company has divided opinion online with an advert that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the "world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired advert to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to expressing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn of cows to a track that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see no tail" and "In case you hadn't noticed these are not udders, they're my boobs."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies."
However, the advert, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it makes light of the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision using cows to advertise this product.
Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Such an out of touch advert."
Others defended the advert, with one woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious."
"I think this is a genus idea.
I would've had one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advert is a little mad but I took it for what it was.
This is a genius product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advert aimed at mums who pump (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advert praising or judging the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women reveal they've all been dancing with the discreet pumps tucked in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breast-pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between expressing women and dairy cows we wanted to put breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in an entertaining and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.

Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
"Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens.
So we are continuing to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
Seeking to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported.
The longer that children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked, because of its size.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with.

Syria tells US, French and Turkish 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" of both terror groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-wracked country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were fine for them to return, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to press ahead with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal averted a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem however stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee comprised of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.
Moualem laid out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be restricted "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.

Outside money floods into tightest midterm election House races
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of cash, thanks to a realignment of a congressional districts that landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat.
This recently redrawn suburban Pittsburg district pits Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in Republicans' favor.
The race in the new 17th has touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the major party finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely watched in March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given Democrats a slight edge.

U.S. Weighed Penalizing El Salvador Over Support for China, Then Backed Off
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pushback from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to call back the American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement early this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for narcotics controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to go forward, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now slated to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a signal of the import the administration places on the gathering, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punishments from Washington.

Procurement of public building and corruption prevention
Joint report on parallel audit submitted by the Czech Supreme Audit Ofice (NKÃ) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (BRH)
Introduction and overview
The procurement of goods and services by public-sector contracting agencies is of great importance both for the government and for the business community.
The governmentâs task is to use public resources as efficiently and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), public contract awarding is key to the success of the single economic area.
In order to ensure a largely unrestricted competition in the field of crossborder procurement, awarding authorities also have to meet certain requirements imposed by the EU in awarding contracts where the contract value exceeds certain thresholds.
To this end, the EU Member States have to transpose EU procurement law into their national law and apply it.
This has already happened both in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
For contracts worth less than the EU thresholds, regulating public contract awarding procedures remains a matter for the individual countries.
Moreover, the contract award procedure is, as a rule, vulnerable to corruption.
In view of the generally high damage potential, awarding authorities are obliged to take reasonable action to fight and to rule out corruption and abusive favouritism in their contract award procedures (corruption prevention).
In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI â NKÃ) and the Bundesrechnungshof of Germany (German SAI â BRH) agreed to conduct parallel audits both of the EU-wide awarding of building contracts and of corruption prevention.
The audit focused on the application of EU procurement law as transposed into national law and corruption prevention of contracts for building construction and road construction and/or transport infrastructure.
The audit also covered contract awards below the EU thresholds with a view to corruption prevention.
The two SAIsâ audit findings are summarised in the joint report, which is also to be addressed to international institutions such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Fields of audit and audited bodies
The assessments performed by the German SAI are for the most part based on horizontal audits of the above-mentioned topics, which we carried out at German building authorities responsible for federal road and building construction in the years 2011â2012.
This included e.g. the construction of motorways and large building construction projects.
In addition to that, the German SAI included findings from previous audits in the assessment.
The assessments performed by the Czech SAI were based on audit findings generated in the years 2008â2012. The audits covered the construction of roads, railway lines, hydraulic engineering projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural buildings, universities, etc.), and some other areas in the Czech Republic.
Federal contract award procedures in Germany are largely conducted by the construction administrations of the countries.
In the Czech Republic, the road and estimate construction administrations of the State have central responsibilities for awarding contracts relating to transport infrastructure.
In building construction, responsibility for contract award procedures is decentralised, i.e. the procedures are conducted by the entities which receive state budget funds.
In both countries, the services of self-employed professionals are used in individual stages of contract award procedures.
When comparing the assessments, differences in procurement legislation and structural peculiarities of the construction services and markets of both countries have to be observed.
Structure of procurement law in the two countries
In Germany, the conduct of EU-wide contract award procedures is governed by Acts of Parliament and delegated legislation.
Contract award procedures limited to Germany are governed by budgetary law and administrative regulations based on it .
Many supplementary provisions both for EU-wide and national contract awards are contained in internal administrative rules.
Further details concerning the requirements of EU procurement law and corruption prevention are set forth in the socalled âcontract award manualsâ of the Federal Government, in which the requirements are complemented or formulated in greater detail taking regard to judicial precedent in the field of procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, contract award procedure is governed exclusively by the respective Act on Public Procurement and other legal provisions, which apply to contract values both above and below the EU thresholds.
Procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.
The new provisions strengthened transparency in the management of public funds, opened the way for more competition and limited the opportunities for corruption in the contract award procedures.
Basic features of procurement law in the two countries
In both countries, especially the open procedure, the restricted procedure and the negotiated procedure are to be applied where contracts are to be awarded EU-wide.
In Germany, contracts below the EU threshold are awarded in accordance with the national procedures (public invitation to tender, restricted invitation to tender, negotiated contract), which, however, are aforementioned procedures. largely identical with the EU-wide contract award.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of preference for the open procedure (where tenders have to be invited EU-wide) and for the public invitation to tender (in case of merely national contract awards).
Under the open procedure and the public invitation to tender, every interested enterprise may submit a bid.
Another essential feature of German procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
This is achieved mainly by dividing an overall public works project in trade-specific lots and part lots.
By awarding separate contracts for these lots, as many enterprises as possible, are to be given the chance to compete.
The two aforementioned characteristics of German procurement are time-tested tools for obtaining good value for money.
More than 330,000 construction firms with workforce of 1.9 mil. are registered in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, the EU-wide contract award procedures are also to be applied to public works contracts below the EU threshold.
An exception to this is the simplified procedure below threshold, where the contracting authorities may under certain conditions use considerably less strict procedure.
In agreement with EU law, Czech procurement law includes provisions according to which contracts are to be concluded, if competition is guaranteed and an advantageous price is obtained.
The present Czech legislation enables contracting authorities to choose between open and restricted procedure.
In the Czech Republic, there are about 85,000 registered building companies, out of it 1,900 building contractors with 20 or more workers each.
Aggregate volume of public works contracts awarded by contracting agencies and shares of contract award types in the two countries
In 2011, the total volume of construction works in Germany totalled â¬ 307 billion.
Of these, â¬ 45.5 billion (equivalent to 15 per cent) were accounted for by public contracts which, apart from contracts awarded by the Federal Government, included contracts awarded by the Federal States and municipalities.
The total volume of federal building and road construction projects (without railway construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to â¬ 8.5 billion.
In 2011, the breakdown of federal contracts for building construction and construction of longdistance roads by type of award procedure was as follows:
80.7 % Open procedures and public invitations to tender 12.7 % Restricted procedures and restricted invitations to tender 6.6 % Negotiated procedures and discretionary awarding of contracts 33.2 % of which were EU-wide tenders.
In 2011, the volume of public works in the Czech Republic totalled â¬ 4.7 billion, which accounts for about 25 per cent of the total volume of all building works in the Czech Republic.
In 2009 the volume reached â¬ 7.8 billion e.g. 37% of the total volume of public works.
Structure of types of awards in 2011: 65,1 % open procedure 14,3 % restricted procedure 9,5 % negotiated procedure 8,4 % simplified procedure for awards below the threshold 2.7 % other procedures
The data comprise all public contracts for supplies, services and construction works awarded by public contracting authorities in 2011.
These figures show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on an important part of public contract awarding; corruption prevention, that always has to be observed when awarding contracts, has a significant financial impact and the open procedure and/or open tendering are of key importance when awarding contracts.
Summary of the basic results
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÃ) and the Supreme Audit Institution of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have conducted parallel audits of EU-wide awarding of public works contracts and corruption prevention in their respective countries.
In this context, the working groups of the two SAIs compared the legal frameworks and administrative regulations in the Czech Republic and in Germany and the results of their parallel audits which they conducted specifically in the fields of building construction and road construction.
The key findings were:
The EU Directives on the awarding of public works contracts have been transposed into national law both in the Czech Republic and in Germany (items 1 and 3.1).
Corruption prevention is not only the purpose of the EU Directives but also of the national procurement rules of both countries, which partly differ as to their points of emphasis and degree of detail.
In both countries, an essential requirement to be met by the tender documents is that they have to include all information needed for appropriately drawing up bids.
The specifications must be neutral and not include any requirements that restrict competition.
The tender documents in Germany largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic the problem of determining the subject of the contract largely exists.
In Germany, public works are to be divided into lots whenever possible in order to promote competition.
According to the BRHâs findings, this requirement was largely met in Germany.
The NKÃâs audits showed that awarding large volumes of public road works without division into lots or division in only very large lots may impair competition and result in a restriction to only a few large companies.
These restrictions of market potential may result in major cost increases and bear the risk of undue price negotiations and collusion.
Legal provisions of both countries enable, under certain conditions, the contracting authorities to award contracts of additional or modified construction works if the need for this arises after concluding the contract (item 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of award were largely complied with in both countries.
According to the provisions of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities may freely choose between open and restricted procedures.
In contrast, the relevant German provisions in procurement and budgetary law stipulate the precedence of the open procedure both for EU-wide tenders and for national tenders known as public invitations to tender.
This enables more enterprise to submit bids.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price-fixing by collusion of bidders difficult and produces the best results in terms of value for money.
In the case of major work projects whose estimated total value reached or exceeded a threshold set by the EU, the contracting authorities audited always applied Europe-wide tendering procedures.
When determining the type of award procedure, the correct estimation of the contract value is of essential importance.
In Germany, databases for objective setting estimated public works prices are used, especially in the area of building construction.
The data is based on evaluations of construction projects already completed.
In the Czech Republic, the databases are used only in the area of road construction, but they are not efficient tool as yet (item 4.2).
Where contracts for work projects are to be awarded by EU-wide tendering procedures, prior information and contract notices have to be published. This is to strengthen competition by allowing interested enterprises to prepare at an early stage for submitting bids.
KontrolovanÃ­ zadavatelÃ© zpravidla tento poÅ¾adavek plnili.
V ojedinÄlÃ½ch pÅÃ­padech byly zjiÅ¡tÄny omyly ve zveÅejnÄnÃ½ch informacÃ­ch, nesprÃ¡vnÃ¡ aplikace poÅ¾adavkÅ¯ a nedostatek kontrol, coÅ¾ mohlo konkurenci poÅ¡kodit (bod 4.3).
The selection of bidders for participation in restricted award procedures is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of bidders invited must be sufficiently high to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, non-discriminatory and must be published in advance.
In addition to EU requirements, the contracting authorities in both countries are to alternate as frequently as possible among the enterprises to be invited when selecting participants.
In Germany, there are partly very detailed requirements to counteract the risk of manipulation.
In some cases, the audited bodies did not take regard to the requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the selection decisions made were not always plausible (item 4.4).
In both countries, the contracting authorities have to ensure, during the tender stage, that all enterprises interested in submitting a tender receive identical information.
To avoid collusion that would restrict competition, any contacts among these enterprises and between them and independent professionals that were involved in drawing up the specifications have to be prevented to the greatest extent possible.
The corresponding provisions in Germany are more extensive than those in the Czech Republic.
However, the audited construction administrations in Germany did not comply with requirements in some cases (item 4.5).
In both countries, the opening of the bids must comply with the cross-check and transparency principles.
The requirements for the marking, documentation, preservation and secrecy of the bids are to restrict the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The audits in both countries revealed only few deficiencies (item 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the bids are regulated in both countries by requirements for structural organisation and procedures.
The respective German rules are more comprehensive but were not always, complied with by the audited contracting authorities.
For instance, contracting authorities passed bids on to third parties for examination without first inspecting them and without adequately documenting any conspicuous feature.
The bids were thus inadequately protected against subsequent manipulations (item 4.7).

The documentation of the contract award procedures by the audited construction authorities in the two countries was not always complete or plausible.
In the case of some procedures, the transparency requirement, which applies throughout the EU, had not been adequately observed in the contract award memos.
Moreover, some of the deficiencies found diminished the corruption prevention effect of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting duties (item 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU procurement law and corruption prevention
European procurement law
In order to guarantee free competition and free movement of services and goods within the European Union, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, the Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts (Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of contracts) and the Directive on the coordination of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of review procedures to the award of public supply and public works contracts (Remedies Directive), that were to be transposed into national law.
In particular, the general procurement principles of the European Union include the competition requirement, the equal treatment requirement or prohibition of discrimination and the transparency requirement.
To accomplish these objectives, the Directive on the coordination of EU-wide procedures for the award of contracts includes provisions relative to construction projects the expected order total of which reaches or exceeds â¬ 5 million.
Such provisions impact especially on the contents of tender documents, the applicable type of procedure, the publication of certain information prior to, during and after the contract award procedure, the compliance with the deadlines for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the contract award dokumentaci celÃ©ho zadÃ¡vacÃ­ho ÅÃ­zenÃ­; the qualification requirements that may be imposed on tenderers and the criteria according to which a tender is selected.
The tenderersâ legal protection is governed by the Remedies Directive.
In the case of potential breaches of procurement law, enterprises may have the contracting authorityâs decision reviewed within review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union Directives into national law.
Corruption prevention
Significance of corruption prevention
In neither country is there a legal definition of what constitutes corruption.
In general, corruption is understood to mean the misuse of a position of confidence for private advantage.
As a rule, it is implied that such abuse is incited by those who benefit from it.
Corruption may hamper competition and may cause substantial economic damage.
According to estimates, global costs caused by corruption, amount to 5 % of the global economic output.
For the European Union area, these costs are estimated at an amount equivalent of 1 % of the areaâs economic output.
If the contracting authority is involved, agreements restricting competition or unfair behaviour may undermine confidence in the integrity and the capability of the public administration to function.
Thus, preventing corruption is an essential task for awarding authorities.
Practices and procedures are to be reviewed to adress areas that are especially vulnerable to corruption so that appropriate anticorruption measures can be taken.
Taking preventive measures and carrying out effective controls may substantially reduce vulnerability of decision-making processes to corruption.
As a rule, the awarding of works contracts is considered to be particularly vulnerable to corruption.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption is prosecuted under penal and employment law, this especially applies to active and passive bribery and to the undue acceptance of benefits and undue granting of benefits.
In order to prevent corruption, the German Federal Government issued a guideline together with recommendations on corruption prevention in the federal administration , according to which, in addition to risk analyses, the following principles shall apply to contract award procedures: precedence of open tendering multiple control principle and transparent decision-making separation of planning, awarding of contracts and accounting precise and full documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, further provisions having a preventive effect against corruption have become part of procurement law.
In 2011, the federal department responsible introduced an IT-supported system to monitor the awarding of federal road construction contracts.
By means of this system, procurement data, e.g. estimated costs, order total and private independent professionals involved, can be fully recorded and analysed with a view to finding irregularities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is similiarly prosecuted under penal and employment law.
The legal requirements of transparency, equal treatment of bidders and prohibition of any discrimination are the most important bases of corruption prevention.
Anti-corruption measures in the area of public procurement have been set down by the government in a strategy on fight against corruption for 2011â2012 which was updated for 2013â2014.
Some parts of these measures were already incorporated into public procurement law and respective implementing regulations.
The new legislation essentially contains the following provisions decrease of contracts for small scale obligation of prior contract award announcement by the contracting authority, including the reasons of the contract prohibition of limiting the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and thus impossibility of limiting the number of tenderers based on drawing obligation of publishing the contract awarded, including the supplements obligation of publishing the real price and the list of sub-contractors
Audit results related to the successive phases of the contract award procedure
Tender documents
Tender documents The tender documents must include all information which the bidders need for preparing their tenders in due form.
In particular, the tender documents must permit accurate costing.
To ensure this, bidders must not be burdened with risks they cannot calculate.
The tender documents mainly consist of the specifications. They also include the requirements for proving the biddersâ qualification and the criteria for selecting the most cost-effective bid.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
Requirements provided for by EU law especially focus on technical specifications.
All bidders must have equal access to them and they are to restrict competition as little as possible.
As a matter of principle, specifications have to be product-neutral.
Any details as to specific products or manufacturers as part of the technical specifications are therefore admissible only within narrow limits.
To avoid the inclusion in the tender documents of requirements that restrict competition is an elementary principle of corruption prevention.
Furthermore, it is necessary to avoid ambiguities or inaccurate information when preparing the tender documents, since such deficiencies provide a scope for speculations in connection with the preparation of bids and for manipulations in the evaluation of bids.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions about technical specifications into their national law.
As a matter of principle, specifications have to be product-neutral without requiring any particular brands.
As a matter of principle, the specifications must outline the supplies and services required, detailing the number of units of work or supplies.
In this normal case, prices are to be stipulated by units of work or supplies (e.g. euro/mÂ² or euro/item).
Only in exceptional cases is it admissible to define the work to be done in terms of functional objectives.
As a rule the specifications need to be complete and unambiguous.
They have to include precise quantities and may not comprise work or supplies whose necessity is uncertain.
Remuneration in lump sum form or input of working time should be avoided whenever possible.
These provisions are to preclude speculations and manipulations based on ambiguous specifications in the tender documents.
The specifications must enable each bidder to prepare his bid safely and without extensive preliminary work.
The invitation to tender is to be announced only after completion of the tender documents.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic there is no obligation to invite construction tenderers for lots.
The contracting authority is entitled to subdivide a public contract into several separate lots, if it is admitted by the nature of the subject-matter of such public contract.
In Germany, there is a requirement in principle to divide construction projects into lots, either divided by quantities (partial lots) and/or specialties (specialised lots).
This is to enable small and medium-sized contractors to compete, to increase the number of potential bidders and to make price-fixing more difficult.
This type of award is considered as usually providing best value for money.
In the Czech Republic, all tender documents, both for national and EU-wide awards, must include the evaluation criteria.
This is to inform the bidder completely and exhaustively about the criteria according to which his tender is to be evaluated.
In Germany, the requirement to indicate evaluation criteria in the EU-wide contract notice or, failing that, in the tender documents applies only to EU-wide invitations to tender.
In national contract award procedures, the evaluation criteria need only be included in the contract award memo, which is an internal administrative document.
Where the tender documents are prepared by commissioned independent professionals, the German regulations require any information to be omitted from the tender documents that may help to identify the (firms of) architects or civil engineers involved.
This is to prevent individual contractors from obtaining any additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contacts with these independent professionals without the contracting authority being aware of this.
This is also the reason why independent professionals may neither post tender documents nor make planning documents available for inspection.
The contracting authority is the sole contact of the contractors.
At present, no similar provision is in force in the Czech Republic.
In case of big construction projects, the necessity of extra or modified works almost always occurs after conclusion of the original contract.
Legislation in both countries enables to award the extra works contract up to a certain threshold to the same supplier without having to conduct an award procedure and to publish a contract notice.
The volume of extra works as per both European and German legislation must not exceed 50% of original contract price.
In addition, extra works need to be indispensable and identifiable as extra components to the major contract.
In the Czech Republic, stricter limit of 20% applies to such award procedure without publishing a contract notice.
However, this may bring higher risks of time delays of project realization and eventual involvement of a new constructor in the project just underway.
If the extra works contract is also awarded to the supplier already contracted, German law stipulates the rules not enabling contractors to arbitrarily increase the prices of such modified and/or extra works.
Such calculations must be done with reference to the agreed prices of the original contract.
Apart of extra works, less works in construction may occur.
In Czech republic, less works cannot be mixed with additional extra works.
Basic audit findings
BHR
Technical specifications and productneutral invitation to tender
In individual cases, specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards that had in the meantime been replaced by EU standards.
In some cases, specifications also contained data requiring certain brands for example for graffiti resistance systems, water stops or noise abatement tiles â, although this was not needed.
In some cases specifications were so detailed that only one product could fulfil the requirements.
Bills of quantities subdivided into items
In none of the procedures audited did the German SAI detect any cases of non-compliance with the general requirement to invite tenders for supplies and services according to bills of quantities subdivided into items.
Comprehensiveness of specifications
In most of the cases reviewed, the tender documents had been fully elaborated before the process of soliciting bids was launched.
However in various cases, documents had to be modified during the tendering process to pay due regard to changing items or time schedules.
In isolated cases, tender documents contained work or supplies whose necessity was uncertain.
One tender document on demolition work we looked at consisted almost exclusively of such items.
Lots and criteria according to which the contract is to be awarded
In a large number of cases, the required justification for not subdividing the lots of services into partial lots was not given.
The criteria we studied according to which the contract is to be awarded gave us no reason to point out shortcomings.
Inclusion of names of self-employed professionals
In a number of documents the commissioned independent professionals involved were mentioned.
The names were identified on the cover sheets or on the plans or opinions attached.
In one case, the contracting authority even called upon bidders to contact the architect explicitly mentioned regarding questions on the tender.
In building construction projects such cases were caused in the first place by the self-employed persons commissioned to develop the specification documents.
The building administration services stated that they did not have enough staff to control the tender documents in detail.
NKÃ
Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender
In case of public procurement for 12 apartments building, there was reference to concrete supplier and type of product mentioned in the specification.
Contracting authority did not admit using of other comparable types of products. and did not give reason for insisting on these concrete suppliers and products.
In connections with the constructing of various university facilities, the tender documents specified concrete suppliers and products.
Overall list of specifications with partial specifications
In case of constructions of some industrial zones contracting authority did not clearly specify the volume and type of requested works and supplies in the list of measurement, and as measuring unit he specified for each building only the built up volume in cubic meters.
Comprehensiveness of specifications
During the procurement of public contract for construction of a road circle, the tender documentation for restricted procedure was four times changed in the period of Augustâ September 2009.
The reason was increasing of scope of delivery and changes of technical conditions.
In case of some social buildings construction the tender documentation showed mistakes which resulted in necessity of extra works (precise location missing, technical and constructional research insufficient, drawings missing).
Tender documentation for construction of a big library described the elements of interior only without specifying product quality requirements.
As a result, some sub suppliers provided some very expensive and above standard equipment.
Lots and criteria according to which the contract is to be awarded
In the Czech Republic, no obligation of dividing public works projects into partial lots or awarding partial contracts is in place.
Analysis of three big parts of a road circle construction proved that within their public procurement in parts (individually by selected installations), savings amounting up to 31.6 million EUR could have been achieved, out of total of achieved public contract prices amounting to 620.3 million EUR.
For example, in case of offer price for 6 individual construction objects as 6 separate parts of one public contract, the savings of 2.5 million EUR (i.e. 25%) could have been achieved.
If the construction works of 20 bridges had been awarded as a separate part of one public contract, the savings amounting to 11.5 million EUR (i.e. 25%) could have been achieved.
In case of road constructions, contracting authority imposed very extensive requirements for references as suitability criteria.
In tender documentation of open procedure for one part of a motorway construction, contracting authority requested, among others, such experience of a supplier, proving his realization of at least three road construction projects worth 28 million EUR each, finalized or put into operation within the last 5 years.
In the Czech Republic, there are not more than 9 suppliers complying with the above prerequisite.
Open public procurement for another part of a motorway construction included 6 separate construction works, where the contracting authority demanded minimum yearly construction volume of construction works worth â¬ 480 million within the last 3 years.

In case of together 46 contract award procedures worth â¬ 528 million, there were just two or even one only tenderer.
NKÃ pointed out that restriction of the market potentional may result in major cost increases.
Area of extra works
In case of a road circle construction, contracting authority did not conclude written contract for delivery of extra works (in two cases) and he did not contracted those extra works according to any of procedures prescribed by law.
Value of extra works amounted in the first case up to â¬ 6.7 million without VAT (increase by 21%), in second case up to â¬ 165.4 million without VAT (increase by 91%).
The reason was an unclear determination of quantity a quality features of works.
In case of various University facilities the contracting authority did not comprise some works and deliveries into the tender documentation even if their need and necessity for construction completion and for final inspection were known just when the contract had been awarded. These works and deliveries were done on basis of addendums to the contract between contracting authority and supplier in negotiation procedure without publication.
The volume of extra works overpassed the national limit 20% of the original contract.
In connection with the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award contracts for additional work without invitation to tender.
During construction, the contracting authority increased the contract volume by â¬ 2 million.
The unit prices for the additional work commissioned without competition were considirably higher than comparable work done by the same contractor.
Other findings
Based on selected sample of constructions, NKÃ found out that the average costs of construction of 1 km section of the four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic amounts up to â¬ 14.6 million.
According to the long term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction of Germany, the average costs of 1 km section of the four-lane motorway in Germany amount up to â¬ 10.4 million.
This comparison suggests, that construction of a motorway in the Czech Republic is more costly compared to Germany.
Summarised findings
The basic legal provisions about tender documents are largely identical in both countries and comply with the requirements of EU law.
Their purpose is both to ensure comprehensive and fair competition and to prevent corruption.
The specifications must be sufficiently precise to enable bidders to accurately calculate the costs and prepare their tenders.
Moreover, this requirement is to limit the scope for speculation and the contracting authority is to be protected against the need to make contracts for extra work later.
In Germany, the basic legal provisions about tender documents are supplemented by additional regulations that are to further reduce the possibilities for restricting competition and for effecting manipulations.
While no similarly detailed requirements of this kind exist in the Czech Republic, higher transparency is achieved there by the publication of the evaluation criteria.
The requirements for specifications have largely been complied with in both countries.
In some cases, however, it was necessary to object to deviations that may have resulted in restrictions of competition.
The rule in force in Germany that requires the segmentation of large work projects into lots promotes competition and cost-effective results.
The NKÃ has found that, in the Czech Republic, the award of large works contracts without segmentation into lots or segmentation into very large lots may restrict the circle of bidders to a small number of large enterprises.
As a result of the very extensive requirements for reference imposed in the Czech Republic for selecting bidders for road works, public contracts are awarded to only a small circle of bidders and small and medium-sized enterprises are not given the chance to compete.
A limited number of bidders also increases the risk of price-fixing and other forms of collusion.
Concerning the award of contracts for extra or modified works and the remuneration for such work, the regulatory approaches differ between the two countries.
According to both European and German legislation, extra works not exceeding 50% of the original contract price can be awarded without tendering procedure and contract notice.
In the Czech Republic stricter limit of 20% applies.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often overstepped by contracting authorities.
The reason is an insufficient definition of public works.
If the limit of 20% is exceeded, the extra works must be awarded on the basis of a tendering procedure with contract notice.
By dividing work into lots, restrictions of competition and the resulting detrimental consequences can be avoided.
Determining the type of award and taking regard to the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the contracting authority defines the number of potential contractors participating in the competition.
The contracting authority may leave the number of potential contractors and bidders largely unrestricted or may restrict the number by opting for a restricted procedure.
In the case of work projects whose value reaches or exceeds a threshold set by the EU, EU-wide tendering procedures must be applied.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
When determining the type of award, the contracting authority especially has to comply with the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction work to be performed reaches or exceeds the current EU threshold of â¬5 million, it is always required that the contract be awarded EU-wide by open or restricted procedure.
In exceptional cases, negotiated procedure or competitive dialogue is admissible.
Where construction projects reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a restricted extent from the principle of EU-wide contract awarding and may award contracts by national procedure, if the estimated contract value of the lot concerned is below â¬ 1 million and the total value of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value.
It is not allowed to inappropriately divide a project by its nature single construction project without compelling reasons or deliberately estimate its cost too low in order to avoid the obligation in principle to carry out a EU-wide procedure for awarding the works contract.
Since restrictions of competition substantially increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of major importance for purposes of corruption prevention.
The detailed justification of the choice of type of award and the considerations made about the obligation to apply EU procurement law are important parts of the documentation of the contract-award procedure.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have completely implemented in national law the EU legal requirements for contract award procedures and thresholds.
Differing provisions
The Czech Republic has made arrangements to apply the principle of equal validity of open and restricted procedures laid down in the directive to its national awards of work contracts.
Open and restricted procedures may always be freely chosen without the need to document or justify the decision. Other types of procedure are only permitted where certain legally defined conditions are met.
Differing from that arrangement, the relevant German provisions of budgetary law and of the guidelines for preventing corruption as a rule give preference to open procedure or public invitation to tender.
Other types of procedure â including even restricted procedure or restricted tendering â are permitted only in exceptional cases, which are exhaustively determined by procurement law.
Such an exceptional case must be plausibly justified and documented.
The principle of preference for open procedure or public invitation to tender is to guarantee competition that is as little restricted as possible and to prevent opportunities for manipulation and for price-fixing among bidders by deciding in advance to choose certain tenderers.
In Germany, the principle of public tendering is a central element of corruption prevention.
The correct estimation of expected prices of a public contract is an essential basis for deciding the adequate type of public contract award procedure.
When estimating the costs of public building construction projects, the construction administrations in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations.
These databases have been compiled through analyses of completed construction projects. These databases include, among other information, standard cost figures for types of buildings, building units, building components or individual building work.
Based on such standard cost figures, it is eventually possible to estimate the contract value of a planned project or building work to be commissioned.
Only a few construction administrations in Germany already have similar databases for road construction.
However, it is intended to implement such databases nationwide.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable construction projects for determining the expected costs of a public contract for building constructions.
In most cases, cost determinations are based on estimates of the entity that funds the project or result from the amount of funds made available to the construction administration entity in question.
The measures for standardizing are in initial stage only.
On the basis of the programme of corruption fighting for the period of 2011â2012, the respective ministries work out the data base of customary prices of standardized commodities.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The data base should serve as set of information about construction and assembling works, materials and products, and other data to enable the calculation of necessary costs and determination of unit prices.
Ministry of Transport issued price data base for transport constructions as means of price controlling, which are currently updated.
The database is intended to determine the price in project (investment) plan, and they should play comparative function within further phases of construction preparatory works.
Key audit findings BRH
Choice of tendering procedure
The contracting authorities audited largely invited tenders under open procedure or public invitation to tender, thus complying with the requirements of budgetary and procurement law.
In 2011, 59.5% of the aggregate contract volume of federal construction projects in the field of building construction was accounted for by public tendering.
In road construction, this share was 94.8%.
In some case where non-public tendering was chosen, we found that the reasons for the contracting authoritiesâ infringement of the principle of open procedure or public invitation to tender were not stated in detail.
In the course of a horizontal audit, the BRH found, on the basis of information compiled about more than 16,000 contract award procedures, that the restricted procedures have a clear disadvantage, where competition is concerned, in comparison to public procedures and public invitations to tender and that they also increase the risks of manipulation and corruption.
Public tenders in the field of building construction elicited more than twice as many bids as restricted tenders and nearly three times as many bids as awards under negotiated procedure.
Our study also revealed that the bid prices quoted in restricted procedures and negotiated procedures were 6% and 10% higher respectively than those quoted in public procedures.
Parallel studies of the Federal Building Ministry and of a Land court of audit confirmed the differences in value for money obtained by public and by restricted procedures.
The Federal Building Ministryâs performance study even revealed that the prices quoted in restricted procedures were twice as high as those quoted in public procedures.
Taking regard to the EU threshold
In respect of those work projects whose aggregate contract value was estimated at more than â¬ 5 million, the construction authorities audited usually made contract awarding plans in which they specified which works were to be awarded by EU-wide tender and which by national tender.
According to the contract awarding plans, the share of those works that required Europe-wide tendering always exceeded 80% of the total works.
There was no evidence of circumvention of the requirement to invite tenders Europe-wide by excessively low cost estimates.
However,in some cases, as a result of errors in the calculation of total contract value, the minimum share of EU-wide tendering was undercut.
During the execution of work, some construction authorities illicitly changed the determinations made in the contract awarding plan.
They did not give any reasons for these changes and did not prove that the minimum share of EU-wide tendering continued to be complied with.
The share of EU-wide tendering according to the accounts for the projects was usually lower than laid down in the contract awarding plan.
Where the expected contract values of construction projects exceeded the EU threshold, the construction authorities did not apply EU-wide tendering to all individual lots worth more than â¬1 million.
Instead, they awarded the respective contracts under national procedures without giving sound reasons for the necessity of deviating from the requirement.
NKÃ
Choice of tendering procedure
In the case of several large-scale building projects, e.g. the construction of some motorway sections, of facilities for a big sports event and of housing projects, the contracting authorities split one project into several parts, although these partial contracts were of the same or similar character.
Splitting resulted in decrease of expected value under the fixed limit, and the contracts were thereafter awarded in less strict under limit procedure, or even out of law regime.
Methods for calculating the estimated contract value
Price databases set up for transport infrastructure works did not appear as sufficient tool for estimating contract volumes with some degree of accuracy.
They originated from just realized public procurements, which comprised eventual lacks of economy, construction over-works or excessive profit of suppliers.
The actual prices for three sections of the road circle were about 37% below the determined price from the database.
Ministry of transport updated the databases in a way to reflect not only the bid prices of the past years, but even comparison with comparable markets and index numbers of price progress in the area of construction.
As far as the building construction concerns, the estimative price was based on budget of project architects or estimation of investors.
The true price than varies considerably.
Assumed price of a big library reconstruction was doubled compared to the contract price, however, based on eight addendums, in process of realization the final price increased by â¬ 2.1 million, i.e. by 27%.
Similarly, when constructing a library despository, the true price was by 33% lower compared to assumed price and prices increased during realization.
In other cases, the price of successful bidder is higher compared to assumed price and moreover, during realization it still increases.
In case of a big library construction the assumed price increased by â¬ 16 million, i.e. by 22%, and in case of construction of a justice palace, the volume of financial needs increased during the works disproportionately (by 139%) compared to increase of function surfaces (12%).
Summarised findings
Since both countries have implemented in national law the EU provisions about the choice of type of awarding procedure and about taking regard to the EU threshold, the respective national provisions are largely identical.
However, the principle of public procedure or public tendering applicable in Germany is stricter than the EU provisions and the national provisions in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to the restricted contract-award procedures, public procedure or public tendering gives more businesses the opportunity to participate in competition.
These types of contract award procedure generate a large number of bids and the best results in terms of value of money.
Corruption prevention is enhanced considerably, since the circle of candidates is not restricted by decisions taken beforehand by the contracting authority which leave room for manipulation and for price fixing among bidders.
The studies have confirmed the advantage obtained through the German rule that preference must be given to public procedure or public invitation to tender.
Czech legal rules enable the contracting authorities to award a contract in open or restricted procedure.
However, the latest amendment of procurement law has introduced a general prohibition to limit the number of bidders in procedures that involve a prior competition for participation.
The restricted procedure has now become very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirement to give preference to open procedure or public invitation to tender, whereas in the Czech Republic some projects have been divided, which is not allowed, in order to circumvent the requirements governing the choice of the type of awarding procedure.
However, in Germany in some cases the EU threshold has not been taken regard to, ensuing that the minimum share of EU-wide tendering was undercut.
In the Czech Republic, no satisfactory solution facilitating the correct calculation of expected costs of construction works and construction projects does yet exist.
The construction authorities should ensure, if applicable, by means of more extensive controls that the requirements governing the choice of type of awarding procedure and the volume of contracts to be awarded EU-wide are complied with or should create the conditions necessary to be able to calculate costs accurately.
Prior information and contract notice
Where contracts for work projects are to be awarded by EU-wide tendering procedures, the contracting authority is to publish a contract notice for interested businesses outlining the contracts to be awarded.
Prior information and contract notices are an important basis for EUwide
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
The prior information notice has to include the essential specifications of the intended work project.
These notices are required in the case of work projects whose estimated total contract value is equal to or higher than the EU threshold and where the contracting authority wishes to shorten the deadlines for submitting tenders in open or restricted procedures.
The contracting authority has to publish a contract notice with detailed information on any public works contract that requires EU-wide tendering.
Once published, this information is binding on the contracting authority.
Among other information, the contract notice has to include the specifications, the deadlines for the procedure and the performance of the contract, the special requirements, the award criteria and their weighting.
The EU-wide common procurement vocabulary (CPV) must be used to describe the subject of the contract.
The prior information and contract notices are published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the buyer profile of the contracting authority.
To prevent any discrimination of foreign interested parties, notices published at national level may not contain any additional information and may not be published before the text of the notice has been posted to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in the contract notice may impair competition and perhaps even facilitate manipulation.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have fully implemented the EU provisions on prior information and contract notices in national law.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, prior information and notices must also be published for the works contracts for which EU-wide tendering is not required.
Contract award procedures may not start earlier than one month after the publication of prior information in the EUâs Official Journal (in case of EU-wide award procedures) and in the national official gazette (in case of all award procedure).
The publication of prior information can only be omitted in exceptional cases.
In Germany, the publication of prior information is not needed in cases where no EU-wide tendering is required.
In case of national tendering procedures public invitations to tender and competitions for participation preliminary to restricted invitations to tender must be publicly announced on the Federal Governmentâs website and, where appropriate, in newspapers orjournals.
In case of restricted invitations to tender without competition for participation, notices have to be published where the estimated contract value amounts to or exceeds â¬ 25,000 (ex ante transparency).
Preliminary information notices must set forth all planned lots of the work projects.
Given the small volumes of works contracts awarded in Germany, this is an important requirement.
As the number of work projects divided into lots for purposes of tendering is much smaller in the Czech Republic, this provision is much less important there.
Key audit findings
BRH
Preliminary information
The contracting authorities audited published prior information for all public works projects that involved work to be contracted out by EU-wide tender.
However, in the case of some open procedures, they shortened the deadlines for tendering at a time when the required minimum period of 52 days between sending preliminary information and sending the publications had not yet expired.
In the case of other shortened procedures, tenders were invited only when the twelve-month validity period of the preliminary information had already expired and had not yet been extended.
Many publications of preliminary information did not include advice to the effect that the total volume of work would be divided into lots.
Contract notice
Some of the contract notices issued by the audited bodies included CPV codes which deviated from the contents of preliminary information notices or did not accurately specify the work to be done.
In isolated cases, the contract notices published at national level included more information â e.g. concerning performance deadlines â or were published earlier than the notices published in the European Unionâs Official Journal.
Ex-ante transparency
The units of one construction administration had commissioned a service company with publishing the national notices.
The latter published the notices on its own procurement platform for the use of which fees are charged.
The construction authorities had however not checked whether this company had complied with the requirement to pass on the notices to the Federal Governmentâs free internet portal.
Sample audits showed that only one third of the notices had been published on the latter portal.
NKÃ
Contract notice
In case of the construction of a water treatment plant, the contracting authority in its publication of award procedure to suppliers did not indicate the criteria it intended to apply in selecting tenderers.
The contracting authority was not able to prove the way of bid selection.
Reduction of number of bidders was, according to previous legislation, duly in place.
In case of a road circle construction the contracting authority did not specify the figures for evaluation of compliance with qualification criteria and did not indicate the number of bidders to be invited nor in publication of restricted procedure opening neither in the contract award documentation.
The contracting authority evaluated the qualification requirements of all 6 bidders in the restricted procedure as being complied with, but one bidder was excluded because he met the qualification requirements on the last sixth position.
These steps of contracting authority were not transparent, because no information concerning the qualification particulars evaluation and the method of evaluation had ever been published.
Publication of notices
In case of ex-military areas reconstructions, the contracting authority did not publish the written invitation to tender.
Conclusions and recommendations / summarised findings
The two-stage information procedure with prior information and contract notice is an important instrument for implementing the transparency requirement that applies to EU-wide tendering procedures and thus for enhancing competition and preventing corruption.
By extending the obligation to publish prior information to national tendering procedures in the Czech Republic and by applying this obligation in Germany in cases of open and restricted tendering, both countries have implemented EU requirements and thus increased the transparency of national tendering procedures.
Selection of candidates in case of restricted tendering procedures
In contrast to public tendering procedures, restricted tendering procedures do not permit all potential contractors who are interested in winning the contract to participate in the competition.
Under restricted procedures, the contracting authority must previously select potential contractors that will be asked to submit a tender.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
The EU provisions permit a limitation of the number of candidates in EU-wide restricted tendering procedures.
However, restricted procedure requires at least five candidates to be asked to submit tenders and in the case of negotiated procedures with previous publication of a contract notice at least three potential contractors must be invited.
In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently large to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective and nondiscriminatory and must be published in advance.
The selection of potential contractors to be invited is a stage within the tendering procedure which is highly vulnerable to manipulation, e.g. undue preference being given to certain contractors.
Moreover, the restriction of competition to few contractors may facilitate collusive tendering.
In both case, such practices may considerably deteriorate the result of thetendering procedure to the disadvantage of the contracting authority.
Therefore, the latter, must make special arrangements to prevent manipulations, to ensure that adequate controls are in place and that this stage in the procedure is transparent and plausible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
The provisions on the selection of candidates are similar in the two countries.
In addition to EU requirements, the contracting authorities are to alternate among the contractors to be invited.
It is also not permitted to restrict competition to contractors domiciled in particular regions.
The contracting authorities have to document and justify the selection of bidders and the course of the selection procedure in the contract award memos.
Differing provisions
In Germany, it is required to invite at least three candidates in the case of restricted tendering and several suitable candidates in the case of awards by negotiated contract.
Except in two specific cases, the new Czech regulations do not allow limiting the number of invited tenderers in case of restricted and negotiated procedure.
In Germany, it is required to observe the crosscheck principle when selecting the candidates.
If, e.g. one staff member has proposed a list of candidates, a senior manager of the construction administration or a commissioned staff member of the contracting authority must as a rule modify this proposal e.g. by deleting one of the candidates from the list and/or by adding a new candidate.
This is to prevent that a single individual can finally determine the circle of candidates participating in the competition.
In the absence of such a requirement, far-reaching collusion among the participants would be possible.
The list of candidates to be invited must be treated confidentially and not generally divulged.
This also applies to self-employed professionals.
In the Czech Republic, no similar provisions on the drawing up and confidential treatment of lists of candidates are in place.
Under the German provisions, self-employed professionals may not determine the candidates to be invited but may make proposals to the contracting authority.
Czech rules do not deal with this issue
Key audit results
BRH
Number of bidders
With few exceptions, the requirement for a minimum number of potential contractors to be asked to submit tenders in case of restricted procedures was complied with.
An analysis of nearly 7,000 tendering procedures for building construction limited to the national level showed that, in the case of Federal Government restricted procedures, the contracting authorities invited on average 6.6 potential contractors and, in the case of negotiated contracts, on average 4.4 potential contractors.
Change of contractors and regional restrictions
Especially where building trades with few contractors were involved, the contracting authorities did not make any changes in the circle of selected contractors.
Above all, contractors already known for their good performance were considered more frequently.
The contracting authorities argued that, in the case of non-public procedures, they were bound to ensure the suitability of the contractors to be asked to submit tenders even before actually asking them.
While there was no evidence for illicit restrictions to bidders located in the region, the circle of bidders in the restricted tendering procedures included a larger portion of regional bidders than was the case in public tendering procedures.
The contracting construction authorities attributed this mainly to the smaller contract volumes in comparison to those of public tenders which made long ways to the site a more significant cost item.
Cross-checking principles, proposals of self-employed professionals
The contract-awarding authorities largely disregarded the provisions on the fundamental change of the list of proposed contractors by an independent person.
They especially argued the shortage of staff resources for processing, time pressure or inadequate knowledge about alternative suitable contractors.
In many cases, the records did not indicate who had proposed the contractors to be asked to submit tenders.
The audit of some samples revealed that the lists of potential bidders had been made by self- employed professionals and had been adopted by the contracting authorities without any changes.
Thus, the contracting authorities did not adequately protect themselves against potential manipulations.
Confidential treatment of lists of potential contractors
In one contracting authority, the lists of the contractors to be asked for tenders were held on a data-processing system to which all staff of that authority had read access.
If there had been any intent to manipulate, the unauthorised divulgation of the names of the envisaged or admitted bidders would have been possible which might have enabled contractors to commit price-fixing.
Documentation
Only in few cases did the documentation of contract award procedures show reasons for the selection of bidders.
NKÃ
Selection of bidders
In case of a road circle the bidders had no information about the items of the qualification to be assesed and in which way.
In case of development and modernization of water ways and ports, notices of tender in restricted procedure did not indicate criteria of reduction of the bidders.
All eight participating bidders complied with the qualification requirements, but the limited number of bidders was thus exceeded.
Thereafter, the committee proceeded on the basis of accidental selection â by drawing, which, at that time, was a legal step.
This way of selection, however, should have been mentioned as one of criteria just in the tender notice.
Summarised findings
Given the high risk of manipulation in the selection of bidders in restricted contract award procedures, both countries have introduced special arrangements to prevent illicit restrictions of competition.
The German rules restrict such opportunities for manipulation by means of the cross-check principle, by keeping lists of bidders confidential and by restricting the authority to make proposals for the selection of bidders to the contracting authorities.
Under the new Czech rules potential manipulative restrictions tend to be prevented mainly by the requirement that the number of bidders in restricted procedures must be unlimited.
However, the audit evidence generated revealed that part of these rules was poorly implemented and that the potential for an abusive restriction of the circle of bidders was not adequately reduced in these cases.
The contract-awarding authorities should completely eliminate the deficiencies pointed out.
Tendering phase
The tendering phase, in which potential contractors may draw up tenders on the basis of the tender documents which they have received, begins with the publication of the contract notice and/or with the invitation of tenders.
Potential tenderers may submit tenders until expiry of the deadline for submission, prescribed by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
EU law does not impose special requirements for this phase of the tendering procedure.
The contracting authorities have to comply with the national provisions designed to counteract the potential for manipulation that exists during the bidding phase.
Such compliance especially relates to organiational arrangements and controls.
Provision of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
As a matter of principle, the tender documents on the basis of which the potential contractors are to work out their bids must always be sent out by the contracting authority.
Private independent professionals involved in the tendering procedure may not perform this task.
The contracting authority has to make sure, that all candidates receive the same information during the tendering phase.
In case of ambiguities in the tender documents or where other questions arise, only the contracting authority may furnish information to the candidates.
The independent professionals commissioned to draw up the tender documents may not provide any information.
During the entire tendering phase, any direct contact between the commissioned independent professionals and the candidates must be prevented.
The firms are not to become a turntable of the contract awarding procedure which enables contacts to be made that adversely affect competition.
Tenders forwarded by post or directly have to be submitted in a closed envelope.
Tenders communicated electronically must be technically encoded.
Differing provisions
In Germany, the contracting authority may commission external service providers to print and send out the tender documents, whose staff must be made to pledge to keep the bids secret and to perform contractual obligations with due care.
In Germany, the tenders received must be marked with a date of receipt stamp and directly and immediately forwarded unopened to a public servant who is responsible for keeping them in custody.
This public servant must not be involved in the tendering procedure.
The tenders received must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the tenders received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority draws up a memo with the tender data including contract numbers and information about the drawing up and receipt.
There are no detailed provisions about the custody of the tenders.
Key audit findings
BRH
BRH audits of the tendering phase focused on the contract award procedures of one building construction administration.
Posting of contract documents
The contract awarding authorities of the building construction administration audited either posted the tender documents themselves or had them printed and posted by an external service company.
Self-employed professionals did not post any tender documents.
Information furnished to bidders
In its designation of the contacts for making queries and obtaining information, the audited building construction administration largely did not comply with the rules for separating planning from the contract award procedure.
Contrary to applicable provisions, it often did not name staff of the contract awarding authority as contact in the specifications but rather staff from the project management units.
Some contract award notifications even included the names of the firms of self-employed professionals who had drawn up the tender documents.
There were isolated cases in which bidders who made inquiries during the bidding stage did not receive identical information.
Marking of tenders
In the construction administration audited, all tenders received were marked with a received stamp and a receipt note.
In the case of some negotiated procedures, however, the tenders were received by self-employed professionals, a practice which prevention rules. infringed the corruption

In one construction authority, the tenders were temporarily placed in an open pigeonhole of the post room to which each staff member had access.
Another authority had placed a letter-box in a corridor not under constant surveillance and the tenders thrown into this box partly remained there over night.
Since the slot of that letter-box was large and unsecured, not only staff of the authority would have been able to retrieve and manipulate tenders received.
NKÃ
No shortcomings found out in the Czech Republic.
Summarised findings
Provisions are in place in both countries which are to prevent contacts especially between interested enterprises and independent professionals involved in the contract award procedure during the tendering stage.
Equal treatment is to be ensured by furnishing the same information to all bidders.
The rules for the reception, custody and secrecy of the tenders appear suitable for counteracting manipulation and corruption.
In Germany, the relevant requirements are somewhat more comprehensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audit evidence generated in Germany has highlighted infringements of the rules in some areas.
These deficiencies could be remedied with a small input of resources.
Opening of the envelopes
Opening of envelopes
During the bid-opening session, the bids that so far have remained closed will be opened and their contents will be read out and published.
The period during which the bidder is bound by his tender begins at a moment of biddersÂ´ submission date expiry, eventually at the moment of envelopes opening, and ends by deadline set by contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
EU law does not include any specific provisions about the opening of envelopes.
However, national laws and regulations comprise extensive requirements for the protection of the bids and of the competition during this highly sensitive phase of the contract award procedure.
The crosscheck principle and the transparency and traceability of the opening of envelopes are to prevent manipulations and modifications of the tenders submitted.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
The bid-opening session must be conducted by several persons to be designated by the contracting authority.
Compliance with the crosscheck principle is to prevent that individuals can manipulate bids without this being noticed.
In both countries, the bidders may in majority of cases attend opening session.
The envelopes when being opened, must have been lain in front of the leader of the proceedings when the first bid was opened.
Bids that have been received late may never be considered.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening session, the actions taken and the results of bid-opening are to be recorded and the record, among other information, must contain the names of the bidders and the prices quoted.
The minutes must be read out and must be signed by the leader of the proceedings.
The bidders present may also sign the minutes.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, a committee is in charge of the opening of bids.
The participation of independent professionals is permitted.
The Committee may be tasked with conducting subsequent phases of the contract award procedure, e.g. the evaluation of bids.
In Germany, the opening of bids is conducted by a leader of proceedings and a keeper of the minutes.
The leader of proceedings must be a staff member of a contracting authority.
The leader of proceedings and â in the case of building construction â the keeper of the minutes are not to be involved in drawing up the tender documents, in awarding the contract and in contract management.
The German provisions demand that the minutes of the opening session include not only the prices quoted by bidders but also any information about discounts and rebates and extraordinary features e.g. bids received that were damaged or arrived late.
In the Czech Republic, the minutes of the opening session put on record â apart from the prices quoted by bidders â the language of the bid and the applicantâs authority to sign it.
The German provisions require that all parts of the opened bids must be marked so as to prevent any subsequent modifications and amendments.
The bids, which are usually marked by perforation with the date of the opening session, must be kept secret after the opening session and may be made accessible only to the persons commissioned with processing them.
There are no similar Czech provisions.
If only one bid is received in any contract award procedure in the Czech Republic, the bid may not be opened and is to be returned without any evaluation.
In Germany, no similar provision exists. If only one bid is received, it has to be opened and subsequently evaluated.
Basic audit findings
BRH
Cross-checking principle
During the bid-opening sessions, the contracting authorities audited complied with the crosschecking requirement.
They conducted the bidopening sessions always with a session leader and a minute writer to whom no other tenderrelated tasks had been assigned.
In isolated cases of smaller negotiated contracts, however, self-employed professionals opened tenders sent to them, without involvement of the contracting authority.
Minutes
The minutes of the bid-opening sessions did not always completely document the opening of bids.
In some cases, the bids that had been submitted late were not included and in some cases, even signatures were missing.
Marking of bids
The contracting authorities examined in the course of the horizontal audit marked the bids by perforation with the date of the bid-opening session, thereby complying with the requirements.
Audits of grant recipients conducted in the past, had revealed inadequate marking.
These contracting authorities changed their marking practice in response to the BRHâs objection.
NKÃ
Time limit for the receipt of tenders
In case of contracts awarded for road repairs, one bid was received by the contracting authority only one month after expiry of the time limit for the submission of tenders. The contracting authority nevertheless admitted this bid.
Summarised findings
The rules in place in the two countries for opening the envelopes are largely identical. They take into account both the cross-check principle and the principle of transparency which permits a significant restriction of the risks of corruption and manipulation.
The German rules are more comprehensive than those of the Czech Republic.
Especially the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure, on the marking, safe custody and secrecy of the tenders substantially restrict subsequent changes of the tenders.
Moreover, the officials responsible for opening the envelopes may not perform any other functions in connection with the contracts to be awarded.
The fact that the audits revealed few contraventions proves that the rules for the opening of envelopes are largely accepted.
Examination and evaluation of tenders
The contracting authority has to examine and evaluate the tenders that have been received by the envelope-opening day.
It has to award the contract to the tender which best meets the award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
EU law provides for a procedure in several stages:
The first step is to determine the suitability of the tenderers.
These must have a good economic and financial standing and the required professional and technical knowledge or ability.
Economic operators that have been convicted by final sentence for bribery or fraud must always be excluded from the tendering procedure.
The tenders of the tenderers not excluded must be evaluated in terms of arithmetical accuracy, technical feasibility and value for money and on the basis of the previously published contract award criteria.
The contracting authority has to determine the economically most favourable tender. The contracting authority has to examine especially any abnormally low prices offered.
The examination and evaluation stage of the tendering procedure is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.
For instance, tenderers may be excluded without due cause or tenders that not meet the requirements may be kept in the competition.
The result of the evaluation may unduly be influenced by giving preference to a tenderer or putting him at a disadvantage, thereby preventing the determination of the economically most favourable tender.
The contracting authority therefore has to make special arrangements particularly to ensure that the persons commissioned with the examination and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and technical expertise.
It also has to make sure that the tendering procedure and the decisions taken are transparent and plausible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
In line with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries call for the examination and evaluation of tenders by successive stages.
The requirements for the proofs of suitability to be submitted by the enterprises, the evaluation criteria for deciding about the award and the weighting of these criteria have been laid down in the contract notices or the tender documents and may not be changed during the tendering procedure.
After checking the suitability of tenderers, the suitability criteria may no longer be applied in the evaluation of the tenders.
Such evaluation has to be made only on the basis of the contract award criteria.
The tenders submitted must first be examined under formal criteria as to whether they are complete and whether they include conspicuous features that suggest an intention to manipulate.
Where tenderers are excluded from the further examination and evaluation of their tenders, they have to be notified of this without delay.
If the evaluation of tenders results in a price that appears inappropriately low, the tenderer must be given the opportunity to comment on this prior to the potential exclusion of his tender.
The reasons for the decisions taken in the process must be documented transparently.
Differing provisions
In Germany, the tenders must be kept secret and only the persons commissioned to process them may have the right of access.
Only the contracting authority may review the tenders and verify their arithmetical accuracy.
This work may be assigned only to staff not involved in the contract award decision or the implementation of the project.
There are no precise regulations as to who may perform the further examination and evaluation tasks.
Where self-employed persons are commissioned to examine and evaluate the tenders, they have to honour the confidentiality of these tenders.
They only may make decision proposals to the contracting authority.
In the Czech Republic awarding committees are set up for checking and evaluating the tenders.
The committees produce an evaluation report with proposals for the contract award.
However, in both countries the ultimate decisions about contract awards are made only by the contracting authorities.
If, in Germany, proofs or declarations required to be presented in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the contracting authority must give bidders the chance to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents have not yet been received after expiry of this deadline, the bid must be excluded.
In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may at its own discretion decide whether or not to give bidders the opportunity to supplement missing proofs or declarations.
Unless the bidder presents them he must be excluded.
In Germany, not only the total price of tenders has to be examined but also the unit prices (prices of work segments).
If the price structure of the tender suggests that prices for parts of the work to be done have been estimated excessively low or high, the tenderer must be asked to clarify these issues.
If he does not succeed in doing so and if the contracting authority can prove compensatory pricing, the tender in question must be excluded.
This is to prevent that tenderers calculate their tenders on the basis of the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made for certain parts of the work performed, which may lead to significant increases in the cost of work projects.
In the Czech Republic, the overall price is evaluated but not the appropriateness of prices for parts of the work.
Compensatory pricing is no justification for the exclusion of a tender.
In Germany, no contract may be awarded to tenders whose price is inappropriately high or low.
Where one or few tenders differ by 10% or more from the price estimated by the contracting authority or from the other tenders, the tenderers must prove that their tenders have been soundly calculated.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority may exclude these tenders.
Once value for money has been examined, tenders in the Czech Republic may be cancelled if only tenders with an excessively low price that cannot be justified have been received.
Where prices of tenders are substantially higher than the one estimated by the contracting authority, this is not a valid reason for refusing to award the contract to that tender (contrary to German procurement law).
If, in Germany, there is a suspicion of behaviour restricting competition, the contracting authority must immediately report to the authority in charge of its technical oversight.
The latter has to decide about the action to be taken and whether it is appropriate to inform the cartel authority (antitrust authority) or the public prosecution service.
The oversight authority has to approve e.g. also where the works contract is worth more than â¬ 50.000 and the contract has not been awarded to the lowest-priced tender, where the award is to be made by negotiated contract or where the tendering procedure is to be cancelled.
Czech rules do not deal with this issue.
Key audit findings
BRH
Examination of suitability and award criteria
Most contract award procedures examined complied with the requirements set.
In the case of some potential contractors recommended by self-employed professionals, the contract awarding authorities did not check the suitability of these companies themselves.
One grant recipient commissioned contractors although the required proofs of suitability were not completely at hand.
In the case of some tendering procedures, there was no sound evidence as to whether the contract awarding authorityâs choice had taken into account all published award criteria or whether its contract award decision had been based only on the criterion of price.
Selection of persons involved and secrecy of the tenders
Some of the contracting authorities used the services of unauthorised persons.
For instance, self-employed professionals or staff of the construction offices that were involved in the planning or implementation of a work project performed functions whose discharge was incumbent exclusively on the contract awarding authority.
The construction authorities sought to justify this by inadequate staff resources in the sectors concerned.
In some cases, the self-employed professionals commissioned to examine the tenders used staff that had not been formally obliged to keep the tenders secret and to exercise due care in the fulfilment of their contractual commitments.
Concerning the construction authorities, there usually was no conclusive evidence as to whether the tenders, when in the custody of the self-employed professionals, were accessible only for the persons to which their processing was directly assigned.
Review and arithmetical check of the tenders
Some contracting authorities handed over the opened tenders to self-employed professionals for further examination without having first performed the prescribed review of tenders and arithmetical check and documented the results of these examinations.
In case of any intention to manipulate, third parties could have made changes in the tenders which the contracting authorities would not have been able to identify.
The documents examined revealed a number of cases in which unusual features were not adequately marked or where information about prices and products was missing.
Performance audits
A sample audit in a construction authority revealed that, in 75% of all contract award procedures, the most favourable tenders deviated by more than 10% from the estimates made beforehand.
One in twenty contract award procedures was cancelled owing to inappropriate tender prices.
In a number of cases, there was a lack of evidence or sufficient documentation about examinations of tenders or discussions with tenderers held to clarify questions.
In many cases, detailed information was missing, e.g. concerning unit prices of the most important items in the invoices.
Factors such as changed market prices or increases of material costs were frequently given as reasons for the deviations.
The construction authorities stated that identifying and proving compensatory pricing was difficult.
In the case of one invitation to tender issued by a non-departmental body, the lowest price quoted in a tender was 66% lower than the previous estimate of the contract value.
Closer examinations of costing or investigations to identify the causes of this deviation were not on record.
In a discussion to clarify the question, the contract awarding authority did not find any evidence as to price dumping by the tenderer to whom the contract was eventually awarded.
Thus, it remained unclear whether the previous estimate was excessive or the tender price was too low.
Later, the contract awarding authority classified the contractor as âlow-cost companyâ which was neither able to meet the quality requirements nor the deadlines.
In another tendering procedure, the construction authority adjudicated the contract to a tender whose price was 35% higher than the original cost estimate.
It did not cancel the tendering procedure, adducing the unfounded argument that the company in question could be expected not to base its pricing on unreasonably high costs.
Suspicion of irregularities
Two cases of irregularities were found in one audited construction authority and reported to the authority responsible for technical supervision.
In one tendering procedure, two bidders submitted identical cost calculations which prompted the construction authority to exclude both tenders.
The audits did not reveal any significant deficiencies in the application of the other provisions.
NKÃ
Verification of the suitability
In many of the construction projects audited such as university buildings, road and railway construction, and others, the contracting authorities did not exclude the bidders from participation in the procedure, even if they did not comply with the requirements of tender documentation or they did not prove their qualification in the extent prescribed. On the other hand, one contracting authority could neither prove nor explain the reason of excluding a bidder who complied with the requirements.
Evaluation
When awarding a contract for the construction of a water treatment plant the contracting authority did not base its examination and evaluation on the defined evaluation criteria.
In case of rail road construction, the contracting authority determined the weight of evaluation criteria as late as in the beginning of evaluation.
In case of road repairs, the defined criterion of âconstruction period shorteningâ was evaluated inappropriately.
As a result, the shortening offered by the bidders that were second and third in the competition was not adequately taken into account.
Documentation of the reasons why a bidder was selected
In three contract award procedures for the support of housing, the contracting authority did not document what criteria were used in the course of evaluation and what was the way of selection of successful bidder.
When awarding small scale contracts worth up to â¬20 000 in connection with a motorway construction, the contracting authority selected the bidders only on the basis of telephone consultations concerning the prices and terms of deliveries.
It was impossible to audit these selections, because these consultations were not documented.
Summarised findings
In both countries, the rules for examining and evaluating the tenders comply with EU requirements.
However, they differ with respect to detailed steps of the procedure and the selection of the individuals involved.
In Germany, the steps of the procedure are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially concerning the implementation of the cross-check principle and the protection of bids than in the Czech Republic.
The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices quoted.
In both countries it was found that in some of the cases audited essential steps of the procedure for examining and evaluating the tenders were not documented at all or, if they were, only incompletely.
However, the lack of an audit trail and of transparency in respect of the decisions taken during examination and evaluation facilitates manipulations.
A particularly grave deficiency was the handing over of tenders to third parties without prior appropriate examination and documentation of the tenders by the contract-awarding authority which would have prevented any manipulations.
Where contract-awarding authorities commission third parties to perform functions in connection with the examination and evaluation of tenders, appropriate arrangements and enhanced control are necessary to counteract the increased risk of manipulation.
When auditing the appropriateness of prices, the audited administrative entities in Germany did not always make use of the complete range of tools available and thus inadequately explored the price structure.
In the Czech Republic, the audit revealed irregularities especially in connection with the examination of suitability and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Completion of the tendering procedure
Once the tenders have been examined and evaluated, the tendering procedure is completed by awarding the contract or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In case of EU-wide tendering procedures, all tenderers must be notified in advance of the contract award decision taken.
The contractors have the opportunity to examine the intended decision within a period of 10 or 15 days and to seek a review where appropriate.
No contract may be concluded before expiry of this period.
If forwarded electronically or per fax, the limitation period is 10 days. If other means of communication are used, it is 15 days.
If a bidder applies for review within the notification period, a contract may be concluded only after the final decision taken in the review procedure.
Moreover, the enterprises may refer the award decision made under this procedure to an independent court of law for further review.
The review is to ensure both legal protection given to the contractors and compliance with procurement law by the contracting authority.
The contracting authority must adequately document the tendering procedure.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have implemented the EU provisions about the information and review procedure.
In both countries, the decision about awarding the contract lies with the contracting authority.
The latter may however not arbitrarily deviate from the result of a duly conducted examination and evaluation.
The contracting authority is to award the contract within the announced examination period.
The reason is the fact that the bidders are no longer bound by their tenders once this period has expired.
In open and restricted procedures and public or restricted invitations to tender, the contracting authority may not stipulate a content of the contract which deviates from that of the tender.
The unsuccessful bidders are to be notified on a timely basis of the award decision made and the reasons why their respective bids have not been accepted.
The cancellation of tendering procedures is admissible only if certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices quoted in the tenders are excessivesind or the tenders do not conform to the specifications.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, the 10 or 15 days obligatory information and waiting period before awarding the contract also applies to work contracts that do not require Europe-wide tendering.
In Germany, the equivalent provision only applies to EU-wide tendering procedures.
In all other tendering procedures in Germany, the tenderers my not be informed about the contract award until the award decision has been taken.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure must be cancelled, if only one tender has been received or only one tender met the requirements for being considered and evaluated.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded, if only one single tender has been received, provided that this tender meets the conditions set forth in the tender documents and is cost-effective.
Key audit findings
BRH
Only few deficiencies in the completion of the tendering procedures audited were found.
In some cases of EU-wide tendering, companies received commissioning letters before expiry of the notification period, which may render the contract void.
Also, in some cases of open procedures, commissioning letters included modifications incompatible with the contents of the tender, e.g. new deadlines.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not comply with the deadlines for awarding the contracts.
In case of an open procedure, the contracting authority commissioned the second most favourable bidder, because a bidder whose tender price was more than 50 % lower was no longer willing to perform the contract at the price originally quoted.
NKÃ
In case of a construction project in the field of higher education, the contracting authority did not conclude the contract with the bidder in correspondence to the contract proposal indicated in the bid of selected supplier.
In some contract award cases, such as repair and maintenance of the roads, construction of a motorway and of road circle, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts later than prescribed by law.
In case of contracts awarded in the context of exmilitary areas reconstructions, contracting authority dispatched the information of selected bid to all bidders only after expiration of legal deadline.
Summarised findings
Both countries have implemented the EU provisions about the completion of tendering procedures.
The legal protection of unsuccessful bidders contributes to reducing corruption.
Within Czech procurement law, the purview of legal protection also encompasses awards falling below EU thresholds.
In both countries, it was found that the limitation period for awarding contracts had been exceeded.
This may result in adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.
In future, the construction authorities should eliminate such shortcomings in completing tender procedures.
Documentation, notification and reporting duties
During the successive steps of the contractaward procedures, relevant findings and decisions and their underlying reasons must be documented in a transparent way.
In case of EUwide procedure, contract awards are to be publicly announced.
The data on the contract awards are also included in EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
The obligation to document contract-award procedures complies with a basic requirement of the transparency principle that applies EU-wide.
Only a careful and timely documentation ensures transparency as to the contract-award decisions and the reasons underlying them. In particular, it ensures the effective legal protection of biddersâ interests in cases where the contract value exceeds the EU thresholds.
Due documentation is also an essential ingredient to corruption prevention since the obligation to give detailed justifications for contract-award decisions significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
In the case of EU-wide contract-award procedures, the contracting authorities have to notify all awards made under EU-wide contractaward procedures to the EUâs Office of Official Publications not later than 48 days after the contract award date.
The Office publishes the notifications in the EUâs Official Journal and thus also honours the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities must collect the essential data on their contract-award procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission produces annual statistics which enable it to obtain an overview of the development of the Single Market in the field of construction works.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have completely transposed into national law the provisions of EU law concerning documentation and notification.
The provisions on documentation and notification for the purpose of EU statistics are largely identical in both countries.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, the duty to publish contract awards does not only apply to EU-wide procurements but also to national contract-award procedures.
The deadline for notification is only 15 days.
In Germany, public announcement duties apart from those imposed by EU law apply only to restricted tendering exceeding a threshold of â¬25,000 and discretionary awarding of contracts (negotiated contracts) exceeding a threshold of â¬15,000 VAT excluded (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these thresholds and in the case of public tenders, only the participating enterprises are given information about the contract awards.
Basic audit findings
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the tendering procedures audited were not documented completly.
The contract award notices did not include all necessary information about e.g. reasons for product specifications and national regulations.
In the case of one tendering procedure, the contracting authority did not give any reason why it had awarded the contract to a bidder whose tender did not include obligatory proofs.
In a few cases, documentation of the contracting authorities did not include all records required for documenting the tendering procedure.
Publication of contract awards
In the case of some EU-wide tendering procedures, the contracting authorities failed to publish the contract award notices.
In the case of several tendering procedures, the proofs for the publication of contract award notices by the contracting authorities were missing.
Reporting duties
The statistical compilations reviewed included the required minimum information and had been produced and posted on a timely basis.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the construction administrations audited published the contract data of the completed tendering procedure.
In the case of one construction administration, however, these data were not published due to a communication error.
It took the construction administration half a year to notice the mistake.
As a result, contract data of the tendering procedures completed during that period were not published.
NKÃ
Documentation
In case of construction work connected with a large sports event considerable shortcomings in documentation in course of procurement procedure were found out, which concerned mainly incorrect data e.g. in evaluation committee records concerning the bid prices.
In adition, some of the minutes about the opening of envelopes were not signed.
Publication of contract awards
In case of repairs and maintenance of road construction projects, announcements of contracts awarded were distributed after the deadline, resp. they were not published.
Summarised findings
The provisions on documentation, reporting and notification implement the EU requirements and are largely identical in both countries.
This generally ensures the transparency of contract-award procedures and award decisions.
The Czech publication requirements are somewhat stricter than their German counterparts.
The examination revealed shortcomings substantially reducing the value of documentation and publication as a means of corruption prevention.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The construction authorities should further enhance the transparency of their contract award procedures and should fully meet reporting and notification requirements.
Summarised evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKU and the BRH focused on two issues which are essential both in the Czech Republic and in Germany for the awarding of public works contracts: the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.
The provisions of EU law provide the opportunity for international competition within the EU in order to create a European Single Market.
Measures designed to prevent corruption do not only aim at avoiding or at least reducing corruption. They are also to prevent financial damage and potential loss of confidence in the integrity of government.
The audit findings generated by the two SAIs with respect to the application of procurement law in both countries and the comparison of the respective provisions of procurement law provide an insight into the common and differing features that may be helpful for both countries in further developing their procurement law and its application.
Application of EU procurement law
Both countries have transposed into national law the EU legislation concerning the awarding of public works contracts.
Thus, an important common basis exists in both countries for the awarding of public works contracts and the compliance with the essential requirements in this field: competition; equal treatment of the participating enterprises and transparency of the contract award procedure.
The construction administrations of both countries have underpinned these requirements by partly very extensive administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has largely adopted the provisions on public works contracts requiring EU-wide tendering for those contract award procedures that are below the EU threshold and are therefore governed by national law.
However, the SAIsâ audits revealed that the construction administrations did not always fully comply with all relevant provisions of EU-law.
The construction administration in Germany should continue to improve the quality of its contract award procedures in order to eliminate the deficiencies pointed out with respect to the implementation of EU requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the audits furthermore identified the risks impacting on the value for money achieved in contract award procedures.
For instance, incomplete specification of the public contract subject, resulting in need of extra works, often awarded in contradiction to the law. Furthermore, insufficient specification of the expected price was provided. Also, qualification requirements limited the possible number of bidders, thus restricting competition, namely in the area of transport constructions.
Corruption prevention
Our audits did not aim at detecting cases of corruption.
One of the reasons was that the SAIs do not have the necessary tools at their disposal.
However, the SAIs can check whether the administrations of the two countries have adopted measures to curb corruption and manipulation in connection with awards of public works contracts and how these measures are applied.
In respect of corruption prevention, the two countries have focused on different aspects.
The German provisions mainly provide for largely unrestricted competition, transparency and checks as central elements of corruption prevention.
The Czech provisions mainly aim at increasing the transparency of the procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention are in place that apply to the entire federal administration.
These principles have also been implemented in the requirements for awarding public works contracts and have been adapted to meet the special needs of such contract awards.
The relevant provisions specify, partly with great precision, the ways in which the requirements of corruption prevention need to be met in the course of the contract award procedure and the selection of the persons involved in them.
In the BRHâs opinion, especially the principle that preference must be given to open procedures or public invitations to tender is a suitable tool for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in connection with the awarding of public works contracts, while restrictions of competition increase the risk of manipulation.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the cross-check principle), the requirements concerning transparency, the documentation of contract award procedures and various organisational measures are also effective mechanisms to prevent corruption and manipulation.
We therefore do not perceive any need for fundamental changes of the respective provisions public entities have to comply with when awarding public works contracts.
The provisions on corruption prevention are largely implemented in practice.
The deficiencies found in some areas have highlighted weaknesses in complying with some requirements.
Therefore, the construction administrations should offer further training to their staff to enhance their familiarity with the requirements for corruption prevention and further increase their awareness of this issue.
An essential part of the weaknesses highlighted referred to tasks which the construction administrations had delegated to self-employed professionals.
However, in the absence of adequate checks and controls, the delegation of tasks increases the risk of abuse.
Tasks vulnerable to manipulation and corruption should therefore only be assigned to third parties, if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against undue interference.
NKÃ
The Czech Republic adopted on governmental level the anti-corruption strategies which focus on public procurement.
Essential amendments of the Act on public contracts award and connecting implementation rules were made.
The NKÃ audits were carried out in the period of realization of this strategy.
The adopted strategy and new legal provisions may represent the efficient measures for improvement, whereas the contracting authorities have to justify effectiveness of public contracts, calculation of expected prices, adequacy of qualification requirements, definition of the basic evaluation criteria and the way of bid evaluation, and all that must be duly documented and published.
Recommendations
On the whole, the NKU and BRH have a favourable opinion about the way the EU requirements are implemented.
The fact that they are largely accepted in practice has confirmed that the EU requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are a suitable basis for awarding public works contracts within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union may also serve as a basis for similar projects designed to facilitate and encourage international competition.
In view of the enormous potential for material and ideal damage from manipulation and corruption in connection with the awarding of public works projects, both SAIs hold that it is the duty of the construction administrations to continue their measures against corruption and manipulation and, where possible, to improve them.
In particular, the organisational structures and processes of the contract award procedures should be monitored continuously for weaknesses and risks in order to identify and respond to any need for corrective action.
Comparison of the Czech and the German practice indicates that the volume of open procedures offering the large space for competition and substantially decreasing the chances of corruption acts should be enforced in the Czech Republic.
Also, an increased segmentation of construction work into lots may positively impact on achieved price, if it results in more competition due to a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of contract award procedures is an essential basis for efficient public sector procurement.
In Germany, the procedures are organized by special state institutions, while in the Czech Republic, except of the transport constructions, they are organized by central institutions themselves or by their contractual entities.
The SAIs of both countries wish to further develop the findings relevant to their work and, where appropriate, to raise the related issues with their respective Parliament and Government even beyond the completion of their joint project.
Furthermore, both SAIs are convinced that the principles of procurement law and their implementation described in this report are also matters of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), since the principles and findings expounded are of general importance for effectively curbing corruption and for ensuring that public works contracts are awarded under a regime of well-functioning and fair competition and that good value for money is obtained.

Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.
Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go again before the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
That is a lot of ifs, and I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how prolonged the struggle may be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d"Ã©tat against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that ensued.
The course of history pivots around such inflection points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or delayed.
Americans face several of these inflection points now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water ever since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his being unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times's account is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not full or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be in for a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna clash
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to greater things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.
Maybe we could have nicked it in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better side.
Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but that will be tough game because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push on and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there's a feelgood factor about the place now.
The squad's good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training's good.
Hopefully, we can push on now, put last season behind us and be successful."

Women are losing sleep over this retirement savings fear
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were speaking with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke with their kids about it.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they aren't taking the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to begin.
Talk to your spouse and the kids: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't make your wishes known well ahead of time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insuring with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Hammer out your legal documents: Head off legal battles at the pass.
Get a health-care proxy in place so that you designate a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you're unable to communicate.
Also, consider a power of attorney for your finances.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications knocked out, relief officials have not been able to get any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The regency, an administrative region below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia sits on the seismically Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major quake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that smashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, triggering up tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A shallow quake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded by the devastation of the deadly 2004 quake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Major quakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.

Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance attempted to call police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone from her.
Palin is being remanded in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, reported KTUU.
He appeared in court Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, for sure" when asked his plea, reported the network.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, meaning he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanour, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the report of a domestic violence crime, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had alleged that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.

Federal prosecutors seeking rare death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclist in his path on Oct.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those counts carry a possibly death sentence, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury slapped Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight charges of murder in aid of racketeering, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried it out as "heinous, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the notice of intent states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were both put to death by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He stated to investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.

Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to 'mobilise the people's army' today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to 'feel the heat' from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK 'would have been out' by now if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The premier is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted she will push ahead with trying to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'chuck Chequers'.
He suggested Mr Farage should have been made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand up for Brexit but we need to chuck Chequers.'
Setting out his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We didn't fight world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is completely untrue.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march, telling reporters: 'I am simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the Opposition's not going to vote for it, it's unpopular with our party and our activists who actually pound the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Please drop Chequers and start listening.'
In a pointed message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the rally politicians must be made to 'feel the heat' if they were about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'This is now about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with doing that'.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: 'I want you to make our political class, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
'We are mobilising the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A smattering of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with a party app as the conference opened.
'These are the people who tell us they can have the IT systems in place and all of the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It is a complete farce.
There isn't such a thing as a good Brexit,' he added.

Warren plans to take a 'hard look' at running for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she'll take a "hard look at running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might take on Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the town hall format since Trump took office.
An attendee asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders hand him win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes" team orders would play a large part in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack, something which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he held onto his tyres to target a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.
He eventually came into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman told let me by.

That Was Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "mean and nasty and untruthful."
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is going on over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people that are angry and mean and nasty and untruthful," he said.
"When you look at releases and leaks and then they say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait one minute.
Did we leak...No, we didn't leak," he added, in an impression of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to hold it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."

Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer hit two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars atoned for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead through strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home side level before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured their victory.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was a fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute on 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game on 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became provider for Cownie's equaliser on 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took a lead into the first break when he hit his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard once again put them on level terms with a power play goal on 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second period and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, are at home to Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.

Air Traffic Controller Dies To Ensure Hundreds On Plane Can Escape Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people made it safely off the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He stayed put to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in hospital.
Spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our heart breaks to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach the thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The toll is believed to be still increasing since many bodies were still under the wreckage while many have not able to be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.

This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking all of you to work day and night to complete every tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.

Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a release that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unable to account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon short of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"That's an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and yelling, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improving a wharf also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to shuttle people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.

Analyst lays out timeline of night woman was burned alive
The prosecution rested its case Saturday in the retrial of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined for the jury how he used cellphone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the evening of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported .
When data showed his cellphone was with Chambers' during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cellphone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
NY nanny sues couple over firing after "racist" text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a misdirected text from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny they are racist, likening the suit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when finding out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black upon arriving for her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her gaffe, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day of work and then sent home for an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation over the firing, and is seeking compensation to the tune of $350 a day for the six-month, live-in gig she had initially been hired to do, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do stuff like that," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have hit back at the claims that they are racist, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, fearing they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife had sent her something that she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Likening the suit to "extortion," Plasco said his wife was just two months off having a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're going to go after someone like that?
That's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media, slamming them for their behavior and logic.

Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn't relate to a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put oneself in the shoes of somebody reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's very amusing knowing now what we know about Paddington's huge success."
Saying her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a small toy bear, would have been sanguine about his work being rejected, she added the 60th anniversary of the books publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't a boastful person," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like if you have a child who achieves something: you're proud of them even though it's not your doing really.
I think he viewed Paddington's success sort of in that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give the credit to Paddington himself."

My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
On landing her daughter had been rushed to Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad was calling regularly to say it was really bad, that she wasn't expected to make it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say she was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly petering out and leaving her system.
She had died some time before hand and this was it all shutting down.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing this was all unfolding.
I couldn't howl or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to really hold it together."
Eventually Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, by now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside the other passengers - oblivious to the ordeal she was going through.
"No-one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and tears were falling the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."

Grieving women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering with depression and killed himself aged 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel everyday," she said.
Ms Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up any room."
However, he gave up work before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one to find his sibling after he had taken his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I continually worry that there's going to be a knock on effect."
Ms Davis created the cards, "to let people know there are people out there that you can go to and you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you need to talk."
Ms Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say that he was feeling down or depressed or anything," she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change in attitude.
He was at rock bottom on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents he didn't make eye contact with them or anything."
She said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to work through it: "It rips a hole through the family.
It tears us apart.
But we've all got to carry on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation
"I thought, if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation limited in time, limited in scope - we could maybe bring a little unity," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid entrenched partisan gridlock.
Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is all due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, lobbying them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It's still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.

North Korea defector numbers 'drop' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.
This came after June's historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.

Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times nearly shouting and choking up while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think that he disqualifies himself with those statements and the manner in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi demurred when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats gain the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he's not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions on whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to the court and expect us to say, 'isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.

"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's uncommon, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive someplace, who said she also cried when she got angry, but developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she'd say to the person she was talking to, "You may think I am sad because I am crying.

Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential runs.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and bowed out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, figured there was no reason she shouldn't explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," she said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.

She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions - gratitude for the people who'd supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at the sexism - that she got choked up.

How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (Â£150 billion) worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in kind, most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade war pressures could positively support China over the long term by lowering the inter-dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic tailspin in either country is actually a lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.

Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it's ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven-year long war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
