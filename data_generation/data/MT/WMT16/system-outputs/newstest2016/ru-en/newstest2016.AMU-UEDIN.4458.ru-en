During a call to 911 teacher admits to killing girlfriend
During the 911 call, almost without a voice teacher Shannon Lamb told police that the school tremhas shot his girlfriend and what needed employees who would come home to them.
Lamb stressed that the house has a "pösik," which is alive, but probably upset, and said that the contacts of family members who died can be found in her phone.
Inside the house, police discovered the body of Amy Prentiss and a note carelessly written off his hands on a white piece of paper: "I'm very sorry, I would like to line everything in the back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," the note said, according to the authorities, signed by Lambom.
There is nothing to indicate that, who has conducted two online courses at the University of Delta Lamb in Cleveland, Mississippi, had managed to travel for 300 miles into a university campus where, according to police, he shot all respected teacher history Itana Schmidt on the doorstep of his cabinet.
University of Delta police chief Lynn Buford reported that university staff found out about the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
He reported that he made the truthful call to 911 shortly after the Lamb.
By the end of the day, the victims will prove one more: as soon as the police surrounded him, Lamb committed suicide.
The next day, after the shooting at the training facility forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, officials were still trying to fold into one picture of the motives that led Lamba.
The information, which was shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped create a portrait of a talented, but perhaps anxious teacher.
The students were told that they were really looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gotye, where Prentiss died, reported that no charges of violence or criminal counts for him.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in a book written by him, in which he expressed his gratitude to the "wonderful people," with whom he had crossed in his teaching life.
They both taught at the faculty of social sciences and history, which counts 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for the emergence of problems.
One student, who had good cheer about Lambe, Brandon Bivers said he also seemed worried and nervous, "as if something had been raised with him not in order."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that at the end of the academic year 2014-15 told Lamb about how he struggled with stress.
He had previously asked the University of Delta to provide sick leave for Lamb, saying that he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only at two online courses.
Recent changes in university employment rules meant that the degree of doctor who worked so hard on getting that job would not guarantee him an automatic teacher Lamb.
University President William Laforges said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lambom and Schmidt, but "obviously Mr Lamba had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to respond.
Police attacked Lamba trail after his escape from campus when he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before they were able to arrest him, Lamb shot himself from charging 38 caliber guns left in the back yard of noone mile south of his parents' home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi home, told county coroner Washington metel Johnson.
His car with the engine running still stood on the access road.
It was unclear why Lamb came to this house, unskilled, though, according to Johnson, she believes that he knew people who were living in it.
Lamb grew up in those edges.
He began working at the university, which counts 3,500 students in Lamb in the city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received a doctorate in pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One longtime friend Lamba described him as a smart, charismatic and cheerful person.
Carl Hairston said that she was 15 and 20 years old, when they were introduced through mutual friends from Lamb.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool guy, who for several years tried to teach her she would play the guitar.
In those years, he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls melt when he was there," said Hairston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, suburban Brandon.
And Prentiss at the time of events, apparently, Lamb had already met for some time.
During a call to 911, Lamb said: "I killed my wife but there is no record of their marriage registration."
The couple had dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gotye in a brick house, the flip side of which goes to the canal.
According to police, with the dog all right.
The former husband of Prentiss, Sean O'Steen, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but have remained friends, and that they have a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She's totally devastated," O'Steen said about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he had not met, but heard from his daughter EbigLambale that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at the concerts.
O'Steen said that his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online at different companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and part-time coordinator for entertainment programs in the dimly lit bar The Julep Room in the suburb of Gotye, said that the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing the guitar and harmonica for a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and were teaching each other over stuffed.
In the sense that they were both very smart.
Schmidt, who died a teacher, conducted seminars for freshmen and specialized in Native American history and colonial America," said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same institution.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student government.
The campus of Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday evening about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and community members, took part in a memorial ceremony of lighting the candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to return our students," Laforges said.
Crisis passed.
Today is the day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Reporting helped to prepare the Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material has been edited in connection with a police statement saying that the call Lamba entered the service 911 after Schmidt's murder, as well as due to the fact that while his wife and spoke about Prentiss as the Lamb, when they called 911, information about whether they were married, was not confirmed.

Michael J. Fox jokes about "meeting" with Princess Diana
The movie premiere of "Back to the Future" turned out to be a great event for Michael J. Fox.
It was remarkable even for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema and waited for the arrival of members of the royal family, I noticed that my place was next to me freely, and then overshadowed next to me will sit Princess Diana," he said in his trailer for the documentary "Back will soon be published in time" screens.
The film begins, and here I come to mind that I am literally at arm's length and in a fake zevke from meeting with Princess's Welsh.
"back in time" - a documentary about the movie "Back to the Future" - includes interviews with Fox, Lia Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemekis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The movie premiere of "Back to the Future" took place 30 years ago.
"For me," Spielberg says, is unquestionably the greatest movie about travel in time that has ever been filmed."
"back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says in response to Russia's military support for Syria, which for an almost five-year conflict "a military solution does not exist," and an increase in weapons will only aggravate the violence and suffering for millions of people.
The U.N. chief once again urged all participants, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations which was shared to find a political solution.
Mr Ban said at a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the ministers of foreign affairs of the five permanent council members - the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that divisions within the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities "made the situation intractable."
Ban Ki-moon urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they showed when addressing the issue of the Iran nuclear program, and when dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results, which show that Donald Trump doesn't jokes
Some tried to hang on him a shortcut to the puller.
Others have shrugged off the him, taking up as a joke.
And some require a scandal.
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to shake Donald Trump's high standing in poll results, they failed (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's advantage in double-digit numbers, and some are beginning to seriously ask what it means for the real estate tycoon in terms of chances to get the nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance for Republican nominees.
Experts pointed out that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry had succumbed to his prechesin gaining popularity with Herman Keim, none of whom has not won him and one state well during the nomination.
And there are plenty of reasons why he would want to fight the general election.
But outside groups, such as the "Supercommittee" and Jeb Bush's economic and foreign policy conservative assembly group recognize Trump's unrelenting power of "growth" and families are starting to get their dollars to topple him.
Here are some poll numbers that suggest that the property magnate is not just an interim phase:
The ratings of sympathy for Trump turned around 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll by Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive attitude to this real estate tycoon.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive attitude towards Donald Tramp.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators are victories over the initial stages.
The Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of Republicans are there to put.; Tramp
Two-thirds of those who voted for the GOP would have made Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/Orc poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "pleased" or with "enthusiasm," if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "disappointed" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would react "with delight" versus 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trempe).
The next level of delight?
Marco Rubio, who has just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they would be "not satisfied" or "upset" if establishment favourite Jeb Bush will be the nominee.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temperament problem.
While Trump massively criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent inclined to Republican voters across the country, think the magnate suitable temperament to be president, as ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted on Monday showed.
The same figure appears on the country's first closed-door meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he is the man who could be the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent think he is not a man who can be effective in the post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Izbirately-Republicans get used to that thought.
When they wear their hats of connoisseurs, elected Republicans think Trump is seriously prodigy.
When asked who is the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was the favourite, according to a CNN/Orc poll last week.
It is no longer the case, when four out of 10 put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have previously not been properly magical Cristal.
At the same time in the last cycle of cycle four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported the eventual candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it shows that many GOP voters believe Trump's campaign is convincing.
Even if Republicans would have rallied around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some pundits point out that this variation is likely to play at Trump's advantage, and at the same time not supporting Trump evenly distributed among supporting more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical competition "one on one" between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He outscored Carli Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio on 14 points, Walker on 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and, finally, Randa Paul, John Keisich and Chris Christie on 33 points.
He has a draw with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson overtook the businessman on entire 19 points in a hypothetical competition "one by one."
A little more than half of Donald Trump's supporters say that they have changed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT poll, conducted Tuesday, shows that just over half of voters supporting Trump say they are confident in their voices.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump's most tense competition from the rain at the moment - with queasy outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson St, but voters who say that they have changed their mind is more likely to choose Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump over immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called immigrants from Mexico as "rapists" in his speech opening campaign, the topic of immigration has become the most urgent in our conversations in 2016.
Some worry that Trump's posturing would undermine key voter Hispanics from the Republican Party and turn away rebranding.
But according to the ABC/Post poll conducted Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So, until immigration draws widespread attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Frustration with the government is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on support from about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status ers-outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they'd rather want a political outsider than a person with experience in government.
And they are also hurt at Washington.
Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa disappointed the activities of Republicans in Congress, while 54 percent were "unsatisfied," and 21 percent "furious."
The government will decide the fate of indexations of pensions in October.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options to enforce law on indexation of pensions in 2016 on the real level of inflation, reports the WG.
She noted that a solution should be found by October 8, by the time of the budget draft for next year to make the government.
In addition, Kabmin discusses the option of prolongation of decision to freeze accumulative pension of Russians.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings is equal to 350 billion rubles.
Roughly the same amount is worth the indexation of pensions in full for the next year.
According to the vice premier, as long as there is no final decision on the issue, who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Golodets believes that if a person does not work on their own initiative and does not apply to the socially vulnerable categories of citizens, while not quite rightly that it pays for society.
Earlier, media reported that two options for balancing the state budget is viewed in kabmine.

Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to cope with the refugee problem, then they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The issue is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that needs to eliminate the root causes of the problem.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of the refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
It is our opinion on this issue.
"In this essence of the issue of refugees," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible, as long as the bloodshed continues, as long as people are dying and as long as people do not feel safe.
"Thus, we can reach a consensus, but we cannot realize anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad said.
We would like to remind you that about 500 thousand migrants arrived in the EU this year, including those from Syria.
The European Commission has said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since World War II.

Residents of the German city staged a holiday for the refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become a leader in refugee intake, although recently it has strengthened border controls to stem their influx.
Authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany until the end of this year, although some experts call significantly larger figures.

BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the town of Darmstadt, whose residents have a very warm welcome to migrants.
Jeremy Corbyn debuts in session of Prime Minister questions
After the election of Mr Corbyn on his debut at the session questions the Prime Minister is expected to look great
The new Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will soon be in session for the first time Prime Minister, for the first time by merissues forces with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will perform with the first of six allocated questions during the second half of the day; his performance is likely to be closely follow the press and members of the Parliament from the Labour Party.
He issued a call for "less theater and more facts" at the weekly demonstration speech.
He also said he could miss some meetings, leaving their colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn as leader; it will happen after the appointment of his shadow cabinet and speech at the annual congress of trade union locations Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silently during the performance of the national anthem at the service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of Battle for Britain has provoked criticism from some conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several advanced articles in newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has garnered attention
A spokeswoman for Mr Corbyn said he "stood in respectful silence" and admitted "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC Two that he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his conviction of the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to play in Mr Corbyn's team, voicing disagreements on issues of economy, defense and international politics, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party members backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also "digging up" in the Labour Party after his appointment of Mr Corbyn's office in the European Union and restrictions on government compensation payments.
Mr Corbyn said at a conference of trade union that the Labour Party has made amendments aimed at harvested the very idea of restrictions in general cancellation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, said the party had "full clarity" on account of the fact that it exists in opposition to government plans to reduce the upper limit with only 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr Corbyn will become the fifth Labour leader, with whom David Cameron will meet the "express" over the past decade's box since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, declares that he "drew collective resources" in order to gain an idea Mr Cameron questions and received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from Aylington Nort District stated that Prime Minister questions cause excessive confrontation, and that he would refrain from witty responses and exchange knees, instead promising to focus on serious issues of bones, such as poverty, inequality and challenges to the youth.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the economy minister in shadow cabinet, will replace him on matters of prime minister, when he will be absent - for example, when removing Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of letting other colleagues take the word when possible, saying that he was referring to John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the issue.
Becoming leader in 2005, Mr Cameron has said he wants to move away from the political style of "vintage Balagan," often ar associated with the procedure, but admitted a few years later that he questions the Prime Minister did not succeed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, the prime minister has become a key indicator of the leader's views and questions their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has turned into a caricature and requires major reforms.

The pound rose against a backdrop of wage growth in the UK, under the FTSE 100 rose thanks to a proposal for the purchase of SABMiller.
From May to June earnings in the UK, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
The growth rate was the highest since 2009, and was seen as moving to an earlier period of projections on potential growth of quotes.

The FTSE 100 rose to 6,229.21 at 1.49 per cent.
SABMiller shares were allocated on the general background, which grew by 20% thanks to a proposal to buy from rival AB InBev has received.
The deal would combine the two largest brewing companies in the world, having collected such brands as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares rose 0.9 per cent against the backdrop of an encouraging news under rival group of luxury goods makers Richemont.
Recent data on Richemont sales exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - began to grow again.

Shares of paper and packaging group Mondi were leaders of falling production in indexes - 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs lowered the group's rating to "sell."
Shares of JD Sports rose after the company - a sports apparel provider reported an 83-percent growth in profit before tax for six months to 46.6 million pounds.
The boss of JD Sports says that higher wages may prevent expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Caugill says raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power outweigh the rising cost of labour costs, he says.
Costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash is launching a campaign on the initiative from below to fight the onslaught of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
Wholesale food supplier on the initiative from below has launched a campaign to protect the market share of the IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of the upcoming $700 million injection by Aldi.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social networks and at events like the "Adelaide Show.
The campaign to join retailers and IGA suppliers, such as ice-cream maker Simmo's of Dansborough, which offers tastings at IGA stores, and shop owners selling discounted tickets to the South Australian Football League matches regular customers.
Metcash is expected to expand more details of its defense strategy on September 29 - a day when will this wholesale supplier of food, alcoholic drinks and household goods will hold its annual investor day strategies.
Much is at stake, as in South Australia and Western Australia stores under the IGA brand account for nearly 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as followers of the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for the IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in JA and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will turn 5 percent of the food market in these two states declared within 12 months after opening its first stores, taking sales from all present players, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes that the IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year, and Metcash - $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA, having achieved sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
Loss of revenue and food sales volumes at high levels of fixed costs Metcash could cost the company about 13 million earnings before paying interest and taxes, says Mr Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and that's what a recent study at the company Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
At Morgan Stanley think Metcash food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, at 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading stock manager Hamish Дуглass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, spotted attending a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash "may be highly likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash has refused to publicly comment on the comments made by Mr Дуглassa.
But it is expected that a member of the Board of Directors of Metcash contacted Mr Douglassom last week.
The share of IGA on the market has declined from 18 to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash revenues from business in the food sector, which the company delivers approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, fell by 43 per cent compared to 2012 due to operational performance and due to pressure on sales and profitability делеверija.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually for equalization of retail prices with prices at Coles and Woolworths over a thousand positions weekly and helping IGA retailers in trading platforms, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of reconstituted fresh products and a broader selection of branded food.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says that the equalization of prices and re-equipment of retail space is gaining momentum, and hopes that the company will achieve an increase in net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supports Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves the honor, rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis indirectly suffered in the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kyryos and for his behaviour deserves the honor more than critics, says Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a junior in the talented duo and often called "Special KS," unwittingly found himself in the spotlight because of the shameful Kiriosa shouting matches with Stan Vavrinka at Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after that, during the hot qualifying match in Cincinatti judge the tower had to twice get to Kokkinakis and his opponent standing Ryan Harrisona, while Harrison said: "Wawrinka had to lay on the blades of Kiriosa, and I should lay paddles this guy."
Since Kokkinakis last seen breaking his racket after which cramp in his leg saved Rishara Gasquet from possible defeat at the US Open, Hili devotedly protects Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groupon for being eligible to be second to Bernard Tomic in the singles semi-finals of the Davis Cup against Britain.
"I badly worry about one thing, namely that Tanashi pulled into conflict," Healy said.
He really broke a racquet when he got his leg at the US Open, but he was not the first player swing, which broke his racket when broke down, and I know Tanashi well enough to hope that he would not be proud of this to be sure.
But in fact he owned himself very well in quite provocative situations at US, with Harrisons, etc., and I'm sure he deserves trust.
He is surrounded by a great team, he has a wonderful family, and I just think that with him came a little bit dishonest.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he has a lot of work, perfectly fits into the team, he has never had a problem with other players, his respect outside the court, he's intense, he's in excellent shape, he's a very dedicated train and developed young man, and I think that made him should be assessed on its merits.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiriosa for the sake of an important match starting on Friday, believing "mutual consent" the right way out for everyone, but counting that guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want to make sure that the team is fully focused on the match rather than the debate around [Kiriosa]," Healy said.
And I think that Nick gained momentum very quickly, which prove people like Federer and Marraya, he grows in front of the audience, he made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the implications of their actions, and necessary, I believe, to withdraw it from the center of attention for some time so he can reflect on them, and it's best for the team and best for him.
Migrant crisis in Europe: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, delays migrants
Announcing a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia at the southern border and delays those trying to enter the country illegally to stem the flow of migrants flowing inside.
There were hundreds of migrants at the border on the border territory - inflamed unrest that Serbian authorities sharply reacted negatively.
Anchored in indefinitely at the site between the two countries' border crossing points, the road people fleeing armed violence at home, smashed tents and settled in the area.
But discontent was growing.
When a police helicopter was circling above them, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian police special.
Some abandoned food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared "unacceptable" deportation of migrants back from Hungary, when they are more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, rather than collateral damage.
It is necessary in the coming days to negotiate with Brussels and other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border began the next day after a block of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to bear overall responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in crowded Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that the future (in the next month or by the end of the year) would have reached an agreement under which EU members would take another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded to gather next week an emergency EU summit to discuss the immigration crisis engulfing the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for quick action on the part of Brussels or old neighbors.
Announced on Tuesday a state of emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to act in relation to the crisis, which allowed them to shut down roads and speed up court cases of asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Sijarya said his country also plans to build a fence from the barbed wire fence on the border with Romania to halt the flow of migrants through the land, now that it has finished the fence on the Serbian border country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were connected to urgent work on completion of the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main "bottleneck" and EU border crossing point for migrants, many of whom are refugees - victims of war in Syria and Middle East countries.
Nevertheless, the country's Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants, looking for a more prosperous life rather than refugees - the victims of military action, which are entitled to protection, and this view is sharply at odds with the opinions of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which joined in Hungary into force at midnight, now considered a crime crossing or damage to a 4-meter (13-foot) fence of barbed wire, the government-built port along the southern border with Serbia, as well as include longer prison terms for those accused of trafficking.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We clearly make it clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally parliament still must authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters, who are on the border, has already been there for several days watching the presence of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs.
Orban's Bakondi, an adviser to Djerring on national security, said the authorized bodies of 45 people caught attempting to cross the border, and another 15 people - inside the country.
They crossed the border, breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under new laws.
Authorities quickly restore the fence.
Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of seven passes on the border with Serbia, ready to block one of the passes a railway carriage, unwrapping a barbed wire.
Riots broke out at the main passage across the border near the town of Rioske (Hungary), as Hungarians posted an official premises for missing people inside a metal container, and crowds of people pressed each other to break inside.
About 20 persons managed to get inside, while thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway leading from Serbia into Hungary, and declared the race to refuse food and water until they did not miss from Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the Democratic race for nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent among Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders-goes second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent hers).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to participate in the presidential race, gets the support of 15 percent of Democratic primary voters ers-.
For more than five months before the primary election rivalry most elected Democrats say it is too early to talk about ers-what they have determined with the candidate who will support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in his choice, rather than support ering other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost the support of some of the demographic groups, while Sanders has made some sort of bonuses.
Clinton holds a big advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has dwindled.
Its support among men has fallen substantially, and Sanders lags behind it by just 5 points.
The preference for Clinton elected Democrats up to 50 years, disappeared, and ers-they are now on an equal footing with Sanders.
But Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digit numbers among liberals, but Sanders now has an advantage of five points in this group.
Nearly half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they ers-enthusiastically would support Clinton if she became a candidate from the party.
A quarter would have supported her with some reservations, and a further 15 per cent would support her just because she's a candidate.
Six per cent would not have supported her.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm at her expense.
Among those who are currently not supporting Clinton, her views are more controversial - only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton ers-fewer voters, Republicans say the same about their leaders-era, Donald Trempe (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters set an open question as to why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that now is time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 percent).
Also, Clinton supporters talk about an association linking her with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also called agreed not on issues and chances of election.
Because the vice president is contemplating potential participation in elections, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to join the race ers-- though a third believe that he should not be.
When asked whom they would like to see them in second place among candidates from the party, the primary voter Democrats in most cases called Biden's prodigy.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half said they would have chosen Biden second, it is more than that of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to present his candidacy from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among participants in the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton the candidate with the best shansers-in to win the general election; however, this figure has dropped from 78 percent in the past month.
By this measure, Biden with a big lag in second place, but the percentage of those who considered him the most likely candidate, has increased.
Nevertheless, answering the question, what is most important in a candidate, elected Democrats choose other options besides the chance of being ers-elected.
Similarly to the situation last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates is not acceptable nominee for these primary voters.
The Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among primary voters from his party.
The majority believes Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden from all three leads on honesty, and Clinton's strong side in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy ers-, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent don't have a certain opinion about him on this score.
The primary voter Democrats also generally consider similar ideological views ers-Clinton, Sanders and Biden.
By all these measures around a quarter of Democratic voters do not have any opinion about ers-Sanders.
Although questions about Hillary Clinton's personal email account and server during her Secretary of State have continued, a majority of Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation on this account and ers-believe that this has not had a negative impact on their overall opinion about it.
But it's a completely different story from the American public in general.
Half of Americans today are not satisfied with her explanation, but only about one-third are satisfied.
Public opinion about this split back in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy over the email did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
It's mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who argue that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers fair and credible voters from her party, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points lower compared to the previous month, and at 15 compared with May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters did not consider her honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump fair and credible.
Clinton and Trump both, however, are getting good marks on the leadership qualities.
Of the six tested Biden candidates, Carson and Bush are showing the best result for honesty.
Most see the Sanders more honest man than not, but, as Carson, many do not have any opinion about him.
The limit of error for a sample of 351 primary electers-Democrats is 6 percentage points.
Based on national survey, Ben Carson closely approached Donald Tramp
Ben Carson came close to Donald in the latest CBS/New York Times poll Tramp
Two of those candidates won half the votes in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of a pillar beneath their feet
Election Republicans across the country continue to massively support Trump's prodigy, whose percentage of support has increased from 23% in a recent CBS News poll conducted on the eve of the debate on Fox News last month, up to 27 per cent in the poll conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson has soared from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoys support across all demographic groups, having Trump in a group of Republican electers-Logistics with higher education.
The rest of the candidates, except for Carli Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, have rolled back together with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10% in the past month to er 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Senator from Florida Marco Rubio together occupy third place with 6%.
The limit of error for a sample of 376 elected Republicans in this latest poll is ers-plus or minus 6%, the survey was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson's rise in the polls - demonstrating the support of 19% among Republicans, behind Trump with 32 percent support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.
In relation to the rise of Carson's support last week, Trump made several critical attacks against a former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for having questioned Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a closing campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are accused in death of Baruch College freshman
About two years later, after the death of a college student during a ritual initiation into a fraternity at Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania the murder charges against five people were nominated.
"The members of the fraternity Pi Delta Pi from New York's Baruch College brutally attacked Chan "Michael" Denga during a ceremony in September 2013 and not taken him during initiation at the hospital, causing his death," the police said.
Officials say a student blindfolded and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back several times pushed while he was trying to reach a goal by going on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the fraternity Pi Delta Psy did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and waited another hour before delivery to the hospital reportedly told police.
They, however, found time to change Denga's clothes, found in Gugl symptoms and contact Andy Menga, national president of the fraternity, to ask the council, as police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, members of the fraternity began to hide personal possessions, essentially putting the welfare of brotherhood above the health of Michael Denga," said chef Vagner.
They were unable to save him and he died the next morning.
According to a report on the showdown, he received several blunt head injuries, Deng torso and hips.
"Too many families have suffered as a result of a fraternity initiation ritual, since at least one student dies during them every year since 1970," said in a statement, Douglas Fierberg, an attorney representing the family of Deng.
Fraternities and their members should be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Jurors in Monroe County bent in favour of third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will receive the charge of violence against a newcomer and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned it all formally or informally, then," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and nationwide fraternity excluded from its structure the local branch.
What will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
The rate hike will happen, and "bull market" stumbles, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
That we know.
What we don't know is how much time will pass before the offensive, and how long it will continue.
Specifically for the economy, there is little that explains the story about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate increase and by as much as 86 months.
The stiffness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the administration of the US Central Bank so strongly emphasizes that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, but on how much adaptation will take.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss around raising rates turns out to be exaggerated.
"The first increase in rates by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of an era of "cheap money," said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, in his comments specialist for clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low levels will be seismic pulse, which many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy may react depending on historical trends:
As the market has already seen over the last month or so, anticipation of rate hikes could lead to instability for some time.
When raising rates, however, the consequences are not typically dramatic.
"The non-profits seem to share a brake on 12-24 months after the first jump and that, again, probably reflects the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the results of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
If more specifically, the market for the past roughly 35 years is more likely to dramatically change - about 14 percent toward rate hikes, remains fairly smooth over 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal with an average yield of 14.4 percent over the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob Dolle, chief specialist at Nuveen Asset Management Strategy Sales, published in Barron's stable.
Deutsche said that the result for securities tends not to immediately become more pronounced at the stage of raising rates, and earnings from shares are starting to shrink.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but raising rates often encourage them to play.
In this case, the Federal Reserve has been in such conditions, which did not exist before and could precipitate a recession.
Basically, gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point ever increased rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 cases increase in rates since 1950 only twice nominal annual GDP was ya below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent during the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it is for a long time, with only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed holds around.
Raising rates on such an unstable economic background may be risky and raises the question of "whether this time will be different," Deutsche said.
Market participants are preparing to raise Federal Reserve rates all year round, while their eyes riveted to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many experts on strategies and economists believe that the FOMC could approve a rate hike at this meeting, futures trade talks about only a 25-percent probability.
"In our study, since 1950, all the cycles of rate hikes until today were in the supercycle of increasing financial leverage in GDP, overlapping peaks, before recession, very quickly after we started their recovery," the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle at the moment - the longest, which the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the most recent recession; the record was 35 months, it only lasts for 74 months already and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market expects to raise rates, and this scenario is somehow similar to that which is being implemented for the shares.
The main difference is that the effect will come faster for bonds than for stocks when the Fed changes the strategic course.
In case of bonds it seems that yields change the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease of rates in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of rising rates, bond yields will immediately fall," Deutsche says.
Strategy specialists from Charles Schwab believe that raising rates would lead to the fact that levels of long-term and short-term bond yields will converge, making the curve more flat.
High-yield bonds often behave better in this climate, although "we are still dangerous in profitability," said Kathy Jones, fluctuations in fixed income research analyst at Schwab.
It is interesting that Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the policy of the Federal system.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has been building towards the prospect of tighter monetary policy will," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, yield curve more flat, credit spreads widened, volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when tightened policy of the Federal system.
Speaking in general, companies in the United States, leading their main business, would benefit from rising interest rates and local production will become more attractive.
International companies with lots of debt will be worse off, because the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, and their debt more expensive - in fiscal space.
"History shows that "quality" stocks demonstrate efficiency above market within three months after the initial rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Companies with stable financial condition outperformed companies with unstable condition based on the results of each rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004, by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high yield capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also showed better performance than shares of low quality, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt is going to be a big question.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to the purely exchange deals, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Depositors could also see profits through higher yields, though experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM," says a member of parliament from Conservative Andrew Bingham
From Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "declining standards"
Proves that she is becoming less different from commercial competitor able
Also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award was simply a soda wound with Brits
A colleague at Parliament Damien Collins, on The Voice with as much criticism, was not befallen original
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," said the leader of members of parliament, prompting a broadcasting company to prove that she is doing anything that does not make commercial companies.
A member of parliament from the Conservatives, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC's leadership that it seems as if the public radio station "foolish" and becomes less distinct from its commercial rival gets interesting.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "simplification" - but it seems that it is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He was also aiming to win the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - here are two examples that I first came to mind, in which you actually just copy what you already have on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
BBC director-general rejected the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and education audiences.
What I find out thanks to Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and creating music really doesn't match any more with anyone.
"Also really very important, I think the interest of Radio 3 in search of new music and in promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3's manager Alan Davey argued that radio stations have to work much harder to attract an audience than in the past, because Britons are less educated in classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only brainchild of the BBC, which has suffered attacks for coming on heels of the commercial rivals during a hearing by a special committee of culture, media and sport.
A member of parliament from Tori Damien Collins has attacked The Voice - a music talent show, which the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of £22 million.
You can see why this program has often been discussed in relation to the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall argues that the BBC 1 show, in which judges participate by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was done in a "typical BBC style."
He added that he wants from the Corporation to "find the hit in his own home stables" the next time she won't be running a leisure project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent future new seasons of The Voice, or use the money order who pays the license fee for other entertainment formats.
Online sales growth slowed in August, and blame may be the best Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015 there has been an increase in online sales by seven per cent
Last month marked the slowest growth since it began to watch for in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could help curb spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping experiences a boom, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of aligning online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven-percent increase over the first three months of 2015.
Overall spending on online shopping in August showed minimal growth since they began to pick up in 2000, increasing by just five per cent.
Experts say there are now signs of aligning online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven-percent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at growth rates in previous years and return back to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said the Guardian's Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales indices.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago, when buyers were using their mobile phones to shop.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do it in any circumstances, for example, sitting on the couch.
But now it goes out on the plateau, and you can see the decline (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, the number of buyers at five times the average rushed to computers in order to be able to take advantage of lucrative offers, thereby having struck a number of sellers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers come into a real fight over lucrative purchases, could force people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, a little more than 1 pound out of every 5 is spent online.
With regard to goods such as televisions and washing machines, then more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, rather than in fashionable shops in central streets.
Muslims bury the dead at falling crane in Mecca, and bin Laden's family imposed sanctions
Muslims will carry bodies of 29 victims through the streets as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time Saudi Arabia partly laid the blame for the accident at construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Department of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapse
Hundreds of Muslims from everywhere flocked to the streets to bury the 29 victims who died as a result of the crane collapse on the main mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mostly in white, who attended the funeral to pay tribute to the traffic area flocked to the first of the death toll, which went into its final path at Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession walked past the sacred site, where just a few days earlier the construction crane struck the mosque ceiling and fell upon the parishioners.
The bodies were issued for funerals, and at the same time King Saudits fined a construction company owned by bin Laden's family, for the accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who died in crash crane at the main mosque was carried through the streets
Among those killed was the father of four children Kasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was in his first the pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr Akram was in the main mosque along with his parents before the start of the annual hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already pledged that the Hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said that Binladin Group should not have left the crane was raised when not working. small cranes
The Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said that Binladin Group bears partial blame for collapse.
The English edition of the news agency has not commented on the details, but said that the company's leaders were banned from travelling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the cause of the crane collapse into the yard of the main mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to this month to travel to the Hajj.
Binladin Group has not made any statements about the crane collapse, and its representatives were unavailable for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improper approvals for action along with meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround Mekki Main Mosque as part of large-scale construction works, which leads the Binladin Group.
Bin Laden's family for decades enters the number of Saudi Arabia's ruling family and leads major building projects close.
The late Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a synom-traitor, from which the family rewrote back in the 1990" s.
The accident happened during strong winds and rain in just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about 174 000 pounds) to the relatives of those killed, and the same amount was irreversibly severed.
Other victims will receive half that amount.

Because, according to the owner of B & Q, Britons still hire professional artists to perform simple chall work at home.
Veronique Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a network of services for the construction of houses, said a substantial influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe stands behind this trend, offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in products for masters, and at the same time close 60 stores of B & Q stores
Mrs Laurie said she would like to see more women in the B & Q store staff as eight out of ten decisions about purchases in store are accepted spokeswomen of weak gender.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to her, one cannot ignore and recent demographic trends, characterized by the fact that there is a growing number of households consisting of single women who are more engaged in the arrangement of their homes than in the past.
Mrs Laurie said: "In our stores are still mostly men.
Steps need to be taken to achieve balance.
In total, half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of decisions on purchased goods are taken by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Lori is one of five women standing at the helm of leading British companies whose shares are taken into account in the FTSE100 indexes - also having changed the team of top managers, among the directors of equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 per cent of managers are women, including the CEO and CFO.
Mrs Laurie said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
It was easy to find suitable women in the board of directors.
After the group assumed the costs of closing stores, Kingfisher company showed lower profit and sales volumes for six months.
As a result of this trend Kingfisher, which owns the brands Screwfix and B & Q, opens up to 200 new stores
Time for the US Federal Reserve's interest rate decision
The world is watching the Federal Reserve Bank meeting, which is held within two days of its adoption of an important decision - to raise or no interest rate discussed for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters revealed that just over half of those who were still last week believed that the Fed would go on, now believe that it is still temporary and will retain the current range of 0-0.25 per cent rate at the level set.
This is a historic event, because it has been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching that the main bank may move from zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has been working effectively, economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to balance report, and inflation is not fair.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned markets that they should prepare themselves for change, but everyone talks about their confidence that all the odds are against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 8pm CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go into the EU via Croatia.
"open!" - chanting hundreds of refugees at the border checkpoint of Khorgos on Serbo-Hungarian.
Budapest on Tuesday shut down the border for migrants.
Asylum seekers are already starting to forgive other variants of routes into the EU fell.
One of them to bypass the closed border with Serbia lies through Romania.
The other is through Croatia and Slovenia - in Austria.
According to some sources, the buses that were carrying refugees from Serbia into Hungary are now heading to the town of Shidou on the Croatian border.
Drivers were given an order from authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovich assures that his country is doing its best to help refugees, but of her possibilities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people provide a humane attitude towards them.
But this is a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve, no country in Europe alone with this, and especially as a small country, it does not handle Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is adamant:
If someone is called a refugee in Serbia, he should fill in the necessary documents.
And if he does, he will not let in our country, because it is quite safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already led the 175-meter fence on the border with Serbia. thyl
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to build a similar fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that it is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Memarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Memarakis was a member of the center-right government for several years, according to the Left, the country that led to the financial crisis.
Now he, becoming the interim leader of the New Democracy party, is being challenged by Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with Euronews journalist.
Euronews: Mr Maymarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Memarakis: thank you for your invitation.
Euronews: nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by conceding a SYRIZA coalition, but now, judging by the polls, "New Democracy" was compared with it in popularity.
What has changed over that time?
Vangelis Memarakis: Greece has changed, and we are too.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece was a budget surplus and growth prospects.
Now the country's fiscal deficit and high unemployment have once again.
Investors were gone because Mr Tsipras chased them.
For the past nine months, Greeks have had a chance to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and Mr Tsipras's false promises.
And now they can easily compare the promised with what actually happened.
Daily life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and it concerned the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: but you say that in the event of an election victory will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZu.
Vangelis Memarakis: the point is that, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where there were or still are rescue programmes, political forces and all ruling parties came together to implement a program on which they reached agreement without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: your party voted in support of the agreement between Mr Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Memarakis: we actually voted for Greece's movement on the European path, because it is good to represent the country's exit from the EU, which would have caused devastating consequences.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, Juncker's package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would be lost if there was no agreement with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were a result of how Mr Tsipras has been negotiating.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government during the first year in power wants to impose order, acts rationally and makes clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the bailout program, then, I am sure, all accepted commitments that cannot be fulfilled because lead to recession may again become the subject of negotiations, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be a mistake to assume that already in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to the talks with our creditors as they await the full implementation of an agreement.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue to privatise, reform and structural changes that were agreed, continuing to benefit from EU funding and large investment opportunities, which we must open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of negotiations, Tsipras's government has not submitted any serious arguments on many key policy issues that we've learned, discussing these issues with our European counterparts.
I can cite an example related to the income of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that we are not talking about a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot fully be taxed in advance.
We responded that Tsipras's ministers never talked about it.
That is, Greek ministers were not prepared and ill-informed, and therefore poorly negotiated and concluded a failed agreement.
Euronews: if you win the election, you will soon find yourself at the same table with Mr Juncker, Hollande, Ms. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will it be different from what you say, what you tell them your predecessor Antonis Samaras?
Vangelis Memarakis: first of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we were trying to accomplish the best deal in 2012, bypassing the sharp edges it existed.
We pushed forward the reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extreme circumstances.
The market had fallen and there was no potential buyers willing to pay the price, which satisfy the Greek government.
I was speaker of parliament at that time, I was able to reconcile the opinions of three parliamentary groups comprising then a government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, and it is in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations held outside.
And we were able to lead the country to a normal situation, which would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by early general elections, the result of December's presidential elections bottomless.
Euronews: last week on the territory of Greece is moving the massive flow of refugees.
What do you think about this situation and about the reaction of European countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Memarakis: the refugee crisis is a ticking time bomb, which we are going to have to deal with after winning the election.
And the reason is that the SYRIZA government has not acted in this situation as they should.
Such matters should act in a way forward, because if the problem catches up with you, only emergency measures remain.
And we are now exactly in this situation.
Even the interim government, replaced within seven days, has made more than SYRIZu than Mr. Tsipras has done in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which provides valuable assistance to the president of the republic, who called the EU summit, will find a solution to hold.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice - refugees are not illegal immigrants.
It is the victims of war in Syria, the victims of any extraordinary events that happened to them.
This question has a deeply humanitarian aspect, and we will stick to the position that European politicians should take in this new situation.
An appropriate decision must be made at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and refugee reception centres.
We also need to effectively use the economic aid that we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mr Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Memarakis: thank you.

Man who opened fire at Delta State University, left a note with apologies
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later in the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote the note, which states that he "regretted" about the first murder and would like to "all return back," the trustees reported on Tuesday.
Police in the town of Gotye, Mississippi, reported that a teacher of geography and social sciences at the University of Delta, called 911 at about 10 a.m. service.
Monday and reported that he had someone shot.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police need to send people to his home.
He said: "Last night I killed my wife," and also mentioned that the house has a "pösik," which "will not touch anybody," but probably upset.
The police asked the name calling, but he has not named him.
Lamb did not explain why he opened fire.
Having arrived at the scene, police discovered there body Amy Prentiss crime, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamba, 45, which said, "I'm sorry I would like to bring everything back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
Writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the University of Delta, which killed Itana Schmidt, a teacher of history, and on Monday night, when he was surrounded by police, committed suicide.
University rector William Laforges said he was not aware of any conflict between Lambom and Schmidt, but "Mr Lamba clearly had something on his mind."
Despite the information received on Monday about what had envisioned the novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, Lamb officials on Tuesday reported an "absence of any information or evidence" service "a love triangle."
About Prentiss was recalled as a "good man" Sean O'Steen, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but have remained friends.
O'Steen said that he and Prentiss' daughter, who is 19, and that she was "inconsolable.
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsey Noles, which the Herald Sun newspaper calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter was working at home via the internet.
Noles was told that Prentiss had the hunting dog named Laitning, and that she met with Lambom about three years.
She said: 'She always wanted to help people Knowles."
Police said on Monday that, at some point, phoned relatives to tell Lamb that "he wouldn't go to jail."
On the evening of the same day when police caught him on a highway "1" near Greenville, he stopped the car, jumped out of her Lamb, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university website, in the spring of 2015, he received a Ph.D. from the University of Delta Lamb in the field of pedagogy.
Stars who have lost their luck
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has gone through several difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his life-long companion, Farrah Fawcett, dead from cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug dependence, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All this, of course, played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United was out for several months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is experiencing on this occasion, because of which won't be able to go out on the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during a reckless sub-Hector Moreno in the 15th minute when sliding 20-year-old Shaw burst into the penalty area of PSV.
He was assisted on the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken away to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
It will be transported to Manchester tomorrow or later in the day, and then will be operated on.
It is awful - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, has overcome great difficulties and began to play fantastically, and then this happened.
There was oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it is for six months, and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he will be able to play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and a penalty was not scheduled.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish his Mexican.
Van Gaal believes that an Italian judge had made a mistake.
Judge for yourselves, when I say that it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ungood sub back with two legs.
In his Twitter message, Shaw writes: "Thank you everyone for your words, not to describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I'll be back even stronger than it was."
Still on the topic: Manchester United is experiencing misfortune with Luke Shaw in defeat in game with PSV
British defender will have an additional incentive to improve for the championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very heavy injury."
When any player gets out with a similar injury, everything is very upset by this.
It was never the intent of our players - to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Galya at World Championships 2014
"He is now very difficult because he had no intention of injure an opponent, and when you hear that it's a very heavy injury, then you feel unwell," Koka said.
I had no opportunity to see the moment itself.
The only thing I could see is the ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked as though he (Moreno) touched him, but I didn't see podkata under Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it's like, I know how difficult it is to move.
It is very hard for me, and I am very sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know about "Lorax" anything else?
Every parent very quickly absorbs the one thing: if your child likes a book, there will be a bit of time before you will know it almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you are David Cameron.
Answering a question about a representative of the company engaged in children's holiday vacation, his favorite childhood book organization, the prime minister chose "Lorax" - a fairy tale with an environmental twist, written by Dr. Susz in 1971.
It was a difficult choice," Cameron wrote in the comments, published on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "It's a hilarious, touching, unusual story with the strong message I love to read to their children, because it always reveals some image or message that we have omitted."
And everything would be fine, except the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to transfer the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the movie of the same name, filmed in 2012, speaks with new characters and details added to diversify a fairly short original narrative.
"In the city, surrounded by high walls, where there was no greenery and even useful Everythingville was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to conquer the air of Odri - the girl of his dreams, performing her heart desire - to see a real tree - "we read in the text a description of a love story, unknown Dr. Suzu (real name Theodore Seuss Geisel), who died in 1991.
If that seems insufficiently suspicious, Cameron's text reads almost like a summary of the film's plot, "Lorax" on the Internet Movie Database website: "In a place surrounded by high walls of the city, where everything was artificial and even useful Everythingville was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the air heart of Audrey - girls of their dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, though, admittedly, an active parent, not so familiar with the content of the book, in which an unnamed boy learns about how destroying the environment on behalf of the greedy felling of trees and an "all-right" viser ather, despite the protests of the Lorax ek (whose name Nakhodkins delivered in the title) is a funny creature with mustache, which "speaks on behalf of the trees."
Most likely, such a simple PR task was assigned to the performer, who had never read a book about Lorax 20 times in a row the child.
A spokesperson for Downing Street said that the text was allegedly received from Cameron's office in the constituency.
Company SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but there was no further comment.
For Adam Lita clearly there was a risk of not getting into England, but it's still a complicated issue again
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates - not an easy task, but if you look at the England team for this tour, a repeat of that defeat in a test series seized with a score of 3-0, what happened last time, does not seem likely to me.
I would also have not ruled out winning on the field.
Alister Cook's team may be less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but there are players who are among the players and virtuoso host Chers and collective thought strongly; these cool balls will not bear scars from 2012, but only a junior positive.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into the bowler and Adil Rashid screached ball, even if he is an unknown figure for Test level attack below option.
Still on the topic: Adam Leith was out of England's Test cricket team and replaced by Alex Hiles circle
The decision to exclude Adam Lita to me, his main coach in "Yorkshire," of course, is difficult to analyze.
In his seven Test matches have had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and obvious, but the brutal reality is that cricket players are assessed by judges according to results.
There were no questions about John Rutu, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I have said this before) the players best choose themselves.
A couple of half-long, and Lita could wait for more oten career, but he was in the grip of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more Rans for "Yorkshire," there will be another opportunity.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, had good cheer about his mood, even when he did not show what he is capable of, and it does not surprise me; first and foremost a team player, and then everything else.
The question, how much time will pass before the batsman of Test cricket will leave an impression of himself - a complicated issue.
Lit played in seven games, as well as Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton - in nine.
Compton only got the chance to play on his own and on another field.
The only thing on which you could complain is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League, when Lit was in the best form, but this lost opportunity is already in the past.
He appears, and Hayes batsman Scott, whom I appreciate highly.
He's an unpredictable cricket player, and what we have seen in the Yorkshire club earlier this season, when he earned 236 in the match against us at Trent Bridge, something that was already set.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who were before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
An idea to put Moeng near Kuok as an opening shift that would give an opportunity to introduce additional Batner, keeping four high-speed backchannels, considering, and I don't bow against it.
I see no reason why a player cannot hit the ball there, but this springing lefty has already shown that he is a fucking good cricket player.
Moen, perhaps not quite what was needed for his county Wustershire, but became the third number for them, and there is a big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches, "a third bethchange before opening out in 2001.
He won just three hundreds and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup spinner, and during my conversations with him it seemed to me a very long unpromising young man.
People can look at his approximate statistics - averaging 31 with bat and 35 with the ball - and to think that this is a risky bet, but among the spinners voting "for" a little bit, and who chose to take the youth.
He has a lot to learn from this tour.
In addition to the national team, England are planning to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching structure.
The appointment of Mahela Jayauswardine, shri-lankian bethchange, as a consultant for Test matches, could be the masterstroke.
He is one of the best guys for the game, which brings to it the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide energy, as well as a ruthless pace in retape.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's a game or a coaching job, and, like Mahela, has a considerable intelligence.
Sometimes the new voices in the locker room, even if they say something that has already been said before, can give new force to the team.
Kohli's colleague Ben Stokes left the team at Durham, Rutu provided a similar break for one in connection with the island along with some, and I'm not, for example, Australia about this problem.
Although not everyone will agree with this, coaches and individuals who select players do not determine the timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on results.
Such decisions should never be taken lightly.
Supporters of Britain's EU exit camp could win if the economy will be in recession by 2017
David Cameron's ill-considered policies on resuming negotiations to keep Britain in the EU every day are increasingly experiencing difficulties, even without looking at the election of a genius: "Is it yes or no?" - JeremCorbyn Labour leader or TUC resentment over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Korbine and Nigela Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained recently that when a situation in which the EU is currently experiencing a variety of crises, not all of them are of their own making - some member states fed up with British egocentric self-serving concessions and undermine the subpoena, which they disagreed mostly do not want to change.
Gathered in Brighton for the annual meeting, the TUC has decided that he doesn't want them anyway if they destroy social protection.
We could even call it a "program selfi Dave and George."
The prime minister and the finance minister are rolling around and bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, to photograph themselves sessions on the backdrop of a famous local monument, local celebrities or without it, then come home and tell companies that they attract allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants an interested in maintaining external contacts Britain under EU - "Don't leave us tent along with France," says Berlin - offers to say that ministers and officials in some capitals reached blinders by understanding when they would still remain, or we would leave.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is quite cautious, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave a cabinet before the situation gets worse for her, as she has deteriorated for the place of Thatcher (11 years) evruidered, Mitterrana (14) and Kolya (16).
French President Francois Hollande faces overflight or replacement in 2017.
He, too, is losing strength.
Poland may soon get a nationalist right-wing government, Spain is left.
Hard to see them growing out of the skin, to help "selfie-razam," whose energy could be spent on shavers exit of Scotland from the UK - which they also do not want to avoid, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan the issuance of deliberately useless remarches in the style of the SNP during the referendum campaign in the UK in 2017, to spur the process of Britain's exit from the EU, suggests my friend.
"Revisited" and "Britain has not received a proportion of an obsession from the resumed negotiations "nothing valuable.
Europeans, for their trouble, know what a predator may be Fleet Street and how skeptical, and in relation to the EU, media tycoons are in contrast to the days of Tony Beny in 1975, which supported the launch of our membership in a 1973 referendum ratio of 2: 1.
They can dimly remember Boris Johnson, who celebrated his Euro opportunist for an inveterate "straight bananas" of the EU, Brussels correspondent in the early nineties.
For all its stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies.
They included a colorful company of feared tax swindlers, phone hackers of outsiders and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was absolutely the same opinion about them, but was aware that when you are put in a cage with lush gorilla, you must give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was greater than Blair himself in opposition to Cameron's devotee about the referendum because Blair was acting normally in favor of the EU constitution that cancelled the principles of Blair recently buried French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a winning ticket.
The press had not forgiven him anything from this.
But milyga Jeremy Corbyn, who has friendly pat me on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he no longer has time to spend it on me - appears to be at risk of repeating the strategy of Nile Kinnock "boycotting Merdoku" from the 1980s - an error and then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of engagement with the press - not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the Air Force he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolutionment.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the trainealist tendency of UKIP and a broader range of "diocsupporters of small England" among the Tories could probably say on this "yes."
It is the same thing that Hilary- "Benn, but not the magnet" -Benn said on the radio and TV couple this week, while his inner Boy Scout struggled to admit that the appointment of Corbyn unrefused John McDonnell's "shadow" finance minister wore was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father fought hard on TV for wick disloyalty to colleagues in the Labor Cabinet, without going too far and not losing his post in the cabinet.
Hilary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay "under any circumstances" is the phrase that Benna is not what McDonnell said, nor does it pay for J. K. spoke to ram and members of parliament at a private meeting Monday evening, universal opinion.
Neither wanted to tell a Democrat and "his guy there," Korbin - remember, he touched even me - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24-hour TV seven days a week, and especially in the whirlpool of social networks, the hearth of paranoia and betrayal.
It is reasonable not to give Cameron so just to separate from Europe, allowing him to take for granted Labour support during the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell's and Corbyn's main misconception about EU membership - as part of the "Sunni" economy of besieged fortress - is no longer an enquestion of esoteric discussions among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism generated by insignificant difference is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his delusions about NATO - Tom Watson unyielding that J.C. would not be to agitate for an exit - foreign diplomats will be required to try to bring this to their leaders at home.
Why Paris or Berlin to spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on Britain's concessions, when it can all be pointless?
The US is already very disappointed with weak British military action in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the government of the Tories in power cuts back on spending than I was reminded on Monday during a lunch at a non-forum called British Influence Security.
Experts have criticized the review of e-cigarettes from Public Health England
The government-funded agency claims that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking, came at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, the researchers reported.
Experts, published in British Medical Journal (BMJ), who together with the Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic Cigaretthere.
PHE has published an important report - a "turning milestone" last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the authenticity of the data and pointed to the connection between some experts with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized "an extremely shaky argument," on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In a BMJ article, another two researchers asked whether these claims are "solid or poorly founded." under a sweet
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Cowell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Pei University, said: "The fundamental principle of health at Liverpool is the rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects the PHE claims that "the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are around 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco smoking" were based on detailed analysis of evidence and modeling.
In fact, it is derived from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model to multikritseries analysis of decision-making to sum up their opinions about the harm associated with various nicotine containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in the scientific publication axle.
Makki and Kpvell reported that one of the sponsors of meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which had previously reported that the Director General reported he had received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT certificates for health in the report on sustainable development.
One in 12 people at the meeting announced the funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, not mentioning about funding, which he reportedly previously received from tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the choice of board members was not granted, but among them there are several prominent supporters of e-cigarettes, some of which also announced funding for the industry publication.
It is not known whether other participants of the meeting have management experience in tobacco case.
The meeting also visited the head of tobacco fields in PHE.
The scientific article, published by the group, "agrees with the fact that there is a lack of "delicately "strong evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Keïvell.
However, none of these links and restrictions have not been affected by the PHE report.
Makki and Kaipvell told PHE statements that "at present there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers to smoking," are premature.
Dr Kevin Fenton, head of health and wellbeing at PHE, told the BMJ that the answers were previously given statements.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking."
One of the two who smoked all his life had died from his addiction.
All evidence implies that the health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to explore distant consequences.
PHE has had a clear duty to inform the public about what they show and what evidence does not prove, especially where there were doubts about the relative dangers of tobacco compared with the public.
About 80,000 people a year die from diseases related to smoking, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
It is clear that although e-cigarettes are safe and are not closely identified, they are only a fraction of the harm done by smoking - we carry out our tasks in front of the nation.
Former Channel 4 chief believes the BBC should stop the EastEnders episode
The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop producing programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would give much for such successful shows as soap opera about "Albert Square."
Johnson noted that licensing fees should be used only for the creation of such programs, which are not produced by other British TV and radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for the fact that the company puts the transfer of public broadcasting, which certainly looks only a small portion of the audience, at peak airtime when competitors are going to have a show with high approval ratings and channels such as BBC4.
After BBC director-general Tony Hall said the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson remarked that he had in his time for six years unsuccessfully tried to establish cooperation with the BBC while working for Channel 4.
"I can't get away from the idea that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcasts transfers that could show rival companies not receiving subsidies," Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of clarifying the future fate of the BBC.
If you save the license fee, which I do not consider a good solution in the medium and long term, the company should be left on the air only those programs that are not produced and not going to be produced by other companies.
Show The Voice broadcast in prime-slot because the creators want to get the maximum possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else doesn't show it, ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go on funding for programs that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is common knowledge that they are of their own production.
Other channels would undoubtedly have given much for it.
I don't understand how this could be a public broadcasting.
I don't think it would somehow minimize the BBC.
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed the channel Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC in pursuit of ratings "because of the ambitions of employees and because of their belief that this is the best way to win support for a long time."
His comments about the BBC's most popular shows resonate with comments by Sky executive director Tony Bolla, who in his memory of MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested the BBC sell serials such as EastEnders.
Johnson noted that the more niche transmission of BBC public character "continue to go on BBC4, where often you can't gauge the audience, but the function of the company performed, and this can be charged as an argument in sanctimonious sermons, justifying revenue from licensing fees to 4 billion pounds: "Well yeah, of course, we do all these obscure transfers that no one is looking."
They put them in the slot, where no one ever will be watching them.
Johnson told the committee about the license fee as follows: "I urge you to find a more regression system with regard to who most parents will receive from it.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year - a huge amount, but for people for whom £150 is big money, I wonder, they think so because they don't really watch and listen to the BBC.
The former executive director of channels Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of "informed, enlightened and party kai." i say.
He noted that only a small portion of the material produced by the BBC is now formally classified as educational - in his words, it is 1% of TV content and 0.1% on radio - and that the company should catch the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "informed, enlightened and party aikai." th.
On matters of partnership, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in such areas as "Promenadnye concerts" (only some of them, he says, is shown on TV), as well as to enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to manage your brain cells using sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction of movement at the moment when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have made worms with genetically modified nervous system, which can be controlled using ispulsa sound waves.
Tiny nematodes are changing the direction of movement at the moment when they affect sound impulses, too high, so that the human ear could hear them.
Impulses have effects by activating neurons, genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Still on the topic: researchers control brain activity using light
The scientists said that the worms demonstrate the possibility of a new method called "sonogenetics," the essence of which is the use of ultrasound for the initiation of certain brain cells, heart and muscle, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute, in La Jolla, Calif., told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which the person's brain to send electrical impulses and which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Chervi-nematodes do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles reinforce ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect structures called "ion channels TRP-4," discovered in membranes blocks of certain cells of worms.
Ultrasound waves are forcing these ion channels to open and tempt the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create a nematode that can be controlled via ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of worms, so their motor neurons used ion channel TRP-4.
While using ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves reinforced microscopic bubbles and were introduced to organisms worms, activating modified motor neurons.
This method is similar to that which is applied in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to enable or disable neurons using light pulses.
Chalasani argues that in comparison with this methodology sonogenetics may have some advantages.
In contrast to the light, which is delivered to the desired brain area by fiber optics, low frequency ultrasound waves freely pass through the body's tissues, so no need to go inside the skull in order to deliver them.
"We believe that in order to treat certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can at times make human neurons sensitive to ultrasonic signal," said Chalasani ковому.
He added that, in addition, the method can be applied to muscular and insulin-producing cells forming ru.

Eight golden rules of living in student dormitories
Already 11 years have passed since I moved into a student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old person who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but only now I recall strained smiles of those who I was irritated - and numerous, lengthy complaints on others.
Basically what I learned can be spread across eight simple rules.
Moving into a hostel can range from slightly acting on nerves to absolutely terrifying.
He encourages chat: telling people where you are, whether you're an academic holiday and where it had held, do you support Corbyn and why do you "honestly neither love nor hate" Marmayt, "because, seriously, guys, it's just yeast extract HAHAHA, I'll have myself."
Peredochny.
And help others to rest too - ask questions and demonstrate fresh interest.
It supports conversation and helps you find people that you like, rather than those with whom you wouldn't even talk, even if you have eyelashes, they would have handed out alight and fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
Rooms of people often turn into drinking establishments, semi-night cinemas and places of common people, but they are also the place where people go and dress up and improve their underwear.
Still on the topic: don't even think to begin studies at university, being in a relationship
There are unfair to introveron universities.
Your room should be a haven, but many hostels are shaping the culture from one room to another, which promotes friendship, rickety of communication and leads to a long friendship.
It could be hell for someone who is trying to regain power.
Nothing in culture allows you to say: "You don't like me, and I want to keep up with you, but I need you to leave friends and I was able to restore the power that I spent to communicate with you."
Try to feel when a co-worker is tired of communicating and not to knock students to him, but to send an SMS.
By the way, about the tie: do it.
One guy in my dormitory followed this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
And make friends with the help of baking.
Because you start university life at the height of the popularity of the Bake-Off show, then knocking on the door to people to introduce yourself and highlight the plate of chocolate biscuits, is no longer such a strange action, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we are neighbours, I give you something baked and now smile, explore and I will ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to chat with you and that, in the end, probably your face will be associated with their pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on whether you're a good baker.
Bad tear lumps of flour, sugar and fat is more likely to cause captive people to pretend to be asleep when you'll knock them off.
Stealing food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, assigning someone's chicken is theft, but is it theft - take a bit of milk for tea?
Inquire the owner of milk.
Most likely he will offer you not to be shy, even if inside boiling with anger.
If someone is stealing your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize - but you try to take it older than my neighbor, who poured into his milk fluid for washing dishes to avenge those who took it without asking.
She is now in prison.
You don't need to produce noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the very people from saying about glass houses.
A girl in my hallway asked a neighbor to kill the sound of drums and bass guitar, as was a3 o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam this morning.
In response, a neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally fell silent at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours and then cut her music and locked her door behind him, having gone on a three-hour exam.
It was not romantic, if your future spouse had settled in the same dormitory as you?
Instead, it would not be very much, until a piece of elbows, awkward, if you took the neighbor for his future wife, was fascinated by him, broke relations and would see him every day, and perhaps watch as he moves his side up on all your mutual friends turning?
Of course, you cannot dictate your heart - but if a hot neighbour is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool its own fervor slightly.
In that thrilling moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside their locked room, the line between drawing and travley thinner than it seems.
A good draw - it's fun, but turns into its opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting lesson on security, hiding something - say but never pack anything toothpaste and shampoo room chkaho.
Lock the door and drop the keys in someone else's glass of water, which you will then put in freezer - but do not adhere to other things glue Tack waj ceiling more than two Blu-times.
9: how to install a new operating system on the iPhone after the release of the firmware update from Apple
The new operating system can be requested by logging into the app settings, select General and then "Software Update."
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have faced problems after installing when you receive an error message saying that they failed to "update applications."
To avoid this, users are encouraged to either wait until they've revived or try to upgrade via iTunes.
Hints on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process until the end.
The process may include removing applications for an increase in free space - but Apple has minimised the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and also has simplified the execution with a special utility that proposes to remove the app and re-install them again after completing the process.
We should make sure that when upgrading your phone is charged or located near the charger to prevent battery discharge.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop updating because the phone discharging in the process can cause crash updates.

Washington responded with a telephone call to Russian military activity.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry phoned his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, military support, which Moscow has provided to President Assad, only leads to an escalation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House so far is not going to talk about this with the Russian counterpart, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry telephoned Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This edition of PJ Media reports.
"Secretary Kerry made clear that President Assad's continued support from Russia poses a risk of exacerbation and prolongation of the conflict, as well as having a negative impact on our shared goal of combating extremism - if we do not continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict, also by the immediate transfer of power," US State Department officials said.
They also noted that Kerry once again underscored the U.S. commitment to the fight against "Islamic State" as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be a member of it.
In addition, the US "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in trying to confront the Islamic State.""
Last Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what actions taken by Russian troops in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, White House spokesman Josh Ernest said that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet occurred: "When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he would lift the phone and try to make this call."
Barack Obama himself believes Russia's decision to increase support for Assad's regime "a losing rate."
I remember our conversation with Mr Putin, four or five years ago, when I told him that this is a mistake that further support for Assad would only worsen the situation.
"But he didn't listen to my warnings - and as a result, the situation worsened," the US president said.
Imported yachts are freed from paying customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sport from paying customs duties and taxes.
Corresponding changes in the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
About this "Izvestia" said Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Lashkin.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev following a trip to Crimea commissioned a number of agencies -- the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Foreign Ministry, EMERCOM, FSB transport, FCS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals for creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts point out that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, maintenance and content of the yachts.
The owners prefer to keep their ships overseas - approximately €200 million annually goes to the treasury of European states for maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
Russia's Ministry of Economic Development has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On Amendments to List of Goods, temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from paying customs duties, taxes, "involving the provision of full conditional exemption from paying customs duties, taxes in relation to imported yachts and other floating funds for recreation and sport.
According to the ministry, it will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country," Lashkin said.
This issue has been tabled for consideration by the subcommittee on customs, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade financing cost of a Government Commission on economic development and integration, which the meeting took place in September, and was also approved by authorities following the results of the discussion.
As a spokesperson for the Ministry of Economic Development has noted, the proposed measure on full conditional release at import is inherently benefit.
Therefore, after the approval of the protocol of the government commission meeting in the Russian Federation Ministry of Economic Development will make an offer for the Eurasian Economic Commission discussion with states - members of ENPP, explained Lashkin.
In the list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to assist foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for application in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism to provide international aid and others - service equipment (personal computers, among them typewriters), control and measuring instruments, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skiing, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and items for religious ceremonies.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of Russian Federation told Izvestia that prepared mandatory regulations" on sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provide a simplified procedure for processing the setting and exit small-size, sports sailing and pleasure boats at sea port.
The Ministry of Transport are given orders to provide capital of maritime ports of Crimea using simplified approach for small-size, sports sailing and pleasure boats at sea port and release of these ships from the sea port.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared draft regulations of the Russian government on approving the borders of Crimea port area.
In respect of Yalta and Feodosia orders have already been taken, the rest are in the process of reconciliation," said the press service of the department.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state surveillance, classification and examination, state registration in respect of small-sized vessels used for non-commercial purposes must carry out the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that it is extremely difficult to yachting in Russia due to poor infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, then there is an ever-evolving industry, in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, virtually all stands on the same spot.
Our coastline uninteresting, the only piece where it is possible to operate a yacht year-round is the Black Sea near Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk and Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that this area is extremely strict rules of border service: in order to get a walk on a yacht, you need to make a lot of permits.
Besides, inside Russia, a yacht where not even a pit-stop.
For two days, she can go with his fuel, and then the problem arises where his take," says Nordmarine sales director Denis Novikov.
As far as storage places, the yachts in Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special hangars for yachts up to 30 metres, and also yachts are sent for storage in Turkey, Finland, Sweden, Germany.
Novikov said that the buyers of the yachts are rich people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts has declined.
The World Bank gave Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million to develop the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The new funding will support a series of priority measures for reform in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the report said.
The World Bank Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Qimiao Fuan said that reform of the banking sector would help to revive lending in the real economy and stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and at the World Bank are watching the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the severity of the problems Fuan calls on Ukraine's government to accelerate reforms.
Earlier the Polish government had approved a loan of €100 million to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reported. ""
Prisons are asked to create separate units for transgender people.
At the Public Council at the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) to protect the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues will discuss the possibility of creating in colonies separate blocks for transgender and transvestites.
About this "Izvestia." said a member of the board of Vladislav Grib
In his opinion, depending on the total number of prisoners in Russia undecided on the floor, domestic prisons may include individual cameras, blocks or even (if there will be many such criminals) in perspective to create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that determining the punishment of citizens in such an isolated place of departure is possible only after the convicts will go through the appropriate medical expertise, which prove that the perpetrator is truly a man who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite gender.
Vladislav Grib believes that the isolation of transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of serving sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice successfully operates abroad: in a pre-trial detention centre (where the accused are before the court's decision) provided separate cameras for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special units.
Today it is the only way out when dealing with such criminals.
Clearly we need to isolate them, because the presence of transvestites and transgender people in normal cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN employees.
Humiliations are guaranteed by cellmates," says Vladislav trs Grib.
Depending on how big a city, how many criminals with uncertain floor, you need and count where they are distributed.
Detention centers are not needed precisely - only cameras, separate blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if transgender people will be a lot.
As Grib explained, in the block may contain 50 or 100 people, and if the specialized corps will be created in Russia alone, then the punishment for transgender prisoners can come there from all regions of departure.
Citizens are kept in pre-trial detention at the place of the crime, so the receipt of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects in the course of the investigation and judicial process are unrealistic, but to introduce such practices for prisoners already in a separate colony - yes," says Grib.
It should be reminded that before law enforcement officers were unable to decide in which the detention facility - male or female - to determine the detainee for drug possession of 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kozukova (known as Alina Davis), because of what a man with a maiden appearance was not arrested.
He was released home under a subscription of non-departure.
This news was widely discussed on social networks and in the media, because the mechanism for transgender people in detention and prison colonies Rosie really does not exist yet.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolay Alexeyev supported the idea of creating special places to serve a sentence for transgender people, noting that overseas it is also possible to define - male or female - depending on their own desire of the colony.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as well as the issue of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals," says Alexeyev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be done in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially as they are in prisons more than transgender people.
At the same time, Alexeev doubts that Russia will find itself a lot of citizens who are willing to give themselves over to transexual people in order to get into an excellent council from ordinary colony.
Of course, you can enter a medical examination before placing people in the colony for transgender people, but everything is not always clear.
For example, in the US, one of the prisoners, Chelsea Menning looked like a man and was already in jail, said he wanted to change the floor, Alexeyev said.
A person can feel anyone.
But while some places to serve penalties for transgender people, I have no doubt that prison staff will be thinking seriously about the safety of such people and empathize with their orientation or gender identification details.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health on the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transgender offenders in the colony could severely delay the early departure of al-punishment convicts.
The commission is created - it is a matter of sexology, psychiatrists hold lengthy observations, this is not a single test, which is done on the basis of high-precision conclusion.
Today's opportunities for psychiatry allow this.
Therefore, and before the change of gender, potential patients undergo always such expertise - they show exactly whether a change of gender with surgical intervention is a necessary measure," said Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how this system is implemented in relation to the condemned, because on average for such examination takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals, also doubts that support in the current economic conditions will be appropriate to allocate funds for construction of new premises, medical expertise, transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there is no official statistics, but given that gay people in Russia are around 5%, it is possible to say that transgender people even less, and those who have such a deviation and commit crimes, and even small numbers," said Lordkipanidze altogether.
Now, at the request of the administration of the colony of homosexuals, transgender and so before can obtain separate conditions.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk ended World Chess Championship among juniors up to 20 years.
Ending the championship was given more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and he became a Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to overtake Yanna-Kdid Pole Dudu, who seemingly confidently went to zysztof title.
Ukrainian chess player Natalie was celebrating winning the girls' letters.
World Chess Championship, held from the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already by mid-tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all intriguing, because Poland's representative Jan Krzysztof Duda, issued a series of four victories (competitions are held under the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently took over leadership.
Given that Duda has been rating primacy, and generally -favorite is considered one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he will miss being produced in a very small gap appeared.
And even when Duda made momentum and allowed Russians Mikhail Antisbapov to cut in just 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favorite of the gap in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov, to catch up with the leader, was sure to win in the 13th round of the need.
But even that would not help win a Duda his party.
Plus, of course, this obligation of victory could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait, when his party will complete Duda, who met with Benjamin Book.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player swel confrontation with Dutch draw.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13, but the Antipov had the best possible additional indicators.
Therefore, it was his leadership of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, the governor of which Natalia Komarova, traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, has given the main prize.

In the current year, a study by the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian managers" leaves the 16th time.
Being a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian managers of the top echelon, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers for a year, revealing the leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates is made up of the winners of last year's ranking.
Last year's winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate in this year's ranking and put members of his management team.
In addition to each of the candidates included in the initial list, offers from other companies that would offer ten new managers would be appropriate to add to the overall pool of candidates.
Perhaps the next managers of functional areas, setting up a company, Chief Financial Officer, Commercial Director, Director of Marketing, HR Director, IT Director, Public and Corporate Affairs Director, Corporate Governance Director, director of relations with authorities.
Each proposed manager is sent an invitation to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate experts of their management team and up to ten new executives from other companies.
The nomination of candidates for sectoral principle is carried out on the basis of industry classifier of Association of managers: information technology, commercial banks, forest and timber industries, engineering, media, metallurgy, multi-core holdings carried, professional services, communications and telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, finance, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel industry.

"The best choose the best" approach is based on the methodology of building a rating: top managers assess top managers, functional managers assess functional managers.
This principle makes it possible to obtain the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at meetings of expert committees.
Everyone is invited to meetings of this year's ranking as expert committees and multiple candidate candidates rating from previous years.
Commissions are arranged on functional grounds: the Commission approves the list of top managers and eight commissions on approval of leaders of functional areas.
At meetings of expert committees are invited to approve presented lists in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly according to Internet assessment and classified information before publication rating) or make actualizing their adjustments according to the attached file list of reserve candidates.
The names of companies are given in accordance with the rules of Russian language and norms "quality."
At the time of publication of the rating, there may be changes in the status of managers and companies.
The comfortable rate for the investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market for lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-April this year was asking for 40%.
What do you estimate the situation today?
Panic after the end of 2014 and early 2015, SME lending volumes have declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp rise in interest rates.
Lending under 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
If previously the bank could lay in an increased rate of all its possible problems in the future, it is impossible to make the overdue payments to non-returns: bets and so sky-high.
For business, the current level of rates on SME loans is not comfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.
The level of rates in 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns on them.
How do you estimate the demand for business loans is satisfied?
The situation has improved slightly after the Central Bank lowering interest rates.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to ask for loans much less frequently.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects of its development and future revenues.
Today, businesses have one way out: we need to learn how to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
We need to monitor the current results more closely, to control the movement of cash.
At the same time, if they have the financial resources to use new technologies that allow us to modernize equipment, reduce costs and energy supply costs.
All this ultimately allows the company to make products more competitive and keep businesses even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the key market trends and will affect the development of its SME lending would be strengthened by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for lower average rates will largely depend on the central bank's policies, and now the regulator shows the sequence in question of lowering the key rate.
However, the radical drop in loan prices for SMEs should not wait.
In the current situation, the problem is, first of all, inflation, which makes the necessary increased interest rates to obtain real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even when the Central Bank lowering rates.
Speaking about the level of delay, the company has traditionally been limited to small and medium-sized businesses, as well as opportunities to replenish funds and options for correction of economic behavior, certainly will pose a greater risk to lenders.
I would not expect a substantial reduction in the proportion of bad loans.
The main reason is the international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.

Kiev has torn the atomic unia.
Kiev has officially formed Ukraine's refusal to cooperate with Russia on enlargements of Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday with the second attempt still voted for the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the third and fourth blocks enlargements were signed back in 2010-2012, but the project failed to start.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law that terminated the agreement with Russia in 2010-2012 concluded about the construction of the third and fourth blocks in Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant.
A bill introduced by the government to hold a second vote, for the first time, it could only support 210 deputies when required minimum in 226, but then opted for 234 members of parliament when the project overolohandling.
Built under the USSR Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant on the original project was to count four units under 1 GW with VVER type reactors, but had managed to build only two.
Negotiations with Moscow on enlargements resulted in 2010 to conclude an intergovernmental agreement, in 2011-2012, parliament passed the relevant laws.
Because there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that building blocks would have to credit the Russian side, but funds have not been allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the ensuing cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to expand relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry by announcing the refusal to cooperate in Khmelnytsky nuclear plant and construction project at Ukraine's nuclear fuel plant.
The only sphere where relations remained in Russia remained purchases of fuel for the country's existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of electricity generation), because as long as Ukrainian NAEC "Energoatom" to replace Russian supplies of nothing.
From plans in Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant with another contractor in completing Ukraine refused: even in 2014 in Kiev have not yet declared about negotiations with Czech Skoda JS.

He also urged to carry out the accord and "return to the normal life of mine of our countries."
On the question of whether it is possible, in his opinion, at present the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at a parliamentary level - in "normal" format or in the contact group's format andOSCE PA site - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there are minic agreements.
At the same time, according to the policy, in Kiev supports any kind of dialogue.

Parties were separate mandates.
Yesterday, the Electoral Commission of Nizhny Novgorod announced the results of the election to the city Duma on municipal district, having distributed 12 seats, cast of grant from party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the election came from representatives of the Communist Party, who were accused of "covering up" fraud in Electoral threat.
Opposition's remarks were not taken.
At the same time the party rejected Russia's "Communists" in organizing the election a referendum on the abolition of fees for capremont apartment buildings.
A city election officially presented the results of the Duma elections in Nizhny Novgorod on municipal electoral district.
Only 1.03 million people were included in the lists of voters in Nizhni Novgorod, ballot papers were issued and 746.7 thousand in precinct committee voted 268 thousand voters in elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were deemed invalid, and 24 were lost.
Yesterday 12 mandates were distributed among political parties depending on the votes they received.
"United Russia" lists for six seats in the Duma, Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnovrely, Vasiliy Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagoru.
LDPR party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky received a single mandate.
Two CPRF mandate are divided between Vladimir Bulanov and Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
"Just Russia" three mandates are given to Alexander Razumovskiy, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugina.
Now, these candidates must decide within five days whether they will work in a city Duma deputies: in case of refusal from the mandate he moves on to the next candidate on party list.
Alexander Makeyev, chairman of the election committee told the commission members that introduces hot standby for "send telegrams to Zhirinovskiy and others" subject to rejection of mandates.
While approving the protocol on the results of elections, representatives of the KPRF claimed multiple violations.
A member of the election committee with the right of deliberative voice from KPRF city Leonid Krasnokutsky suggested not to recognize the results of voting in four districts # 21-24, pointing out that the administration was closed on the orders of the head of the Sormovsky district administration, the entrance to the building where the four county commissions were located.
Inside we could not pass any deputies Gos for a long time, neither the candidates nor the observers, but specific resonance was shown on TV to storm the doors of the district administration scandal.
At meetings of all observers and members of the commissions were able to attend commissions with the right of deliberative vote.
They stopped access only when the voting ended and did not yet head of the precinct commissions to take their ballots come.
It was done with the aim of preventing different provocations.
"Then the head recovered and could be present at all meetings of the parties concerned," a member of the mountains of electoral commission Natalia Andrushina parried.
The Communists argued that in a blocked administration building more than four hours were illegally detained by Ludmila Aristov, deputy of the assembly area, about which the sack in the investigative committee sent a statement.
The opposition also resented that in some UICs on election day began sealing ballot in 6-7 hours in the morning, working out their ballots for early voting share.
At the same time, members of the commission with the right of deliberative voice and observers nobody warned, so they came to the beginning of election at 8 a.m. already.
Communists are sure that in the morning hours before the opening of polling stations in urns could arbitrarily cast ballots.
However, the mountains have already examined more than 124 complaints on different reelection committee, according to Alexander Makeeva, any violations with occasions non-accounted ballots have not found the rumors.
Did not support the commission members and offer his colleagues from "Just Russia" Maria Popova through regional legislation to clearly set out time with amendments of regional Electoral opening envelopes, which then fall into the urn voting ballot.
"In order of their own initiative, although the CEC is advised, please contact Ms. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting with loud accusations struck a member of the Communist Party chairman Sergei Samokhin, crying that the Electoral ignores dozens of complaints and covers the falsification of the election.
"You are not here at your rally, careful!" - the chairman of the state electoral commission offended.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
Until 27 September election committee will have to approve general election results, which will be appointed within three weeks after the first meeting of the city council of Nizhny Novgorod sixth convocation.
In addition to determining the outcome of elections, the city election commission denied a political party "Communists of Russia" in the registration of the initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the party people gathered to take two questions: whether they agree with the Nizhny Novgorod residents debate that charges should "immediately cancel" the major overhaul of apartment buildings, and tariffs for housing and communal services "freeze until 2020."
However, lawyer Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of "Duma Communists" contradicts Russian law.
FedEx revenue is mixed, lower forecasts for 2016
FedEx has reported on the results of the last quarter, and giant service delivery damworking reduced its annual profit forecast due to falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it planned to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that they'd hire 50,000 temporary employees for the holidays.
Its shares were cheap at about 2.5 per cent on preliminary bidding for 45 minutes before the exchange opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it planned to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends next May, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The lower forecast is seen despite rising rates by an average of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on January 4, and increase fees for ground transportation of heavy or overall cargo, which begins in November.
The company said they still plan to increase revenues compared to last year thanks to spending cuts, increased gross income and the growth of online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "has worked steadily, taking into account the weak, compared with the forecast, economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
Hiring plans for the holidays were announced the day after the rival workforce, UPS, claims that they plan to hire an additional 95 000 employees, roughly as much as took the job last year.
For the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than the year before.
Earnings per share stood at $2.42, close to the forecast average of $2.44 per share, conducted by Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed, Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from the downturn in the sector of urgent international transportation, which has led to a lack of growth in gross revenue in its express shipping division.
However, the boom in online shopping has dramatically improved the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from ground transportation grew by 29 per cent, but operating income remained generally unchanged due to increased costs for large departures and self-insurance.
Express transportation division received higher revenue because of higher benchmark rates, while the freight sector revenue fell due to rising labor costs.
In preliminary trading about an hour before the opening of the stock exchange FedEx fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 per cent for the year and 17 per cent below the record from June 11.
The most anticipated meeting of Federal Reserve officials for several years will spend two days at this week's 27 feet from the Honduran mahogany table, deciding whether it was time to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of the richly decorated room for meetings high in two floors above them will be the United States" wall image overhanging out.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues need to put the country's economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank received a dual mandate from Congress: to maximize employment and keep prices stable here in the US.
But since the Great Recession, the Federal System executives have acknowledged that there is a third, unmentioned assignment: financial stability apis.
And this third assignment may prove to be an unknown factor in the near-predicted decision, which will be announced on Thursday, with about whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecendent stimulus provided almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show strong growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may keep the Federal system's already cautious managers from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even just over a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself triggers financial market fluctuations.
Roughly half of the economists recently polled by Bloomberg had forecast rising interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect that the Fed will hold off, while a key indicator shows only about a 30-percent chance of rapid rise.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the Fed raises rates, assuming that those who make decisions do not soften the blow of a promise that the next increase will be non-core.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rise was driven by expectations that the faces that define the strategy of the Federal system will leave a bet this week," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"There will be a surprise if the Fed will raise rates at this point in time," he said.
If the Federal Reserve's guidance goes so, "they will have to go far in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so that they are not panforged."
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would act.
Only a month ago, the Fed appears to have tended to raise rates by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in slow tightened financial conditions that could women confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen claimed in the spring and early summer that she expects to raise rates this year, despite complaints from liberals about what greater economic progress is needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs in August slowed, labor market growth has been steady this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, which is the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost to the level at which the Federal system considers full employment.
Wage growth shows signs of accelerating.
And, while inflation continues to be below the target annual rate of 2%, the central bank said that the key reason was the temporary effect of a sharp Federal leadership system of falling oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the shrinking labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world became a shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 16% relative to a record high in May, value companies, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy could slow global growth.
The market partly regained its position this month, and the Dow is now about 10% below the high May values.
For the Federal Reserve's guidance the market outrage further complicates the difficult calculations of the term of raising interest rates.
"In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks they would have started tightening the screws at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve employee.
Now, he predicted, they will have to wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
"There is a big uncertainty in what might be the consequences for the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data after recent events in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not included in the main concerns of the Federal system, and technically it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.
But essentially the Federal Reserve has become a world financial power.
The Central Bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
One only hint from then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "stifle" its monetary expansion, sparked market turmoil around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined with each other, one might expect that Federal Reserve officials will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and with experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "art rather than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet, Inc - a company which deals with global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said earlier this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve, there were cases of over-reaction on financial market movements, which does not seem to be related to economic principles."
Lacker, a member of the powerful Federal Open Market Committee with the right to vote on raising rates as an example, who pressed 1998-99 led solutions.
The financial crisis in Asia has led to the fact that the Fed has reduced its benchmark rate by 0.75 per cent over three sessions, "despite limited identifiable consequences for growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, the heads of the Federal system abolished these declines.
The Federal Reserve should put on top concern about stability only in times of major crises, such as how the market crash in 2008," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the committee for setting interest rates at the Bank of England.
The latest panic and close did not come close to that level, he said.
"You would, of course, don't want to end up in a situation where you fear rising rates because markets are experiencing shock," said Pozen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and, as long as this does not change, I do not think that they should be ahead of the event.

"surely someone assumed and knew that the flows of refugees because of the poor and destitute people who are saved from death, will be turned into prosperous EU countries," he added.

Putin called on the international community to join forces with Assad to fight against the "Islamic State."
Commenting on the West's persistent claims that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if it goes away - at the request of the people, not by the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva conference or the Geneva communiqué.
"If the people want him to remain - the president remains, but otherwise he should depart immediately," he said.

As for the other states, then we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We don't see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist coalition and anti-igilovo US-led "said Assad.

We would like to remind you that autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, Mongolia and will last until September 18.
Ponaslawait a couple of days was a victory.
World athletics champion Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumphant one for 24-year-old light-athlete from Barnaul Sergey ShUBENKOVA.
He managed to win at his coronation distance 110 metres hurdles at the team championship of Europe, set a few records, and the main thing is to become a world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic Barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete won the final stage of "Brilliantova League recently," occupying the third place in the general standings.
"The new Izvestia asked Shubenkov to share impressions from the outgoing season.
Sergey, season for you is not finished yet?
Yes, I am going to speak at the World Military Games, which will take place October in Korea, and then I will think about the rest.
It is true that I will be prepared at home, in Barnaul, and now at home - it is still quite another condition.
Everything is easier than every week to motor around the world.
You once said that autumn is a favorite time of the year for you.
The end of August, beginning of September is a great time.
After the main start of the season, passions were not given away; burden of responsibility is already halfway up
We can compete in the pleasure, on "relax."
Plus you know what and leave very soon...
But fatigue is?
Still the season special, lots of positive emotions...
Fatigue towards the end of the season always accumulates.
And then it doesn't matter that I did more - won or lost.
Every competition is stress.
Frequent flights, overriding - all this does not pass for the body without trace.
Tired physically and emotionally.
But now the emotions I have, of course, is on the rise.
I'm just happy there - yes!
By the time the World Cup was finished in Beijing, return often?
It happens.
Oh, and you journalists, don't give me to forget about it.
But in general I think that bad sportsman who lives the old victories, scrolls their successful races over and over again.
Ponaslai was waiting a couple of days to win - we've got to move on.
Preparing for this remarkable season was very different from the usual?
I can't say that there was something special.
We started preparing as early as December, but winter competitive season I missed.
Trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the training camp, then again at home.
All as usual.
But with the coach set a task: to try to reach a new level on which I have not yet been.
Almost all winter spent to lay the base.
They ran a lot of cross races, having been doing exercises on commonnaysic preparation, which included both traction and effed, and the back we've shook lowered.
Then he went for barrier training, did a lot of technique.
For how are rivals, monitored?
I always try to do that, good in the Internet age with this there is no problem.
They looked at the winter European Championship and all the pedestal was taken over by the French Barrier Sprint!
Thought another: you need to do something, to dilute this company.
With every start this season you have added and added second in the results.
It gave confidence?
I have all the latest seasons fold on roughly the same scheme.
There is no such thing that I run first 13.20 and then - 13.50.
I always unwinding its shape gradually.
The main thing that we wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
The whole work was aimed primarily at this result.
But the paradox is that the kind of feeling that is ready for feats, and to show their readiness does not always get the competition.
As it was, for example, at the London Olympics?
I am, to be honest, the semi-final race (Shubenkov could not qualify for the final. "NI") tried to forget at once.
He was very good, really could run out of Ready's 13 seconds.
Yes, even if repeated his best result at that moment would be the bronze winner of the Games.
But unlucky.
Their first World Cup remember?
And how?
In Taigu it was.
I really wanted to climb into the final, then there was such a maximum plan.
And then came straight from the preliminary races and recutalach.
And then I realized that to tear and break his head would have nowhere to flee at all ascend.
Two years later, at the World Championships in Moscow, having already reached the final with the best time.
Well I remember my feelings before the decisive races: very much wanted to win "gold" already!
How can a decent speed, and not lose another head without building shut down?
But this is the most difficult.
You need to be very careful, focused on technique, not to knock down barriers.
I noticed that when you set yourself up, not the result, but the process is so much easier.
But you have the most buzz when you get the feeling that you run and everything looks like itself!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depths after the first serious success tend to move closer to the capital.
Never had such thoughts?
Houses are still better.
And I have no idea where I am without my trainer, who needs?
Maybe it would be good to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
C Klevtsov you've been together?
With 12 years since the athletics came to light.
More precisely, at first I was training at his wife, who worked with the children, and then she gave me.
I started with sprint, then jumped, triple in length.
It was when the ball was throwing their baby all-around in length from place jump...
At 14 I tried running with barriers and I liked that.
From the very first race managed to execute the second adult discharge rule.
And so remained.
Fear of the barriers was never?
Somehow managed to agree with them immediately.
But over the technology have always had to work very much.
Won over one overclocking how much was suffering!
But from this routine is nowhere to run.
I could always need honing technique - to wake up at night, I'd just stood up and ran through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing, argued that it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I also liked myself.
Normally I don't revise my races here, but could not help.
But we need to work further on efficiency - no limits of perfection.
Not afraid now that the victory of the year before the Olympics will fall on the shoulders of heavy load?
As they say in such cases, I would try to justify expectations.
Once chose this road, then must go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you're not weak, no additional cargo should not feel ac.
And I absolutely agree with him in this.
Otar Kusanashvilli
Well I'm not so naive to me, in amazement, the reaction to what happened in Ukraine has an interview.
People are, I understand, their bread doesn't feed others - give, will throw the enemy.
And though the flag, I did not, and the same was exactly the same, wrapped a million times before, and there is no one else called me directly cudk offence.
All my pseudo-ruzja in a moment, in a second somewhere evaporated.
I am so strong that even the pressure that I see being a guy, I think that people who are kind of white got declared.
As if walking on yourself, you were attacked, and the crowd went well and mutate rods known.
But I need to know me, I am not room eagle, I fist, I am from howitzers, old guys, wDaru fear.
It is another matter - no support.
I had no illusions, and so now...
The best in me has always been self-sufficiency, so that will bite out.
And giving away passports like Fred Durst or Monson in childbirth can only the Dukes.
I would work better, better journalist, non-shameful abuse.
A week ago in Kiev Otar Kushanashvili described the Crimean events in sharp form:
The fact that the crime was committed with the Crimean peninsula.
It is this and called the annexation.
I believe that the reference to how drunk Khrushchev tried to sign something which, in no event does not fit into the overall picture of human hostel.
This is how to come up with a neighbor and take his housing space...
The war has gone from the Kremlin, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% certain that, as in summer 2008, she began to call a cunt from the Kremlin's puppy.
I have assumptions of who it could be...
Kobzone is not so much left to live.
I don't understand that he is the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
He said that the apartment would lose?
Well, if he won the monument.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting his small homeland as great.
But reconciliation now only from Vladimir Vladimirovich depends.

But his answers to the question "If not you, then who should get to Wood's final rose?" they could unwittingly suggest who they actually won the heart of "Holostak."
Jevons-Fellows and Markoski did not doubting called McKay an ideal mate for Wood.
Between Sarah and Sam have established a good relationship since the first day.
"From that moment, as I entered the number of participants, I felt the energy (Sarah) and Sam's energy and understood that they were very suited to each other, and throughout the show never doubted that," said Jevons-Fellows.

There were several options from Jarrid Hayat to NFL career start.
Detroit and Seattle strongly interested in him after his move to the US - as well as a host of other clubs who have sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hain chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and, it seems, it was a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hayat on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former reserve player of the Australian rugby league admitted on the first return Pant in winning the game with a score from 20-3 with Миннес.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave him another opportunity to return the Pant, as well as Hain in his game after Reggie Bush's injury was involved.
Tomsula showed himself with a good hand and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of having the newcomers in the presence of the team, he will hold a different body. reassured them
Tomsula also publicly backed Hayat at a press conference after the match.
A special club's 49ers reporter Cam Inman reported that Hain also received support from the special teams coordinator Thomas McGoya, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hain lost the ball to return Pant's "Minnesota Vikings" team during the first quarter
At this start of his debut in the NHL Hain and numerous Australian fans clearly didn't count.
It was evident as Hain curses, walking away from the field after losing the ball, and later he told the leading "Hamish and Andy" show on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which could not imagine a more unfortunate start to a career in the NFL.
"This happens, you just think about the next game and everything," Hain said.
Hain likened his misses with a series of games debut in 2007, when the throw of the ball in his Origin zone brought Queensland try off-set.
Ultimately the experience proved to be quite useful for the 27-year-old player.
Hain was photographed with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted this picture on Instagram.

There have been clashes between migrants and police on the border of Hungary.
Refugees staged protests at the border of Serbia near the Hungarian village of Reske, which escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
As a result, Hungarian police had used water jets and tear gas, Reuters reports.
Migrants set up police with stones and try to demolish the slid border fence.
Reinforcements are sent to the place of clashes with police taking action in response to aggressive actions by migrants and their attempts to disrupt the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, refugees have managed to break through a police cordon, after which dozens of migrants ran into the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serb-Hungarian border on buses toward Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports the BBC."
The authorities allowed the migrants to arrive at Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers injured.
On September 15, Hungary's parliament toughened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the involvement of the army in safeguarding national frontiers, criminal prosecution of those who illegally crosses the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for examining asylum requests.
A Hungarian court has already admitted one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, in connection with what he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary for one year.
Also the Hungarian parliament soon intends to consider the transfer of Hungary's armed forces to protect the country's borders parliament functions.

Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk of Russia's support for Bashar Assad's regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry has warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Assad is exacerbating the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry made clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal to combat extremism, if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power," it said in a message published on the State Department website.
Kerry reiterated the U.S. commitment to combat the group "Islamic State" (whose activities are banned by Russia's Supreme Court) as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
According to the secretary of state, Assad "can never be a reliable member of the coalition."
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can be resolved only through a political transition from Assad.
The White House threatened Russia's isolation because of the support of Assad's regime.
On the eve of White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest threatened Russia's isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
Alternatively, Ernest offered to join the international coalition, which carries out anti-terrorist operation against the "Islamic State."
Recently, the media often reports about the presence of Russian troops on the territory of Syria.
The head of the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russian soldiers are already in Syria for many years and help Syrians master the technique to apply it against Islamists.
Four died when police opened fire rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police started shooting rubber bullets into the crowd, protesters against the country's proposed new constitution, an official spokesman said below Wednesday.
The violence happened in the evening on Tuesday in the district of Rupandei, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the district police chief, reported that more than 1,000 protesters gathered at one of the police departments, some throwing stones and inflammatory bombs.
Mr Dakal reported that police used tear gas, then fired into the air, before being put in the way of rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which, as we know, can be killed, but they have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, caused such a high mortality.
This clash was the latest in a few weeks of violent protests in the southern part of Nepal, where the Madesplain officials claim that the new provinces, and formed under the new constitution, would reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in the west of Nepal, among citizens of the nation who want to have a staff package.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes since 10
In August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in the province, which is a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been carried out since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted for the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter will be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise on 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s last century as the center of the chemical industry, has a well-developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago the new mayor Oleg Borovsky was headed by Sayansk.
On the results of the first year of work on new projects and prospects, he told the "Regional" correspondent.
Oleg, why have you started work as mayor?
In the first place I familiarized with the results of inspections of financial and economic activity, initiated an independent auditor examination of local budget spending.
Then the revision of the municipal property was carried out.
One of the first practical steps was reduced circulation up to five days.
Earlier papers could go through agencies, for months.
Measures were designed to raise revenue base and optimize costs.
In November last year in Sayansk was held a government meeting where the issues of social and economic development of the field were considered.
There were no designs in the city (PSD) nor on one object.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with preparation of PSD on roads, kindergarten, northern sewage collector and waterborne guide.
Road works have already been carried out at two sites now.
How about a presidential decree to construct kindergartens in the city is carried out?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demographics in the city have not been observed for the past 27 years.
So the question of the availability of places in kindergartens today is one of the most topical.
From 1 September closed to overhaul the kindergarten No.10, designed for 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million rubles.
So far the city has never received such funds.
Last year after the renovation opened kindergarten № 23, which is now visited by 200 children.
Repairs were made on conditions of co-financing from regional and local budgets, its cost was more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and regional government assistance to purchase of furniture and equipment were conceived, the program helped and means "National Initiatives" works.
There are plans to start building a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the sequence of children aged between one and a half to three years.
We have no queues for children from three to seven years.
Investors are showing interest in the area?
We have a clear understanding that the construction in the city should be engaged in, first and foremost, we need to employ them, namely sayang enterprises.
In October, a 60-apartment house has already been commissioned for orphans in fancy Leningradsky district.
With regard to the building, I would add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya, who entered the economy-class housing construction program.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
We all said about the construction of 10 thousand square meters of housing to participate in the program, which is very much desired.
One of the conditions - housing should be no more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this price includes a "turnkey" finish.
If we cope with specified amounts, then we will continue to participate in the program.
When it comes to investors, we have other interesting projects.
In his time, which was built on the territory of Saanskiy pig in 2004 was sold for cheap package.
We are working with prosecutors on appeal of this deal.
Especially as the earth beneath the object is in federal property.
Work with Moscow, decided the issue of transfer of 88 hectares in the regional property, with the subsequent transfer of land in the municipality.
There is a potential investor, ready to invest in reconstruction and launch the project of 1.5 billion rubles.
There will be 900 jobs with the pig, which will be set for a big city to help him.
In Sayansk developed social partnership institution?
We have concluded about 140 agreements of social and economic partnership.
Many projects have managed to carry out thanks to active social position of business representatives.
Tangible support companies such as UAB Vostok-Center, Novo-Ziminskaya CHP, LLC "Sayansky broiler, LLC "PC MDF, management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Directly to the city "Sayansky broiler" LLC gave the city a children's town, "East-Center" company carried out repairs of the horse yard, where specialists are engaged with children, having spent more than 1 million on this ipaterapia rubles.
Thanks to the sponsorship funds managed to get comfortable territory of the city's registry office.
Sponsors have helped colorful mark City Day.
As in the good old days there was a parade with the participation of city groups and organizations.
The chronicle of the city has been released, the book of Saian poets.
The primary builders and people who have made a serious contribution to the development of Sayanska were awarded the jubilee medals work.
Philanthropists are also involved in the work of the city's charitable foundation.
The first step was acquiring instruments for young talented musicians.
For nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles is aimed at supporting talented children to help children in need of expensive treatment, support for children from low income families.
How to solve human problems in the social sphere of Sayansk?
The city lacks doctors and pedagogov-subject men.
To solve the personnel issue of great importance is providing housing specialists.
For the last year we have allocated five apartments for doctors, official housing received four teachers.
We have a housing program for the five years with the possibility to privatize it.
It plans to redesign the building, where another eight apartments will be built for teachers.
Teachers and doctors are also involved in the program "Housing for Russian families."
In the future, building houses for public-sector workers.
The most important thing is that the city has a working team with which I can solve the most difficult questions.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all the crises, but life won't stop.
Sayansk and our region has a great potential.
The Duma introduced a bill on the indexation of social pensions, taking into account price growth.
The State Duma introduced a bill providing for the indexation of social pensions annually from 1 February, taking into account price growth.
The author of the document - an MP from "Just Russia," Alexander Lomakin-Rumantsev - also proposes to spend an additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the pace of growth of the subsistence level exceeds the rate of increase in prices for goods and services.
The indexation of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is produced annually from April 1, taking into account the growth of the living wage of the pensioner in Russia over the past year.
The draft law, introduced by the lower chamber, envisages the introduction of social pension indexation, taking into account the growth of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexing has been moved to February 1, and the second holding is held on 1 April.

Google launches campaign of doubling donations to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the beginning of a campaign of doubling donations intended to collect $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping flood European countries refugees who flee from war-torn and who impoverished countries.
Google used an uncharacteristic personal approach, announcing campaign collecting donations in his blog.
Instead of a statement made one of the executives, a Google employee Rita Masood, who fled with his family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described his personal experience.
"We traveled on dubious trains and buses, tolerate hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, plenty of people such as my family desperately need help.
Donations will be given to four nonprofit organizations engaged in assistance to refugees and migrants: "Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, an organization Save the Children and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that it would be doubling the first $5.5 million in donations, as long as the amount does not reach the $11 million page of google.com/refugeerelief.
Europe faces the strongest refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by him for much of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has moved more than 4 million people over this year.
Many also flee from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya out of wars.

Diabetics with little obesity could help obesity surgery
A favorable effect after obesity surgery in people with little obesity, type 2 diabetes, can last at least five years suffering, according to a new study.
However, it is still early to assert that diabetics are living longer after obesity surgery with little than those who receive non-surgical treatment of obesity.
"The mortality statistics are not immediately evident," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who wrote about the new study in JAMA Surgery editor's column.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of the organization to absorb food patterns.
For several years, bariatric surgery has proved to be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes, but the basic research was carried out among people with morbid obesity (BMI), which became a BMI of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal at value from 18.5 to 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or above suggests that a person's excess weight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered people with obesity.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from the Taiwanese hospital Min-Sheng General used data collected since 2007, to compare the two types of bariatric surgery -- gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy lab, with medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with little obesity.
The average BMI of those who had undergone surgery fell from 31 to 24.5, by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, IMT in those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes, remains at about 29.
Among those who underwent surgery were completely cured of diabetes by 36%, and partially - 28%.
In the group that had received medical treatment, for comparison, there was only 1% complete cure for diabetes, and only about 2 per cent have had a partial.
In addition, rates of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the surgical group," the authors claim.
The researchers also monitored the levels of hemoglobin levels in the blood, which reflect on blood sugar А1in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c better hold below 7%," the researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, he remained stable, at around 8%.
But the best indicators of glycaemic control, reflected good levels of hemoglobin A1c, have not reduced mortality rates for five years, according to the head of research by Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, in comparison with the group, which has a half-sleeve gastrectomy, the band chunting lost more weight (18.7 kg against 14.s2 kg), has achieved a greater reduction in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin (3.1% vs. 2.1%), as well as А1was closer to full remission of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of surgical technique in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from research on overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone from the College of Medicine at the University of Phoenix, Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for people with obesity who have chosen bariatric intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was about 29% lower compared with the group in which more traditional methods were applied.
Although the new study found no increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it was reassuring people with a BMI below 35, interested in such a procedure.
"The report is very important here, because it argues that such surgery is safe in a group with a low BMI, where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to seriously treat the weight as soon as a patient's BMI falls into the range between between 27 and 30.
"I think we are waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that as soon as they will accumulate genetic changes that run into their bodies of obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to turn back.
In Mytishchi the robbers walked away from the house of fur and 9 million rubles.
In Mytishchi robbers attacked the residents of Moscow suburb and stole from them 9 million rubles at home and three women's coats.
Interfax informs about it with reference to the press-service of the Interior Ministry.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unidentified assailants entered the house through an open front door, located on Gorky Street, tied a 20-year-old son at home and, threatening both with a knife, kidnapped 9 million housewives and three fur rubles.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, opened a criminal case under article "The fight."
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to place themselves among tourists who come to watch the World Cup in 2018.
Other hotels are still in no hurry to receive the appropriate permission.
According to experts, this is a very worrying sign.
In the run-up to the world championships, the authorities urgently need to invent how to spread out all the guests of the city.
"Rosbalt" interlocutors believe that the cost of renting apartments will grow by 10-30% because of the tournament, with removable and removable housing will have to pay for after the tournament.
The World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the condition of Russian hotels.
By law, written specifically for primacy, each hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo classification procedure and prove that corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that it will not be able to do everything: hoteliers are so wary of checks, which are often not even sending documents to requests by the Federal Antimonopoly Service for St Petersburg.
As the head of UFAS Vadim Vladimirov said, the department has studied 138 hotels and now plans to open 34 cases with regard to hotels, many of which have simply not responded to antitrust.
There are signs that the leadership of three dozen companies lied citizens, placing a number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov said.
The problem is that the account is now literally every single room, you can't lose in front of the 2018 year.
Officials suspect that during the football championship fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now tourists can count on 30.5 thousand rooms in the city.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg, 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotel - 100 - two- and three-star, 550 one-star.
According to the First Deputy Committee on Tourism Development Nana Gwichie, at this point, only 23 hotels took place - so many inspections carried out accredited classification company in St. Petersburg.
But whether a similar procedure for regional enterprises has ordered, Smollocated by an amazing coincidence is unknown.
There may be more, but none of the past classification doesn't know about it.
"Over the past six months, hotels have not really sought to undergo classification" - acknowledged the director of the Northwest branch of the Russian Union of Tourism Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is explained by the high season, during which hoteliers earn most of the money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets, which have not been laid in expenses for inspection, while the procedure can cost between 30 and 100 thousand rubles depending on the status of the hotel and more.
But lately, managers of hotels have become activated and began to apply for classification assured Shadian.
Hotels should be done before July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but also would not get the right to work for the World Cup.
Already it is known that depending on the celebrity will be developed a fixed fee for a room at the hotel during the tournament.
The formula, which will be calculated by the cost, are made public in the next year.
This is done in order to prevent price hikes at 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
We need to have a conscience and to prevent the increase in two or three times, but also the hotels should be earned.
"I think growth will be up to 50%," explained Russian Hotel Association president Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not sure that price fixation corresponds to an understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how this fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure would be justified.
"It's better than rampant appreciation," he said.
It is unclear what will happen to those popular cheap.
Duma deputies introduced a bill under which hostels should be banned in residential homes.
We hope that this law will not be accepted or will not affect St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved," Nana Gachia said.
However, she said, owners of mini-hotels in any case should be prepared to strengthen the Housing Code.
If the Duma does approve the bill, it will close about 80 per cent of hostels in St. Petersburg, and currently there are 1.5 thousand rooms in them.
According to the president of the Federation of restaurateurs and hoteliers in Northwest Leonida Garbar, Petersburg lacks two and three star hotels, which both times and demand football fans, but there is a bias towards hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is analogous to the situation when "on a 80-thousand stadium 75 thousand vips sit."
This can be corrected just at the expense of the mini-hotels.
Their possible ban expert believes "idiotism": "It seems strange to me that some people can live in flats, but for some reason the visitors cannot."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that this is wrong.
But if as a hotel in which guests come for a short time, then why not?
Mini-hotels are at risk of missing the World Cup; and because of their slug
Hundreds of small hotels are simply not having to undergo classification, complete with a pit digging themselves.
By the summer of 2016 order works will be all the city's hotels.
"Companies that can carry out this procedure are not so much, so they will abandon less paid orders from mini-hotels, and choose the ones that will be destroyed," said Gennady Lamshin, adding that more money in some cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, is significantly higher than St Petersburg's currently passed inspection scores.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is connected with permanent pieces in the tourist bloc including the government, which does not promote an re-united work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels don't have enough, they will probably need to pay attention to all regional hotels and holiday homes.
For example, in celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, guests will be able to mobilize the river fleet, i.e. the tournament cities may live in cabins.
Besides, many fans prepare to come on wagons, which will be immediately possible to spend the night.
"The important thing is not to set up so many hotels, then they remained empty," said Gennady Lamshin.
Also very popular during the football championship will use removable housing.
Most likely in the city would create a reserve of removable apartments.
Rental rates will rise by 10-30%.
"From the obvious - the first to leave home near the stadium," said a specialist in rental property development and research agency Larisa Bragina.
And the price of the lease may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
It will also contribute to the construction of new road junctions on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
We should not forget about the human qualities of citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is confident that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people do not simply suggest a road, but they can also hold a mini-tour.
There are also complications.
My dad was in 1970, in the yard - father, mother and two children met a family from Murmansk.
It turned out that there was no place to spend the night with hotels, then it is difficult at the station to sleep hard.
"And Dad brought them into our communal apartment to sleep," he remembered the interlocutor.
However, he added that there were currently no such features in the city's inhabitants - to call home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But perhaps in 2018 after unsuccessful Duma, hoteliers and governments decisions will have to remember past mistakes?
Zhirinovsky "merged" Amur region.
With admiration today looked at Zhirinovsky's clowado in the State Duma.
He did such things when our generation was still only learning to sell newspapers, and is still in great shape.
"The theme of the speech seems to be a protest against the election results in the Amur Region LDPR."
Protocols are not shaking for nothing; other protocols, except apparently signed by elected LDPR, have no Communist.
Here he raises took second place Ivan Abramova and shouting has something like: "Here is the winner of the election!"
And then no why, then, is plunging into Rodnin after already taking the faction with presiding shouting matches from the chamber, screaming literally "you all with fronts your swindlers and thieves."
The press, of course, gives the emphasis not on Abramova, but as a consequence of this scandal and abuse scandal and demarche faction.
Realistically Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region along with Abramov.
For the whole country it is another trick of the Zhirinovsky in style "Podrace!," rather than a protest of a political party against the results of specific elections.
And, if the faction has formally decided to believe the party and election candidate al-Feysbuku Ivan Abramova, the site has not recognized, but the leader with themes clearly makes a tear.
Provides dead on Amure themselves to bury their dead, and itself is blessed with "United Russia" as a whole and not anything against forgiveness Rodnina.
Elegant decision not to lose, and in the present, rather than face scandal not to go ostentatious.
It is another matter that now appears in a strange situation and Abramov himself.
But he did not see anything from bosses yelling at himself, there was no protocol of alternative hands.
He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for the narrow circle, it became a formal occasion and for insulting a respected champion, and that is still steep, hamian attacks against EP and ONF.
And then, of course, he needs to think very seriously what to do.
Because the main beneficiary of elections, policy number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 on the only regional single-mandate district could turn into a pariah, which had successfully enjoyed his own party leadership and super-irritant for the UNF and party leadership alien.
There certainly wouldn't be Zhirinovsky, he might have come up with - and respectful for him to watch.
He has yet to grow and grow to cling.
There was also news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next film arches.
That is why no bath has fallen at all.
The only topic Abramova under a basement bla.
Beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible that everyone came to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists urged to stop violence in countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama's compassion Centre at Oxford, devoted to research ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this is admired, Western European countries" response to the refugee crisis is not adequate to the situation.
"It is not possible that all come to Europe apart," he said in his speech.
Though the Dalai Lama has been highly recalled about the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
"The concern for thousands of refugees - fine, but at the same time you need to think about long-term solutions, and how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, in these Muslim countries," he said.
In the end, we need to think about how to reduce the number of homicides in their countries.
We need to weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the strong reaction from the US launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is possible through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he has used force, and this has caused them unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
A fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed up the disinfectant for hands, for the last 4 years
Toxicological centers in the United States reported an almost 400-percent increase since 2010, the number of children under 12 years old, who had swallowed up the disinfectant for hands with high alcohol content, according to Georgia State Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, cases of pro-children up to 12 years of fluids for disinfection of hands glata reported to toxicological centers increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"The children contact with these substances more frequently and, unfortunately, some percentage of them are sent to the emergency department," Lopez told CNN.
He explained that some children drink a disinfecting liquid specifically, and some do it to impress their friends, or on an argument for social networks.
On the YouTube videos, you can see how teenagers drink disinfecting liquid as a cheap drink.
The teenagers reportedly mixed disinfecting liquid with an alcohol-containing liquid to rinse the mouth in order to get a more potent drink.
More younger children can attract a pleasant smell of disinfecting fluid.
"The child doesn't think it can hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (disinfecting fluids for their hands) - those that are flavoring.
There is a disinfectant liquid to hand with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
A disinfecting liquid for hands contains somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol.
Young children, in particular, have only a handful of spray can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This spirt of high concentration," told Fox 4 in Kansas City Dr Stephen Thornton, Chief Physician of Toxicology Center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave the glass with whiskey, but people keep in mind these disinfectants for their hands, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume large amounts of alcohol.
Naidge Russell, 6-year-old girl who recently at school swallowed the disinfectant for a hand with strawberry flavour in the amount of approximately four spray, was sent for treatment in the emergency department.
Alcohol levels in her blood were 179, twice as much as an adult, which by law is considered to be in a state of alcoholic intoxication, according to those of Dr. Chris Ritchie - a doctor who treated her emergency medical center in Gwinnett near Atlanta.
Naidge had words and could not walk when she was taken way to the ambulance.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic, so as not to miss any signs of brain injury because because of alcohol, the girl fell and hit her head told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," told CNN Ortoria Scott, Naigi's mother.
It might well prove fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use unlocking substances or disinfectant napkins, located in addition of honor to remove disinfectant liquid would reach the hands of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids linked to the deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after being swallowed up or disinfectant that contained a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol - a lethal agent rather than ethyl alcohol, which was specified as the current substance.
In January, three students in the north of New York were a fourschooler of their "anti-poison" teacher conspiracy by "spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom," according to a police report.
A teacher has a strong allergy to disinfectors for hands, and she has forbidden to keep them in their class.
Police believe that the failed plan was "empty talk," which will address issues of discipline and school districts.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance of the children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya stinksad cast-iron owl.
Kids who come for books try to feed her sweets.
Already several generations come to this library within 95 years.
The very first readers in the 20s of the last century, organized here loud reading, staged performances under verses Mayakovsky put literary quiz and corresponded with the wife of Lenin.
Correspondence lasted four years and, as the newspaper wrote in 1939, "Young Stalinets, "every day "friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of children's library city of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent her child's photo once distant barnaul friends.
But when asked if the barnaulans were not opposed to Nadezhda's name, the library was not opposed, she wrote.
Letters long in the museum, and grandchildren and great-dust will first have to explain to readers whose harsh profile walls is decorated with a bas-relief on the building of the library.
During perestroika, often called different people were outraged: why doesn't a children's library renamed?
Let there be a library named after some good children's writer, without political colour!
Library employees sat, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, like "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - a path from the yellow brick.
"The magician of the emerald city" - a favorite topic of the artist Oli Moskovki.
Earlier, Olya was a manager at a law firm, came to work at eight, went to five, and from all the other managers differed only by his passion for drawing.
And then found online announcement: "It requires an illustrator for a book."
A little American girl wrote a book, and she was called "My Cancer mommy" - "my mother has cancer."
Olya did illustrations, and thought: life could end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it, if you do not create them yourself..
Now she works in a library, illustrates children's books of writers all over the world and composes herself tales.
It is traditionally considered that children lose interest in the book that they increasingly live in some virtual space...
But certain readers go to children and their parents understand signs reading," says Tatyana Kushkind. "Russian planet library director
In recent years, we have even emerged that such a moment of confidence is needed, and it will be a children's library that children are going to live here! -
I think the interest in reading is returning.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained with updated photographic exposure.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers who go to the library are displayed by the whole family: mom, dad and children.
In the library are rejoicing that children are increasingly coming to the Pope.
If in two years the child read only Chukovsky more senior age he needs books tricky.
But now there is a law, under which eight years it has forbidden to issue books from category 12 + wunderkind.
To receive such a book, the child must bring their parents - they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes something of a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library with pre-revolutionary collection, epic, and lead by Korolenko gave an attachment to the magazine "Niva device," "Murzilka" undercover for 1936.
After all, we are not only a conceptual space "temple, "now we are open to movement, we try to book a special place: not home, not work, not be a school," explains Tatyana Kushkind.
You can come to us all together to read, play, draw.
We have made a play area for kids - the child comes just to play, but something still stretches to book! cro
Some of our readers are parents, and they don't want to go, leaving legs falling.
Often come mothers with strollers - and we are pleased that the library they put in first place among all the other places where you need to come with kids.
Tatyana Kushlook says: modern kids just like we once, love classic children's literature:
"Publishing is now developing, and much attention is paid to the authors, who are the link between generations."
But if we are talking about small children, it is important that there was some kind of hero who races from one book to another traveling.
Kids don't like to part with their heroes.
The library is constantly releasing booklets for parents, which describes what is happening in modern children's literature, which books should pay attention to and why.
The booklets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
Bear books outside the reading room for adults is prohibited.
This magic privilege is only for children.
... In the most distant room of the library there is a square with an ancient wooden staircase into the basement door of the book safe seat.
Steps will be considered under your steps - it's already a very old machine time crypto.
With the book of his childhood you meet, as with an old friend: Hello, it is good that we do not change with you.
Ellie is still having fun walking tall on the road, paved with yellow bricks, band Tolai Ryzhikov stealing my magic matches, while Malchish-Kibalchish never told the cursed burins Military Mystery - so he has a hard day word.
Books such as passwords, you can find them anywhere on their own.
There are in storage and real bookrarities - for example, pre-revolutionary collection epic with aties and ers.
Or to lead Korolenko in the famous "Niva" magazine app.
Or the "Murzilka" cover for 1936.
Time has aged pages, has divided them into a tea break color.
These publications are no longer issued to readers.
These fragments of our future collection, I always dream - go out for retirement and take rare children's books. mush
But the kids on it already, so to speak, will not tell: and paint in old books are not very bright, and themes... open the first page, and there - Lenin, party, Komsomol.
Now it seems: why did we all give this "PionPVC the truth?"
But still it was interesting," said Galina Ilysova, "Russian world" Head of the book storage facilities.
"Murzilka" pages turned darker from time to time.
Galina Vasilyevna is head of the book security Pole all his life.
She knows what color cap Buratino, in which academic year Harry Potter has become the captain of the Gryffindor quidditch team at the championship, in what situations Carlson uses a dampener for motor, and who's the father of Alice Selezneva works.
Librarian pay little for work, and anyone who can live without these bookranks very quickly find themselves another profession.
Only the most convinced remain: enlighteners, teachers, ministers of cult book.
You can find out more about them and smile - it is thought that this is a professional feature of children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation - it is a professional.
I love children's books: how I like to be librarian for exactly and beautifully stood on the shelves, and I love to read them again," said Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.
Read contemporary Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, it seems to me, in my childhood, everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that was happening to me at that time.
And because I loved them, it seemed to me that the library is a totally magical place.
And I wanted to work there, where all sit and read.
I hope the books will always, despite the rigors.
And rejoice when our former readers lead children and even grandchildren...

Why I am a witness to executions in Oklahoma
Today, by shying away from legal intervention at a later stage, I will watch how the men are executed.
If that happens, and I hope that all the same, I will not sit on the viewing gallery on death row in Oklahoma prison, when Richard Glossip will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
This request was first made in January, through his close friend, and even though I was in shock, I agreed. sends off
With this day approaching, I became afraid.
So why do it?
I agreed because they thought it was a good way to tell the detailed history of the death penalty.
It would have offered a unique racourse.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and, as more often than seats, the results of the grim lottery wish to decide who will be selected.
The number of seats for the press reduced from 12 to five in Oklahoma.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I will sit with the close friends of Richard Glossipa, and we have a relationship with him after several months of phone calls and one personal visit emerged which had lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration argues that I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I wouldn't be allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I have to try to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter that I'm doing my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell us a story of the prisoner as he likes, get access.
I have complained to her.
She acknowledged that she "could have and better articulate," but still believes that I am wrong in what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip did not agree with some of what I have said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, but I wouldn't do it, even if he spoke.
I told him that he could wipe me out of his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international newspaper journalist to present there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that the publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Belver, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to podcasts, which I recorded.
I'm not going to go into details here again.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of aiding and abetting crime.
But I believe that there is a high probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was not enough evidence for a death sentence.
I believe that his execution was wrong.
And from this perspective, I will be watching how he dies.
I cannot say that I will be entirely objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can apply for this.
From me, you'll know what it's like to look like a person who I like, dies without necessity.
Persecuted police man persuaded climb out of Canning River
The constable from the town of Kanning-Weil managed to persuade my man to get out of the Canning River, but to remain dry.
Perth resident intended to walk away from the police, but failed, anchored in the muddy water in shallow water a few metres from a police officer attempting to "gently persuade him to come to shore."
Kanning-Weila police were called on Tuesday for an illegal intrusion on someone else's territory in Bakkingham.
When police spotted the suspect, he tried to walk away from them, throwing himself in Canning.
But he had not gone far enough.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going to go out, let's take me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell brought Kasldine.
I have not constable Laclanu Perhavetwet, so he used a safer form very much like "negotiations with a good police reception."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Kasldine.
Football champion Ben Cousins is exactly this and memorable iste.
In 2006, Kazins moved out in a ditch to avoid a meeting with a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to refloat Suit.
His efforts proved to be in vain, but whether local residents made a joke to invent "biathlon of Ben Kazinsa."
Peter Moody blames stewards in attempted espionage and threatens to withdraw from equestrian sport
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria stewards in an attempt to introduce a spy in his stables last year and threatened that immediately would leave horse racing.
His targets were stewards and Racing Victoria integrity department officers, whom he blamed for the fact that they organized a campaign personally against him, and removal from the start of Lady Tatai because of violations of the rules on the use of drugs in a day starting on Wednesday became the latest burdens.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always doing all efforts by participating in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation, when we were talking about the positive result of Lidari's sample on cobalt, which he could not explain.
He held his tongue on suspicion of espionage for about one and a half years and did not want it to "look like selen grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and for a long time, but sometimes you endured it so upset that you're no longer holding back," said Moody.
They know that it has lasted.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences and I ships will have to live with what I said.
Today I will go home and sleep tight.
I want to walk with his head held high, and I want my owners to know - I am doing everything possible for them.
When they begin to think that this is not the case, then I will need to stop being a coach.
Then I will have to think what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally claimed during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy in his stables.
"a year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat down in a room with a man whom I call, if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to transmit information about what I'm doing in my stables," said Moody at Racingnot .com.
They clearly believe that I am the fraudster.
If so, they should all certainly apply, as an attempt to catch them failed me.
Robert Rolston, the former chairman of RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondri, CEO of RVL, knew about all this esnanny and now know now.
Shouldn't it make me think that the case has become personal?
Shouldn't the RVL gain courage and to bring to account for what is happening in this business, other people, apart from the coaches?
Whether I am bad for this profession?
So whether I'm bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they need to take away my license and push me away, and I have no doubt - what I am saying now can make them think about it.
But now I've got to the point where I don't care, and it saddens me.
I am truly sad from this.
I will continue to put pressure on them and they have the responsibility to make the decision.
I have the support of the family, and I can walk away.
The coach only grew in the course of a long investigation of the annoyance with cobalt and Lidari, and the last case of a horse from the start made it clear that he would withdraw "throwing his license on the table."
Moody, best known by the fact that he has prepared the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of medical drugs on the day of competition "ridiculous" after the horse's leg was struck from clay, which is a violation of the rules compress.
This is a violation of rules on the races.
"I must bear full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly made her kompress on the leg.
She could get a compress yesterday evening.
She could get him yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody may be disqualified for three months under the rules regarding the use of medical drugs in a day of competition for the use of compression, about which the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's an anecdote.
People creating these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy will pair rivals' charges in applying tough security techniques
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called the criticism of intercepting the ball his team" as "imposing the agenda" by the two NRL championship favorites.
Sydney Rustlers coach Trent Robinson said the judges "allowed" "Storma" "fight" with his team during their final qualifying game in a sudden victory in Sydney at Storma on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett has made clear on "The Storm" after his team Namok won the final qualifying tournament at Nozern Queensland Kauboz" on Saturday night, when he called the game "typical" for rugby league and claimed that two of the Queensland teammates were not "too successful" in a melee fight.
Bellamy defended intercept the ball of his team and said they were simply focused on "touch," by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he inspired confidence in his team's criticism by two leading coaches, because it means that they are worried about possible defeat from "Storm."
"It continues to pop up - I haven't heard that Trent Robinson spoke about the tough sessions when they were taking us with a score of 24: 2 defeated," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I trust that we have not changed anything for a whole year in their systems or security techniques, just over the last six weeks we have paid particular attention to your contacts when the ball interception, and it was a turning point for us.
Trent there for three years and he obviously trains an excellent team, so he is probably not used to losing, and for him it was some shock.
It's funny how it always shows up at this time of year.
Bellamy did compete with Bennett's idea about "impressive football," reminding his teacher that "St George-Illawarra Dragons" Bennetta won the championship in 2010, showing "boring" football.
Wayne says about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and see how impressive was their game," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, "Saint George" many criticised, calling it a boring team, Wayne said that he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers to be an impressive football, especially their young midfielders with their speed.
This is football, which you would want to play when you have such players.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two such halfback Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they might as well play.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they drove up to big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game was "Storma" and "Rustlers" competition with more points than the game "Broncos" and "Kauboz."
"The Broncos" game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the account? 16-12?
In our game it was 20: 18, there were two more attempts - and that, this is an impressive football?
Or consider impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts?
It is routine for me.
If they mention about us, it means that at some stage we can meet with them there.
"Storma" at the end of this week's holiday, as they won the right to host either North Queensland Cowes," or "Kronalla Sharks" fighters next Saturday night in the preliminary final at AAMI Park stadium, tickets go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Accused of possessing drug serb released on bail at $200,000
The man, who faces life imprisonment for attempting to assign 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland by smuggling, was released on bail $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the yacht Solay, travelling from South America via Vanuatu and moored in Kumere died in August.
Throughout the morning, Maksimovic and his accomplices were seen at the marina, and later he met with them at Coomera Roadhouse Cafe, where police found 40 kg of the drug in the car Toyota Echo.
Despite the fact that Maximovich faces a lifelong sentence for attempting to obtain narcotic substances in quantities sufficient for sale, Maksimovich's lawyer argues that there is no evidence that the latter was trying to get the whole party, and that the man could be in the cafe without any intent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should let go on bail.
The latter has had ties with Serbia.
He frequently travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
He lied to police about the location of his residence during the criminal proceedings.
The mother and stepfather Maximovich was asked to make a joint pledge of $200,000 for his release.
"The testimony of both becomes obvious that the amount of collateral of $200,000 is too great a financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But this measure is not enough as a guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maksimovic was allowed to be free on bail on condition that he surrenders his Australian, as well as a Serbian passport, will be celebrated in police daily and abide by a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: "proud of the national team of Greece, which was hitting until the last seconds."
Greece's head coach Fotis Katsikaris paid tribute to his team after the match 1/4 final Eurobasketball 2015 with Spain (71: 73 -).
According to him, the game's fate decided individual mistakes.
It was a big game," AFP quoted Katikarisa.
We were preparing for an excellent game in the performance of the Spaniards.
Tried to work in defense, but defense mistakes determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "In CSKA will be designated as Cauna on me."
Newcomer CSKA Joel Freeland said he did not believe in the curse of army men.
Also the British has expressed confidence that his new club can break the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke with coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team," was quoted by R-Sport "Frilda. "Actually, I will be assigned to Sasha Kauna functions as the team left in both defensive constructions and in attack from three-second zone, I think I can cope with it.

Now I will have to confront the big center opponent, but more so before already engaged in serious and now I think I will cope.
Soldiers last won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then, they have traveled six times to "Final Four," but they could not show their best basketball every time.
It is believed that the team has someone seyes.
In this whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's difficult, I understand all the frustration of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team right now, and if we are going to show the best that are capable of, then we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
Always wanted to win this title, Muscovites have already defeated in the tournament, and I think this year will be a year of CSKA.
As regards the eyes, then I am not superstitious person and do not believe snot in what curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you connect those two things, then anything is possible.
I have no certain rituals before games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.

Stivan Hogg used the girl's phone to get pedophiles to send photos
Pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to begging images of violence against children.
Stivan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep, registered in an online messaging service, where he received a number of lewd images of children sent by another user.

Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to cut from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring program and reducing costs in the provision of services.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies by separating production of computers and printers from more rapidly developing hardware and service operations sectors.
Deductions as a result of the proposed job cuts would amount to about US $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new company Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organisation after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard at present, while the company's portfolio of business will be wider and deeper, which will help the transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and "will be focused on providing previously unachievable integrated technology solutions" to companies, according to a company statement.
So split the company, formed in the 1930s years of Stanford University graduates Bill Houston and Dave Pakard for the production of electrical equipment; flying their garage in Palo Alto has nicknamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a major reorganization aimed at the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
Such a move by HP, the second-largest producer of personal computers and one of US technology companies in the world - the latest event in this sector, based on the confidence that highly specialized companies work better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his one-club men should support the injured Jack Wilshire before playing with Dynamo Zagreb'
In conversation with Wilshre Wenger also stressed that still only September, and what if the Wilshire recovery will go according to plan, then nothing would prevent his return to the game for Christmas.
Under the most favourable developments Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
Hurt most in this recent issue that Wilshere confidently finished the previous season with the only ankle injury and was going to return to the familiar aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury does not threaten his career."
It just was not until the end of the healing bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
It is not connected with the ankle or the injuries that he had previously covered.
It can be related things from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger admitted, there is also a risk of additional injury for any player associated with that returning to play in the middle of the season.
There is also the unfavorable trend.
According to Premier injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries that have occurred with him for six years since his debut.
In addition, he has played only 65 of the 157 games at Arsenal in the league over the past five seasons.
If you look at the alignment for Arsenal, you may notice that in six of eight seasons, increasingly since 2007-08, Arsenal was one of two Premier League clubs, on account of which most missed due to injury days.
Wenger admits the likelihood of "stuck in a vicious circle, but in Arsenale" believe that improving injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, returning after injury, you go online for a while - during this time you need to recover and get exposed," said Wenger with a competitive advantage.
Jack is young enough and will cope.
I hope that he will recover physically, I am sure in this, as well as the fact that his career will be such that he deserves.
Arsenal are starting to campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday with Dynamo Zagreb and will continue its match in Saturday games with Chelsea and the following Wednesday - with Tottenham Hotspur," and Wenger intends to hold a team rotation.
Héctor Belerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, therefore most likely in the starting lineup will play Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta.
Perhaps Wenger will also introduce a member of Kirana Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain a balance and give a small reprieve to those players who need it," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal absolute favourite in Group F, Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among the most devastating in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of the 41 matches since they have managed to spend last season as "Invincible."
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was affected by an earthquake force of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb earlier this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have learned the lesson received last season when the team was defeated in the Champions League game against Monaco, and remains with little hope of leading the club to victory in the final of the Champions Cup.
"It's an incredible drive," said Wenger.
Arsenal have never done before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that has taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The lack of such stories catches the eye, especially when one considers how desperate the need of men in frankness has become more than ever now that the suicide rate among young men is at the maximum for 15 years.
In 2013, it became the single biggest cause of death of men aged between 20 and 45 years in the UK, and with men it happens three times more often than with women.
In an attempt to resolve the issue of "Campaign Against a miserable life," announced the 2015 Year of Men in order to challenge a culture that does not allow men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study, more than 2,000 university students who have shown symptoms of depression, found that if a patient has a sufficiently large number of friends "in a normal mood," the chances of cure are doubled.
Similarly to those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends twice reduces the chance of mental illness.
But, of course, that friendship worked, first and foremost, that she should be.
In an era when communications are managed by social networks when style content, quick answers are often valued more than prefer meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving fun and successful, even if the reality of loneliness reigns.
This superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our internal desire for personal growth and friendship that stronger influences our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently observed, the creator of video games for money doesn't actually buy more happiness.
The dignity of Friends is that they draw attention to this.
Each of the characters was determined not through their work, but rather through personality, which manifested itself in communication with friends.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's constant embrace, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross on Rachel - all will come from breathing understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from a full examination of their feelings.
As "Samaritens" employee told me:..." my role of listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal mood underscores how even the little communication of friends can benefit."
Often, those men who turn to us feel unable to speak with friends.
The old teaching "live with it" had much the same as the feeling that frank conversation about problems can be perceived as weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer more sustainably working coping mechanisms.
It highlighted little-notable moments of male friendship.
As regards my task, the status of a stranger, talking on the phone, helps people in moments of despair, for long-term support comes from the close circle of family and friends too.
So, if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, where for the holiday completely restored the scenery, why not take your friends drink at Central perk.
Or, even better - if you see a lonely person in Starbucks, smile and say "Hello."
In advance not to guess what kind of favor can bring friendship.
TV series Friends show on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, according to thego # FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal, helping "PSG" defeat "Malmö"
Ángel di Maria alongside Matuidi and Edinson Cavani Blez celebrates scored goals at the gate "Malmö."
Ángel di Maria, started in the Champions League, scored for a goal than allowed "PSG" easy to circumvent "Malmö" on Tuesday.
Here's a report about the match and the reaction to the game.
Ángel di Maria and Edinson Cavani made their case when "Pari Saint-Germain" started their game in the Champions League with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at Park de Prens" stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the Champions League began as a player of "PSG," to set the direction of the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increased their advantage when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, "Pari" needed to take a good start in the game against champions Sweden because they have focused not on the qualification playoffs, but for the continuation of a series of successful games the last three seasons, where they reach the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time, it was not the best decision by Laurent Blanc to count Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the field in a game against a team from his native city and the club, in which he began his magnificent career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or in the Champions League, so to win together with a score of 2: 0, to deliver opponents of problems and play a great defense is a good starting point, even if there are still moments that we will need to finalize during the season," said Blanc.
This is promising.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I regret that we haven't scored one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic came back after an injury in one of the substitutions as part of the Parisian team, which brought her a draw with a score of 2: 2 in the match against Bordeaux in the first league at the weekend, but he shifted" his background to Di Maria's fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker pointed out as a player able to withdraw "PSG" to a new level in Europe after he was bought by Manchester United last month, and he proved why with when he ran onto a pass from Marco Verratti behind defending "Malmö" and beautifully completed the attack, sending the ball past Johana Villanda into the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone was expecting an easy and big victory from "PSG" then they had to be disappointed.
"Malmö," which defeated Celtic in the playoffs to reach this stage, having included nine world-class players on the field early in the game, five defenders and two midfielders in midfield, there was a serious enemy pivot.
But except for the hit, Nikola Djurdjic, in which the ball flew past the distant rod gates of Kevin Trappe in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
But "PSG" has at times underwater itself and weak attacks, especially the gears nonultative from Ibrahimovic, who only failed to realize at least five tries in the first half, and then couldn't handle the ball, scored Cavani immediately after the resumption of play.
Nevertheless, he showed himself to be a much more skillful in precise pass and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, having gained which Di Maria sent the ball curled back, which passed a wyrblow past the 52-minute Vilanda Stange.
The second goal was finally beaten after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, Uruguay scored his sixth goal of the season after after Ibrahimovic ruled the ball sent to the center of the field under the left flank with Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that were "Malmö" about returning to the game, and only to intercept the ball Wilandom with close range did not allow David Louisa to increase the final score before released to replace Esekjell Lavezzi cannot go to the end of the match during the match read.
Malmö FF coach Аге Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, while the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then we have played only in the Swedish league, and this is not the level.
Qualifying is not enough.
"Pari" glory!
It was a wonderful match with them.

About the upcoming event in Sochi and interim results of cooperation tells honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen, Vladimir Shcoal, a member of the official delegation included.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what tasks puts the Sochi forum?
A large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on fruitful cooperation between regions - important links of relations between the two states.
It is planned that the plenary meeting will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.
As part of the plenary and section sessions we will talk about the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, regulatory and legal services and programs of the Union State.
The governor of the Tyumen region will perform at the forum.
I think that this is evidence of a successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The forum will also visit representatives of relevant ministries and agencies, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will work, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help make new profitable contracts and agreements.
I would add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates took part in his work, including from 19 regions of Russia.
It was then signed a very important agreement on cooperation between Tyumen and Minsk regions.
Talking about the importance of our developments and the fact that the meeting took place in Tyumen during parliamentary meeting of the Union of Russia and Belarus, permanent seminar.

The question of supplying the Belarusian agricultural machinery and using financial mechanisms are affected - they need to reduce the cost of cars for the end consumer.
Problems were discussed in the work of "Belshina" Tyumen trade house and options to prevent losses.
Questions are important, because investment projects must clearly work and bring profit for the region.

The conversation also touched upon the training of workers' delegation in Belarus until the end of this year the region's travel.
Another topic of discussion was the completion of the negotiation and signing of agreements on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation of Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promises to reach a new level.
These questions also touched the regional center.
During a meeting with the head of the city administration Tyumen Alexander Mowe talked about upgrading the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already "breathing on incense," because a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will run on gas, ecologically clean fuel.
One more aspect: Tyumen elevator plant works with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator production of JSC "Mogilevliftmash," receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the program for installing new elevators at the regional center.
I would add that as part of the expanded powers the consul met with the governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Kokorin, during which there was a discussion about increasing the turnover and supply of modern Belarusian equipment in the Trans-Urals region.
At the end of September, the planned meeting with the om. governor
In an extended consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a district headquarters.
The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including work in obrolling the honorary general consul.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good because they allow directly and quickly to solve many problems, removing the sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In current circumstances, it is extremely important not to destroy the foundation, continuing to work for the future.

During the Sunday release of the show Project greenlight on HBO channel, a well-known actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasise the need for alternative viewpoints to a major black heroine in the chosen scenario project.
"Diversity is appropriate when you spend casting for the movie itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
Blindly, not believing his ears being mistreated by Brown exclaimed "Ogo!" nothing of himself. "Well, well" all the time while the actor Marsianin gave comments in a live broadcast.
To discuss the finalists of the show to Damon and Brown have joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and brothers Farelli.
"I would want the participants - no matter who the director - would have thought what kind of image and they are going to stick to," treated Brown said at the beginning of the Harmondiscussions.
The only black character is a prostitute being beaten up by a white sutener.

"American Ninja Warrior" awarded the first champion
A professional scalolase and assistant waiter Isaac Caldiero on Monday night became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior," taking home the $1 million prize.
On this sports show, whose 7th season just ended, none of the participants managed to go through all the stages of the track with no further obstacles.
In the final season, the two participants - Caldiero and cameraman Jeff Britten, reached the final round.

The original complaint by Kadyrov on the book "Molba to God" came in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk court.
In Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk city court received the original appeal complaint by a representative of Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov's decision to recognize the "extremist material" book "Molba to God: its meaning and place in Islam," Interfax reports referring to the chairman of the city court Alexandra Chukhparadise.
The court now awaits possible objections participants in the process.
Chukhrai declined to comment on statements by some Duma deputies about the need to check the court for possible cooperation with foreign special services and ISIS mountains.
"let ourselves comment such stupidity," he said.
On September 11, the city prosecutor's office lodged an appeal against the decision of South Sakhalin judge Natalia Perchenko about recognizing the book "extremist material."
From the prosecutor's office in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk came the Appeal complaint on Friday evening.
There are nuances: prosecutors believe that they asked the court to recognize the extremist only opinion of the author of this book, not verses from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge took the wrong decision," said Chukhparadise.
The decision to recognise the book "extremist material" was taken on August 12, 2015.
In particular, "extremist" were named citations from the Quran - "You we worship and You pray for help," "Do not cry to whom along with Allah."
Kadyrov called taking the decision on the book "Shaytans and provocateurs."

Facebook will remove comments insulting migrants and refugees
"Facebook" employees intend to delete posts and comments, which are given a negative assessment of migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
To fight manifestations of xenophobia and racism in network management "Facebook" intends jointly with the German Ministry of Justice.
So, on the eve of the head of the department, Heiko Maas said that at present the minyst together with specialists of social network is engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Its members have a duty to monitor and delete incorrect comments towards migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is expected that the authors will receive notices indicating the reasons for removing the hosanatолерtheir records.
Illegal content blocking and organizations should also help prompt experts to collect complaints from social media users who received abusive posts.
"Facebook" leadership intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements against migrants and refugees, the social network's leadership and the ministry of justice in Germany was taken after the German "Facebook" segment sharply increased xenophobic sentiments.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was unprecedented in scope the migration crisis that gripped the EU countries some time ago.
So, in Germany today, all items designed to accommodate refugees are already overcrowded.
On the eve of the country's authorities have decided to temporarily settle migrants on the territory of the former concentration camp Buchenwald.

There will be zones for relaxation in Moscow cemeteries.
Soon several metropolitan cemeteries are equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be Butovskoye, Shcherbinskoye, and Domodedcemetery.

Further similar plots will appear in other areas of the city.

Zones for relaxation will be represented by a small green area, reminiscent of the parks.
According to specialists in such "corners" visitors to the cemeteries will be able to relax, to be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
Soon zones for relaxation will be built in Domodedovo, Butovsky and Scherbinsk cemeteries, and then in other districts of the capital.
According to the head of GBU "Ritual," if there is a need to expand the cemetery, builders will try to keep existing forests in areas of the maximum possible amount.
Green plants will serve as a living fence that will separate recreation zones and areas allocated directly below the site for burial.
GBU "Ritual" experts have also announced their intention to make an offer to refuse from the fences on the graves.
New cemeteries may indeed become non-barrier.
In addition, "Ritual" told about the readiness to engage in installing electronic terminals GBI, with the help of which visitors cemeteries will be able to learn the GPS coordinates and number plates of burial places.
In June this year in "Ritual" GBI also suggested that the cost of services for burial delays depending on the time of year.
So, digging a grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the ground stayed dead.
It should be noted that over the last year, prices for all kinds of ritual services have grown by an average of 10 per cent.
In the woods five days later she found his lost mushroom delnik.

To conduct Economics - Nobel laureate: globalization
To print the Processes of globalization had to contribute to reducing global inequality.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in incomes in developing economies, by contrast, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To fix this, you must raise the level of education of lower-skilled workers, says Senior Research Fellow at the International Laboratory of analysis and choice of decisions HSE, Nobel laureate in economics in 2007, Eric Maskin.
In the past twenty years, the world has experienced an unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization have predicted big gains for emerging economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," Maskin said.
So, for example, China and India have received a serious increase in GDP per capita.
However, not everyone is so rosy.
It was expected that globalization would reduce the gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" in poor countries, which manifests itself in large income inequality, or, more precisely, wages.
But in fact this inequality only increased, said Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, which translated and cited NIE HSE.
Together with an economist, Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory, which demonstrates why the difference in income growth in poor countries as globalization increases, recalls NIE HSE.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Maskin selects four levels of training specialists - A and B for the rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, professionals from poor countries lack the skill level to D cooperate with experts A and B from rich countries.
And if the salary level of workers from poor countries is growing thanks to cooperation with C employees from the rich, they do not feel the workers or B D growth at all. wages are falling
The final effect is that the internationalization of production will help increase the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and consequently increase the level of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin offered a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative Ricardian comparative advantage theory.
It makes it possible to explain why globalization has led to income inequality," said Fuad Aleskerov, ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory of analysis and choice of solutions, the head of the mathematics department at HSE.
And like any powerful theory, I am sure that it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
A solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of lower-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as a scientist, do not have this money, and says it isn't profitable for companies to pay for their training.
Governments can play a significant role in such a situation, international agencies, NGOs and private funds, says Maskin.
The scientist points out that the theory developed in no way calls to halt the process of globalization, which has brought and bears fruit in the form of countries" GDP growth.

Four hundred students tried themselves as airport staff.
For this it was mounted on the model three aviagDomodedova.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also serviced planes.
All this is in the form of a business game, but she did not succumb to reality in complexity.
Just two passengers with fractures on board were late flights, lost somewhere along the way to the plane trap.
For this airport is hell.
For those who settled in hangar - the standard set of jobs that are going to solve the newcomers Domodedova.

The U.S. Embassy regretted the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret in connection with the closure of the American Center Library for Foreign Literature who acted.
More than 22 years worked in the center of Moscow.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Center of the U.S. Embassy at the All-Russian State Library named after M.I.Rudomino in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times, are questioning the government's commitment to the relations between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the Cold War and in other difficult moments of the long history of relations between our countries," U.S. Ambassador John Tefft, said in a statement to Interfax. "The incoming
The American Center created deep and strong connections between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
He was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American prominent figures, among whom were astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Only last year the American Center conducted more than 400 cultural and educational events and took more than 50 thousand Russian visitors," the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program) educational exchange program.
The Green Tribunal appeared to be swift crackdown.
Typical situation: four officials stand in front of the desk judge Svatanter Kumar, listen to his claims of progress.
The court is absolutely not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We did not provide you a 110-page order for you to get over it," says Kumar, "enjoy themselves.
If there is even one brick, we will put all our existing buildings demolished.
Kumar leads the National Green Tribunal (NZT) - a judicial body established in 2010 to stem the rapid environmental pollution that accompanies rapid economic growth in recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal had considered more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological developments, toxic waste and construction of dams.
In two of the three cases, the court decides whether to stop construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: for nearly 60 years since independence, India's industrial development has changed from a country of virgin jungle growing into one of the most congested and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in big cities, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste businesses and households, and few remaining residential areas are being cut down for building new residential quarters.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the State Government, NZT regularly faces criticism from Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
So, in May of this year, the Environment Minister called the court's decision "extreme" and "impossible."
Sometimes the court decisions really cannot be performed in a court date, confirms a lawyer for environmental affairs staged by Raj Panjwani.
But deadlines are unrealistic and have a positive side: at least they make responsible persons move.
"His main aim is to shake up this system," added the lawyer gladly.
Green Tribunal has already repeatedly cancelled large buildings on his account: stopping the construction of the airport, power plant and hundreds of smaller buildings.
At the same time, about people try to not forget too: for example, during the discussion of the fate of the pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, polluted the local river fluoride show.
We can close your factory, but we are responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," he commented on his decision to Kumar.
But such explanations have not always found an understanding of ordinary people whose lives can change thanks to one stroke of judicial per piece.
So, in April, the tribunal decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital than had caused a nationwide outcry.
Despite sharply rising popularity and a flurry of criticism, Svatanouther Kumar refused to cancel the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Delhi government along with statistics about the vehicle entering and going out and made a proposal to buy 10 thousand additional buses after learning at factories, whether they are able to perform a similar pre-order.
As the court began to get into the spotlight, such sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents, popular anger began gradually to storm.
But the most sick topic of principled judges was a program to clean up the Ganges river, with fanfare announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganga - a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often ceases to contain their emotions and moves on to cry.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Somebody poured water from Ganga on the statue of God, and in it were feces - the judge - hot again.
You continue to contaminate the river because they think: Ganges, it will take away all of our sins Gang.
It's the river that we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
Ganga cleaning is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government earlier.
