During a call to 911 teacher confesses murder of girlfriend
During a call to 911 voice almost without shivering lecturer Shannon Lamb told police that shot his girlfriend and that need staff, who would come to their homes.
Lamb stressed that there is a "dog" who is alive, but probably upset, and said that contacts a family member of the deceased can be found in her phone.
Inside the House, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and the note carelessly written by hand on a white sheet of lined paper: "I'm sorry, wish I could have it all back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," reads the note, according to the authorities, signed Lambom.
There is nothing to indicate that Lambe, who ran two online course at Delta State University in Cleveland, Miss., managed by the time to go over 300 miles in the University campus, where, according to the police, he shot all the distinguished history teacher Ethan Schmidt on the eve of his Cabinet.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford reported that University staff learned about the shooting in 10:18 am.
He said that Lambe made the truthful 911 call shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, the victims will prove to be one more: Lambe committed suicide as soon as police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting in the school made students and teachers hide behind locked doors, officials still were trying to fold in one picture the motives which prompted Lamba.
The information shared by investigators at both ends of the State, as well as students and staff members who knew him, helped draw up a portrait of a talented, but perhaps a concerned teacher.
Students were told that they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, reported that it is not allegations of violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included in the book written by Lamba, in which he expressed his appreciation to the "beautiful people" with whom he crossed in my teaching life.
They both taught at the Faculty of social sciences and history, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures both.
At the same time there were some prerequisites of any problems.
One student who is well spoken of Lambe, Brandon Beevers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if to him something was wrong."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamb at the end of the academic year 2014-15 told him about how he struggled with stress.
Lambe earlier asked Delta State University grant him sick leave, saying that he had any health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in University recruitment regulations meant that the doctorate, on getting that worked so persistently Lambe, did not guarantee he would automatically obtain the teaching position.
University President William Laforž said that he knew nothing about the conflict between Lambom and Schmidt, but "obviously, Mr Lamba had something on your mind".
These are questions to which the Lamb is no longer able to answer.
Police attacked the footprint Lamba after his escape from the campus when he was on his way back to the Mississippi River from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, shot gun otdnozarâdnogo of Lamb 38 caliber in the backyard of the House, one mile south of the home of his parents in a suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, reported the Washington County coroner Sweepers Johnson.
His car with the engine running still stood on the driveway.
Nesrazu I could not understand why Lambe arrived in this House, though, according to Johnson, she believed that he knew people who were living in it.
Lamb grew up in those edges.
Lamb started working at the University, which has 3500 students in the city, with a population of about 12000, in 2009 year and taught geography and education.
He received the degree of doctor of pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of the long-time friends Lamba described him as intelligent, charismatic and cheerful person.
Carl Hairston said that she was 15, and Lamba 20 years when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was cool older guy, who for several years tried to teach her to play the guitar.
In those years he enjoyed success with women.
All girls melted when he was near, "said Hairston, now 40 and living in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lambe and Prentiss at the time of the events, apparently, met for some time.
During a call to 911 Lambe said, "I killed my wife", but the record of the registration of their marriage is missing.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gautier in brick house, reverse side which overlooks the Canal.
According to the police, with the dog all right.
Ex-husband Sean Prentiss O'Stin, reported that they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends, and they have a daughter, now 19 years old.
"She is quite depressed," told about O'Stin daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he hasn't met with Lambom, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lambe was interested in music and played the Blues.
Lambe became acquainted with Clinton when he and Abigail both performed at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played occasionally at concerts.
O'Stin told his daughter composes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked for different companies online.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and part-time coordinator of entertainment programs in the dimly lit bar The Julep Room in the suburb of Gautier, said the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss on the evening of 5 September, when Lambe finished playing guitar and harmonica for the few visitors.
Nothing suspicious occurred.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and made one above the other.
In the sense that they were both very witty.
Schmidt, who was a teacher, conducted seminars for freshmen and specialized in the history of native Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, English teacher in the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at the University of Kansas State in Emporia and was President of the student fraternity, and Student Government.
Delta State University campus in Cleveland Tuesday night about 900 people, including university professors, staff, students, and community members participated in a Memorial candle lighting ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the University Choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume Wednesday.
"We try to return our students," said Laforž.
The crisis passed.
Today is a day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Reportage helped prepare Associated Press authors Emily Vagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the statement made by the police that call 911 service entered the Lamba after killing Schmidt, as well as due to the fact that although Lambe and talked about how Prentiss about his wife when the 911 call, reported that they were married, not confirmed.

8 survey results that show that Donald Trump's not kidding
Some tried to hang onto it a shortcut provocateur.
Others shrugged off from it, taking as a joke.
And some require scandal.
But no matter how trying some Republicans shake high position of Donald Trump in the results of the polls, they failed (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trump into the double digits, and some are starting to seriously ask, what does this mean for real estate tycoon in terms of chance of getting the nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to race the Republican party.
Experts pointed out that, at that time in year 2011 Rick Perry conceded its gaining popularity preimŝesvo Hermann Caine, none of whom won and one State in the nominating process.
And there are plenty of reasons why he would fight the general election.
But by external groups, such as "Superkomitet aktinosti" Jeb Bush's political and economic conservative group Club for growth "recognize the relentless force of Trump and begin to get their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some figures that surveys suggest that real estate tycoon-not just the intermediate phase:
Ratings of sympathy for Trump unfolded 180 degrees.
Directly before Donald Trump announced his kandidatstvo in mid-June, Monmouth University poll showed that only two of the 10 Republicans are positively related to the real estate magnate.
By mid-July, it was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 per cent.
Now six of 10 Republicans are positively disposed to Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators prevail in its early stages.
Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of the Republicans there položtel′no belong to Mr. Trump.
Two-thirds voted for the GOP would suit Trump as a candidate.
In a poll conducted by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they had either been treated "with enthusiasm" or "pleased" If Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm, as Trump (43 per cent say they would be treated "with enthusiasm" against 40 percent of those who said the same about Trampe).
The next level of delight?
Marco Rubio, who is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they are "dissatisfied" or "upset" If Jeb Bush establishment favorite to become a candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's temperament problem.
While Trump's massively criticised for his boastfulness and insults, 52 per cent of those who kneel down to Republicans voters across the country think that the magnate suitable temperament to be President, as shown by a poll by ABC News/Washington post survey in Monday.
The same figure appears on the ground from a closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he is the very person who can be the main Commander, according to the Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think he is not the kind of person who can be effective in the post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans voters get used to the idea.
When they put on their hats connoisseurs, Republicans voters think that Trump is seriously.
On the question of who the likely winner of the GOP, four out of 10 said that Trump was the favorite, according to the CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is not so, when four out of 10 put Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters was not proper magical crystal.
At this time last cycle cycle four of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported possible candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, this shows that many voters believe GOP campaign Trump compelling.
Even if Republicans would have rallied around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts suggest that this variation likely plays the Trump advantage, and at the same time do not support Trump's evenly distributed to support more than a dozen other candidates.
But Monmouth University poll conducted in early September showed that in a hypothetical competition "one on one" between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He is ahead of Carly Fiorinu at 13 points, Marco Rubio on 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush on 19 points and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kèsič and Chris Christie on 33 points.
He has a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate which it bypasses?
Ben Carson ahead of businessman for 19 points in a hypothetical competition "one on one".
Slightly more than half of Donald Trump's supporters say that they changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted in Tuesday, shows that only more than half of voters support Trump, say they are confident in their voices.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they are leaving the door open for other candidates.
So n less, most intense competition Trump at the moment-with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have changed their minds, most likely, will choose the Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago immigrants from Mexico called "rapists" in his speech, opening a campaign theme of immigration has become the most urgent conversations in the year 2016.
Some worried that Trump's key voters turn away the posturing of Hispanic origin from the Republican Party and will prevent the rebranding.
But according to the ABC/Post poll, conducted Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump in immigration matters.
Therefore, until the immigration attracted widespread attention, it appears that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Frustrated by the Government is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson is now counting on support from about half of the Republican voters, mainly due to their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new poll Monday ABC/Post claim that they want a political outsider, than a person with experience in Government.
And they are also resentful at Washington.
The Des Moines Register poll/Bloomberg in Iowa, held two weeks ago, shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa disappointed Republicans in Congress activities, while 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "enraged".
The Government will decide the fate of indexation of pensions in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets stated that the Government is now looking for variants of the law concerning pensions indexation in 2016 year at real inflation, passes WP.
She noted that a solution must be found to 8 October, at the time of the introduction of the draft budget for the following year in Government.
In addition, the Cabinet of Ministers is discussing the option of renewal decision on freezing of funded pensions.
Golodets noted, the amount of the pension is equal to 350 billion rubles.

Golodets believes that if the person does not work on their own initiative and does not apply, while the socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not quite true that society pays for it.
Earlier, media reported that the Cabinet of Ministers are considering two options for balancing the State budget.

Jeremy Corbin debuts in a session of questions to the Prime Minister
After the election, Mr. Corbin his debut session of questions to the Prime Minister was expected to eagerly
The new labour party leader Jeremy Corbin soon for the first time to speak at the session of questions to the Prime Minister, for the first time merââs′ with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will perform with the first of six designated issues in the afternoon; for his performance, most likely, will closely watch the press and members of Parliament from the Labor Party.
He called for "less theater and more facts" on a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that may miss some meetings, leaving their colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as head; It happens after assigning them the shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Trades Union Congress in Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the leader of the labour party to stand in silence during the performance of the national anthem at the service Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75 anniversary of the battle of Britain drew criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several advanced articles in newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the national anthem caught the attention of
Press Secretary Mr. Corbin said that he "stood in respectful silence" and recognized "the heroism of the RAF in the battle of Britain".
However, a member of the shadow cabinet, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2, that he would advise labour leader singing the national anthem "irrespective" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow Ministers refused to play as a team, Mr. Corbin, voicing differences on economics, defense and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC'S Robin Brant says that political differences also "garnered pile" in the labour party following the appointment of Mr. Corbin to a post in the European Union and limit Government reimbursements.
Mr. Corbin said at a Conference of the Trades Union, that the Labour Party had amended to abolish the idea of restrictions in General.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Shadow Minister of labor and pension payments, said that the party is "clarity" on account of the fact that she was only in opposition to the plans of the Government to reduce the upper limit from £ 26000 to £ 23000.
Mr. Corbin will become the fifth leader of the Labour Party, with which David Cameron will meet the "courier" for the past ten years since he became leader of the conservative party.
Labor leader who promised a different approach to politics, said that he "drew collective resources" in order to gain ideas questions, Mr. Cameron and received more than 30000 proposals.
Member of Parliament for Islington North County stated that questions the Prime Minister cause unnecessary confrontation, and that it refrain from witty replies and exchanging barbs, instead vowing to focus on serious issues, such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Eagle, Minister of economy in the shadow cabinet, will replace him on issues of Prime minstru, when he will be absent, for example, when Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea to allow other colleagues to take the floor if possible, saying that he had the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
Since becoming leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to get away from political style "exhibition balagana", often associated with the procedure questions to the Prime Minister, but admitted some years later that he could not.
Since the first broadcast in 1990 g. questions the Prime Minister became a key indicator of the views of the leader and their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, though critics argue that this turned into a caricature and requires large-scale reforms.

Metcash launches campaign to "bottom-up approach to combat the onslaught of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its stores IGA from the onslaught of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
Wholesale food supplier launched a grass-roots campaign to protect market share retailers IGA in South Australia and Western Australia in light of the upcoming infusion company Aldi 700 million. dollars.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouse and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, supermarkets and Metcash IGA strengthen relationships with local suppliers of food products and promote the brand through marketing of IGA leading mass media and social networks and events like "Adelaide Show".
The campaign align themselves with retailers and suppliers of IGA, such as ice-cream manufacturer Simmo's from Dunsborough, which offers wine tasting in the IGA stores and store owners who sell discounted tickets for regular customers of the Football League in South Australia.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its strategy for the protection of 29 September-the day when the wholesale supplier of foodstuffs, alcoholic beverages and household goods will hold their annual day investor strategies.
A lot is at stake, as in South Australia and Western Australia stores under the IGA brand accounted for almost 30% of all shops Metcash and show higher profitability than Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South and Western Australia known as adherents of the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for retailers of IGA than those in the States of new South Wales, Victoria and Queensland-more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA, compared to about 14 percent in the Eastern States.

In a report published this week that the Kirtan, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA retailers can lose sales of 360 million dollars per year, while Metcash-250 million dollars by the end of the year 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi next year to open 25 stores in SA and WA-30, sales at 500 million and 600 million dollars in these markets, respectively.
The loss of revenue and sales of food products with a high level of fixed costs Metcash may cost the company about 13 million income before interest and taxes, says Mr. Kirtan.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the Eastern States, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this despite the fact that a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes that the sale of foods Metcash will fall by 3.8 per cent in the year 2016, at 4.1 per cent in the year 2017 and 2.1 per cent in the year 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 per cent in 2015, up 10.3 percent to the year 2020.
Last week a leading Fund Manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "can likely be gone within a decade.
Metcash company refused to publicly comment on the comments of Mr. Douglass.
But it is expected that the Member of the Board of Directors of Metcash contacted Mr. Duglassom last week.
The proportion of IGA in the market declined from 2010 onwards with 18 to 14 per cent, while revenues from Metcash business in the sphere of food, which the company delivers approximately 1200 IGA retailers, fell by 43 per cent compared to the year 2012 as a result of operational deleveridža and because of the pressure on sales figures and profitability.
However, the company is not giving up, spending more than 150 million dollars a year for the sake of equalizing retail prices with prices in Coles and Woolworths thousand positions downloads and helping retailers IGA in the Remaking of trading platforms, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider selection of branded food products.
Metcash ceo Ian Morris said that equalizing the prices and refurbish commercial space is gaining momentum, and hopes that the company will achieve an increase in net profit in the year 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor, rather than criticism for their behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis indirectly suffered in the recent scandal around his friend Nick Kir′osa and for his behavior deserves the honor more than critics, says the President of Tennis Australia Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, Jr. in the talented Duo and often called "Special Ks", unwittingly became the focus of attention because of the shameful brawl with Stan Kir′osa Vavrinkoj Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly thereafter, during the hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, judge on the rig had to twice pull apart Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrisona, while Harrison has stated: "Wawrinka had to stow the blades Kir′osa, and I have to lay on the blades of this guy."
(C) as long as Kokkinakis was last seen lomaûŝim racket after a cramp in his leg saved Richard Gasquet against possible defeat at the US Open, Healy faithfully protects the Kokkinakis case.
The boy is now in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth, for the right to be second after Bernard Tomic in the singles in the Davis Cup semifinals against Great Britain.
"I am keenly worried about one thing, namely that the Tanasi have dragged into the conflict," said Healy.
It really broke the racket when he nullified the leg for the US Open, but he is not the first player who broke a racquet when dashed hopes of Tanasi, and I know well enough to be sure that he would not be proud.
But in fact he had a very good in pretty provocative situations to US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he can be trusted.
It is surrounded by a great team, he has a wonderful family, and I just think that it came a bit dishonest.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works hard, fits perfectly into the team, he never had problems with other players, he is respected off the Court, he trains intensively, he's in great shape, he's very goal-oriented and well-developed young man, and I think that it should be appreciated.
Healey also supported the decision to forgive for the sake of Kir′osa important match starting Friday in the belief of "mutual consent", the correct output for all, but expecting that guy from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term player.
"First and foremost we want a team fully focused on the match and not on disputes around [Kir′osa]," said Healy.
And I think that Nick gained strength very quickly, that proves people like Federer and Marrèâ, it grows in the eyes of the public, he made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to help him understand the consequences of their actions, and should, I believe, take it out of the center of attention for a while so he could reflect on them and this is the best thing for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, delaying migrants
Declaring a State of emergency, in Hungary Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia to the southern border and detain those who try to sneak into the country illegally to keep pouring inside the flow of migrants.
Riots took place at the border-hundreds of migrants stranded in the border area, which Serb authorities reacted negatively.
Stuck indefinitely on a stretch of road between checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing violence in their homeland, pitched tents and settled on this area.
However, discontent grew.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, migrant shouting "open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian police.
Some in protest, refusing food and water.
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared "unacceptable" the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, when more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, rather than collateral damage.
You must in the coming days to negotiate with Brussels and other countries, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Unrest in the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after block of 28 countries had been unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to assume overall responsibility for 40000 people seeking asylum in Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future (in the next month or by the end of the year) is reached, according to which Member States of the European Union will take another 120 000000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and in Austria Tuesday demanded gather next week an emergency EU Summit to discuss the immigration crisis that engulfed the continent.
Hungary, however, doesn't expect quick action on the part of Brussels or neighbors.
Declared in a State of emergency Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers for action on the crisis, enabling them to block the roads and speed up court cases for asylum.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Minister of Hungary Peter Sijârto said that his country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence on the border with Romania, to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that she has finished the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were connected to urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and the border crossing point of the European Union for displaced persons, many of whom are refugees-victims of war in Syria and the Middle East.
However, the country's Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisting that most people arriving in the country were economic migrants seeking a better life rather than refugee victims of the hostilities that have the right to be protected, and this view is sharply at odds with the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws entered into force in Hungary at midnight, consider now the intersection of crime or damage 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence, built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison sentences for perpetrators of offences involving traffic in persons.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares a State of emergency," Government spokesman told reporters Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged.
We clearly give illegal crossing of the border understand that offense.
Formally, the Parliament still must approve the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters, who are already on the border within a few days of watching there the presence of heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's national security adviser, announced the capture of authorized bodies of 45 people who tried to cross the border, on the border, and another 15 people inside the country.
They crossed the border, breaking a fence, are currently in the custody of police and charged with committing administrative violations by the new laws.
Authorities quickly restore the fence.
The Hungarian authorities in Tuesday morning also shut down two of the seven passes on the border with Serbia, prignav to block one of the passages railway wagon, coiled barbed wire.
Rioting erupted at the main passage across the border near the town of R′oske (Hungary), as the Hungarians placed premises to skip people inside a metal container, and a crowd of people pressed each other to break inside.
Get inside managed approximately 20 persons, while thousands of people were left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary, and announced the refusal of food and water until they are missing in Hungary.
The election of 2016: Advantage Hillary Clinton over Bernard Sanders has been halved in national poll
Former us Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit advantage in the race for the nomination, Democrats across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders it catches up.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among primary voters-Democrats (down 58 per cent), and Sanders comes second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to participate in the presidential race, 15 percent supported primary voters-Democrats.
For more than five months before the start of competition at the primary elections most voters-Democrats say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate, which will support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in their choice than podderžvaûŝie other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders made some bonuses.
Clinton holds a big advantage among women and moderates, but this advantage was reduced.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders behind her total for 5 points.
The preference for Clinton voters Democrats up to 50 years, disappeared, and they with Sanders now on an equal footing.
But Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month Clinton was leaving behind bunches of Sanders at a two-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 items in this group.
Nearly half of the primary voters-Democrats across the country say they enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the nominee of the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she's a candidate.
Six percent did not support it.
Perhaps it is not surprising that the current Clinton supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm at its expense.
Among those, who does not currently support Clinton, looks more contradictory-only about a quarter of its enthusiastically supported.
While 48 percent of primary voters-Democrats say they'd enthusiastically supported Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about its leader, Donald Trampe (35 per cent).
When supporters of Clinton set an open question why they want to see its candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 per cent), then it is time women (13 per cent), and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 per cent).
Clinton supporters also say about the Association, linking it with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
Also known as soglasne on and the chances of election.
Since Vice President ponders the potential vote, 57 percent of primary voters-Democrats would like to join the race-while a third considers that he should not.
When asked whom they would like to see in second place among candidates from the party, primary voters-Democrats in most cases referred to Biden.
Among the supporters of Clinton more than half said that they'd chosen Biden second, it's more than Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to stand as a candidate of the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton advantage over Sanders would increase from 20 points to Biden among the participants of the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of the voters Democrats see Clinton the candidate with the best chance of winning in the general election; However, this figure declined from 78 percent in the past month.
By this measure, Biden with a large backlog in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate, has increased.
However, answering the question, what is most important in a candidate, voters-Democrats choose other options in addition to the chance to be elected.
Similar to the situation in the past month, none of the candidates or potential candidates from the Democrats is not a nepriemlimym nominee for these primary voters.
Democrats candidates, or potential candidates, showed good results on some key characteristics among primary voters from his party.
The majority believes Clinton, Sanders and Biden honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden from all three leads on honesty and strength of Clinton in its leadership.
Thirty percent of primary voters-Democrats do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who said the same about Sanderse (15 per cent), but 27 percent have no opinion about him on this account.
Primary voters-Democrats also generally believe similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden.
On all these standards, about a quarter of the electorate-Democrats don't have any opinion about Sanderse.
Although questions about personal email and server at Hillary Clinton as her Secretary of State continues, the majority of primary voters-Democrats satisfied her explanation in that regard and considered that it did not influence negatively on their overall opinion about it.
But that's another story altogether at the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today dissatisfied with her explanation, but met only about a third.
Public opinion was divided about this back in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy over the e-mails did not affect their opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion on it.
Basically it is the Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who argue that their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even as Clinton considered fair and credible voters from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in General: only 32 percent consider it to be honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than the previous month, and compared to May 15.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters did not consider her honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not believe Trump honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, get good grades for leadership qualities.
Of the six tested candidates Biden, Carson and Bush showed the best result on honesty.
Most see Sanderse rather honest person than no, but how about Carson, many do not have no opinion about him.
The limit of error for the sample of 351 primary voters-Democrats is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of a national survey of Ben Carson approached Donald Trump
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the last survey, CBS/New York Times
These two candidates scored half of voters in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of the supports under the feet
Republicans voters across the country continue to massively support Trump's, the percentage whose support has increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll, held on the eve of a debate on Fox News last month, up to 27% in the survey conducted in Tuesday.
But Carson took off during the same period from 6% to 23%.
The poll also showed that Carson has the support of all demographic groups, surpassing the Trump group Republican voters with higher education.
Other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fioriny and the Governor of Ohio, John Kasiča, rolled back along with the Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10% in the past month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator from Florida Marco Rubio together occupy third place with 6%.
The limit of error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6%, the survey was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll, published last week, showed growth of Carson in the polls-demonstrating support for 19% among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The last poll by ABC News/Washington Post also revealed that Trump outstrips Carson.
With the increasing support Carson last week, Trump made a few critical attacks against former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning the faith of Trump.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the close of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused in the death of Baruch College freshman
Approximately two years after the death of a college student during the ritual initiation into the fraternity in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania charged with murder was brought against five people.
"The members of the fraternity Pi Delta Psi from New York Baruch College savagely attacked Chan" Michael "Deng during the initiation ceremony in September 2013, and not brought him to the hospital in time, causing his death," police said.
Officials say that the student is blindfolded and 30-funtovym rucksack gritty behind several times pushed until he tried to achieve the goal, walking on slippery surfaces.
Mr Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the brotherhood of Delta PI Psi did not call 911, when Deng lost consciousness, and waited another hour before allegedly to deliver him to the hospital, police say.
They are, however, taking the time to change clothes Deng, found in Google his symptoms and contact with Andy ', National President of the fraternity, to ask for advice, as told at the press conference, police chief Chris Wagner.
"At this point, the members of the brotherhood began to hide personal assets, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity above health Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
Could not save him and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received some blunt trauma of the head, torso and hips.
"Too many families have suffered as a result of initiation rituals in the brotherhood, because at least one student die during them every year since 1970," Douglas said in a statement Fajerberg, the lawyer representing the family of Deng.
The fraternity and its members must be held accountable, and this move by the authorities is very important.
Monroe County jury chose in favor of third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including m-RA Menga, will have the charge of violence against a newcomer and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to bring to justice not only individual members, but if there is an organization, which authorized all this formally or informally, and then her," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and National Brotherhood excluded from their local branch structure.
What will happen when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates
Happen to hike rates, and "bull market" stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy fall into recession.
This we know.
What we don't know, so this is how much time will pass before the onset, and how long it will last.
Specifically for the economy story that explains a little about time.
Recession occurred just 11 months after first raising rates and integer 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, though not always, determines the reaction of economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the administration of the Central Bank of the United States so insistent that investors should not focus on when it would begin to raise rates, and on how many take adaptation.
In fact, many variables in play.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the whole fuss around raising rates turns out to be exaggerated.
"The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of cheap money," said Julian Jessop, Chief International Economics specialist at Capital Economics, in its commentary to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to more normal, but still low levels will be seismic impulse, which many fear.
This does not mean, however, that the effects would not be.
Here's a look at how to respond to certain areas of the economy, depending on historical trends:
As we have already seen the market over the last month or so, waiting for rate hikes could lead to volatility for some time.
When you raise the stakes, however, the consequences are usually not such dramatic.
"Unlike that income from shares slowed down to 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the results of Federal Reserve rate hikes.
Specifically, the market for the past 35 years often changes dramatically — about 14 percent-higher rates remained fairly flat during 250 days thereafter (average growth of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal with an average yield of 14.4 percent over the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob Dollom, Chief specialist of the stock trading strategy in Nuveen Asset Management published in Barron's.
Deutsche say that result for securities tends to not immediately become more pronounced at the stage of raising rates, and the income from the shares begin to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but raising the stakes often play them contribute.
In this case, the Federal Reserve put in conditions that did not exist before and can accelerate a recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be nearly its lowest point during the existence of high rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases with rates povyšenâ 1950 year only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 per cent.
Even though in the second quarter of the year 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few believe that it's here to stay, despite the fact that in the third quarter, he stays at the level of just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising the rates on such volatile economic background can be risky and poses the question "will this time differently," Deutsche said.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates by the Federal Reserve all year, while their opinion is chained to a meeting of the Federal open market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many experts on strategies and economists believe that the FOMC might approve the increase rates at this meeting, says futures trading on just 25 per cent probability.
"In our study from 1950 onwards all cycles increases until today were in the supercikle increasing financial leverage with the GDP, overlapping peaks, preceding a recession very quickly after the start of the recovery," the report says.
In contrast, it was extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
Current loop at this point-the longest, which the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record stood at 35 months, only it lasts 74 months and have not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market expects an increase in the rates, and this script in some way similar to the one implemented for the stock.
The main difference is that in effect for bonds comes faster than for stocks when the federal system changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that yield vector changes immediately after the first increase/decrease the rates in a loop.
At the end of the cycle, improve yields rates immediately falls ", Deutsche.
Strategy specialists from Charles Schwab believes that raising the rates will lead to profitability levels of long-term and short-term bonds will draw together, making the curve flatter.
Bonds with high returns often behave better in such a climate, although "we still fear of fluctuations in profitability," study says Katie Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the policy of the federal system.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market and became one the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans climbed, the yield curve of more flat, credit spreads widened, volatility rose-all characteristics of the market policy tightened federal system.
Generally speaking, companies engaged in the main its business in United States, will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with lots of debt would be in a worse situation because growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global marketplace, and their debt more expensive-in the financial sector.
"History shows that the" quality "of the action demonstrated the effectiveness of the above market within three months after the initial increase in rates," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Company with stable financial state of the company's precarious state bypassed by results of each increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 year, an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as shares with low volatility also showed better performance than low-quality stocks, on average, 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt is a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of debt with floating rate will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to the stock exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the increasing dollar.
Investors could see profits through higher profitability, although experts differ on how fast it happens.
"BBC Radio 3-a copy of Classic FM," conservative member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "lowering standards"
Proves that it is becoming less distinct from commercial competitor
Also set his sights on BBC Music Awards, saying that the award just peeled off with Brits
Parliament colleague Damien Collins hit on The Voice with the same criticism was not original
"BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM", stated the leader of members of Parliament, prompting the company to prove that she was doing anything, don't do commercial companies.
Conservative Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham also said the leadership of the BBC, that it seems as if public radio station "glupeet" and is becoming less distinct from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems-I don't like to use the word" simplify "-but it seems like it turns into Classic FM," he said.
He also set his sights on the prize BBC Music Awards, started last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different-here are two examples of that first came to my mind, where you actually just copy something that already exists on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC HAS denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and education audience.
What do I know thanks to Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performances and music creation actually can not be compared more with anyone.
Also really is very important, I think the interest of Radio 3 in search of new music and in promoting new works, "he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Manager Alan Davie claimed that radio stations have to work much harder to attract an audience than in the past because the Brits are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not only the brainchild of the BBC, which has been under attack for the strike on the heels of commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on culture, media and sport.
Tory member of Parliament Damian Collins attacked The Voice-music talent show, that the BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media for an indicative price at 22 million pounds.
See why this program is often discussed in connection with the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall argues that the BBC 1 show, in which the judges involved Paloma Faith and Boy George, was done in "the typical style of the BBC".
He added that he wants from the Corporation to "found a hit in your own home stables" next time it will run the entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to impede the request new seasons of The Voice or the use of money in the future those who pay a license fee to other entertainment formats.
Maximize Internet sales growth slowed in August, and the reason may be Black Friday
In the first three months of the year 2015, there has been an increase in online sales by seven percent
Last month, had the slowest growth since for him began to watch in 2000 year
Online sales three years ago have intensified through the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that the November Black Friday could help deter Trat
For about ten years, virtual shopping is experiencing a boom, turning many Central streets in Britain in ghost towns.
But experts say that now there are signs of aligning online sales after recent data showed only a semiprocentnoe increase in the first three months of the year 2015.
Total expenditure on online shopping in August demonstrated minimal growth since they began to record in the year 2000, having increased by only five percent.
Experts say that now there are signs of aligning online sales after recent data showed only a semiprocentnoe increase in the first three months of the year 2015
"If you look at the growth rates in previous years and will return back to 2000 g, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Mulcahy sales index editor IMRG.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers began to use their cell phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they can do it in any context, for example, sitting on a couch.
But now it is on a plateau, and you can see the decrease (growth).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which came from America, referred to as one of the reasons for the slowing sales.
Experts suggest that buyers could refrain from shopping on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, shoppers in the amount of five times the average hurried to computers to take advantage of great offers, thereby unleashing a series of websites of sellers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers come into a real battle for advantageous purchases could compel people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over £ 1 out of every 5 is spent online.
With regard to goods such as televisions and washing machines, more than one-third of them sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online are more likely than in trendy shops on main streets.

In General, half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of decisions on purchased goods are taken by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laurie-one of the five women at the helm of the uk's leading companies, whose shares are recorded in the FTSE100 index, also changed the team top-managers, among the directors of an equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher-almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the ceo and CFO.
Ms. Lori said: "it was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Find suitable women to the Board of Directors was easy.
After the Group took responsibility for the closure of the shops, the company Kingfisher showed lower profits and sales volumes for six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the brands Screwfix and B&Q opens new stores 200
A decision on the interest rate the Federal Reserve United States
The world is watching because of Federal Reserve Bank meeting, where for two days discussed the adoption of essential decisions-raise or no interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists carried out by Reuters, found that slightly more than half of those who last week believed that the Federal Reserve will now believe that he still will hold over the combing and will retain the rate at the current range of 0-0, 25 percent.
This is a historic event, because it is now seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
The first time we come to what the Central Bank might move to zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics.
United States economy works efficiently, economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve could not ignore how the decision will affect the world economy.
He warned markets that should prepare for the changes, but all said their confidence that all the odds are against such a move.
The decision will be announced in Thursday at 20.00 CET.
New Balkan route: refugees are coming into the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" chant, hundreds of refugees at a checkpoint at Horgoš Serbo-Hungarian border.
From Budapest Tuesday blocked the border for displaced persons.
Asylum-seekers are already beginning to sound out other options for routes into the EU.
One of them, bypassing a closed border with Serbia is through Romania.
Another through Croatia and Slovenia-Austria.
According to some reports, the buses that transported refugees from Serbia to Hungary, now go to town on the Croatian border Shiddo.
Drivers got an order from authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovich assured that his country was doing its utmost to help refugees, but its options are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, to ensure humane treatment.
But this is a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve, no country in Europe alone can not cope with it, and the more such a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest open border for refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is adamant:
If someone do a refugee in Serbia it must fill in necessary documents.
And if he doesn't do it, and our country would not enter it because Serbia is quite safe.
Hungary already has built 175-tikilometrovyj fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban is not going to stop there: he plans to erect the same barrier on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Mejmarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Mejmarakis over the years was in the center-right government, which led, in the view of the left, the country into financial crisis.
Now he's becoming temporary leader of the party of new democracy, a challenge to Ciprasu.
A few days before the elections, he met with Euronews journalist.
Euronews: Mr Mejmarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Mejmarakis: thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: nine months ago your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing Coalition syriza, but now, judging by polls, "new democracy" sharing it with her popularity.
That changed during this time?
Vangelis Mejmarakis: Greece has changed, and we do too.
Mr Tsipras much lied in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and growth prospects.
Now the country again, the budget deficit and high unemployment.
Investors are gone, because Mr Tsipras chased them.
During the past nine months, the Greeks had an opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and false promises of Mr Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare promised that actually happened.
Daily life has become noticeably worse than in January, when the situation improved, and it concerned the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that in case of victory at the polls will seek alliances with other parties, including SIRIZu.
Vangelis Mejmarakis: the fact of the matter is that, as we have learned in recent years, Greece could not move forward without the understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where have acted or still active programs to rescue the political forces and all ruling parties gathered together to implement a program in which they agree, without renouncing their political or ideological autonomy.
This is why I firmly believe that only cooperation at the current stage of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Ciprasom and the country's creditors.
If you become a new Prime Minister Monday, will you implement that agreement, or try to change it, at least partly?
Vangelis Mejmarakis: actually, we voted in favour of the motion of Greece in the European way, because well, what disastrous consequences would lead the graduation of a country from the EU.
Now Europe helps us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have the solidarity funds, Juncker package and aid in the banking sector.
All of this would be lost if it were not for the Treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of how Mr Tsipras negotiated.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government during its first year in power wants to bring order, acts efficiently and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then, I am sure, all commitments that cannot be met due to the fact that lead to a recession, can again be the subject of negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that already in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to come back to negotiations with our lenders, because they expect the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their confidence, we need to continue privatization, reform and structural changes that were agreed upon, continuing to benefit from EU funding and large investment opportunities, which we must open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government has not provided any serious Tsipras arguments on many of the key political issues, what we learned, discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
Can give an example, associated with the income of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that we are not talking about a fixed monthly income, and therefore he could not fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Ministers never Tsipras said.
That is, the Greek Ministers were not prepared and ill-informed, and therefore unsuccessfully negotiated and concluded an agreement failed.
Euronews: If you win the election, then soon you will find yourself at a table with Mr Juncker, Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will there be different what you tell them, tell them that your predecessor, Antonis Samaras?
Vangelis Mejmarakis: first of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014 years we tried to best implement 2012 year, bypassing it in sharp corners.
We promoted reform forward.
Of course we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we were acting in an emergency.
The market fell, and it was not the potential buyers willing to pay the price, arranging the Greek Government.
At the time I was the speaker of Parliament, I was able to reconcile the views of three parliamentary groups, which was then a government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working Parliament, and it is in the presence of the populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations were held outside.
And we managed to bring the country to normality, which would continue to improve, if the process has not been interrupted early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: Last week on Greek territory is moving a massive flow of refugees.
What do you think about this situation, and the reaction of European countries that aspire to these people?
Vangelis Mejmarakis: refugee crisis is a time bomb, with which we must deal after winning the election.
And the reason is that the Government has not acted SYRIZA in this situation, as it should.
In such matters should stay ahead of the curve, because if the problem gives you, there remain only emergency measures.
And we are now in this situation.
Even the interim Government, which replaced SIRIZu, made just seven days more than Mr Tsipras made for seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim Government, which has provided valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, which hold the EU Summit, will find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country and note-refugees are illegal immigrants.
It is the victims of war in Syria, victims of any extraordinary events with them.
This issue has deeply humanitarian aspect, and we will stick to the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
Appropriate decision should be taken at the EU Summit, should be involved and the United Nations.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and refugee reception centres.
We also need to effectively use the economic assistance that we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mr Mejmarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Mejmarakis: thank you.

After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi Monday morning-before he shot and killed his colleague later that same day-Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he "regrets" about the first murder and wishes to "all back," said authorities in Tuesday.
Police in the town of Gautier, Miss., said that a teacher of geography and social sciences at the University of the Delta, called the 911 service about 10:00 am.
in Monday and reported that he had shot someone.
Lambe said the Dispatcher that police need to send people to his home.
He said: "last night I killed my wife", and also mentioned that the House is "dog" that "nobody will touch", but probably upset.
Police asked the name of the caller, but he did not name.
Lambe has not explained why he opened fire.
Arriving at the crime scene, police found a body there Amy Prentiss 41 year and written by hand a note from Lamba, 45 years, stating: "I'm sorry, I would like to return everything back.

The stars have lost their luck
Actor (left), photos with his son Redmond (right), have gone through some difficult years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing companion Farr Fawcett, dying of cancer.
The actor reportedly also suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this undoubtedly played a role.
Hatch show from Manchester United was eliminated for several months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a match of the Champions League, where Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the Defender is experiencing in this regard, which will not be able to get out on the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that the show will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during the reckless tackles Hector Moreno on 15 minutes when 20-year-old burst into the box Show zone of PSV.
He assisted on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken away to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "he had a double fracture, and he is in hospital."
It will be taken to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then undergoing an operation.
It is awful-a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18 years, overcame great difficulties and was playing fantastically, and then this happened.
It was in the locker room at the oxygen mask.
He cried.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it is for six months, and the guy will not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he will be able to play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he hadn't received a red card and a penalty has not been assigned.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli was not chastised Mexican.
Van Gaal believes that Italian judge erred.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad tackle with two legs.
In his Twitter Shaw wrote: "thank you all for your messages, words cannot describe how I devastated my road to recovery begins, I will come back even stronger than it was."
On another topic: Manchester United experiencing misfortune with Hatch Show if the game with PSV
The defender of Englishmen will be an additional incentive to put on for the European Championships in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "this is a very severe injury".
When any player is eliminated with a similar injury, all are very upset by this.
It was never the intention of our players is hurting the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against a team led by van Gaal of Holland at the World Cup, 2014.
"It is now very difficult because he had no intent to injure an opponent, and when you hear that this is a very severe injury, you feel bad," said Cocu.
I have not had the opportunity to see the very moment.
The only thing I can see is the ball flying in the other direction, so that it looked as if he (Moreno) touched it, but I haven't seen a Strip under the hatch.
In a conversation with the SBS6 Moreno said: "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to endure.
Me very hard, and I'm sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smollingom.
David Cameron know about "Lorakse" something else?
Each parent very quickly learns one thing: If your child liked any book, take a little time before the vybudete knowing it almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
Replying to the representative of the company engaged in the Organization of children's rest in vacation, about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Dr. Seuss"-a tale of environmental bias, written by Dr. S′ûzom in the year 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in comments published on the website of the company SuperCamps, and continues: "This funny, touching, unusual history with a strong message I love to read to your kids, because it always detects any image or message, which we miss."
And everything would be fine, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to be paraphrased contents of books, but actually tells the story of the eponymous film, made in the year 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify rather short original narration.
"Surrounded by high walls the city of Vsemnužvill′, where there was no greenery, and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of your dream girl Audrey, her desire is to see the real tree," we read in the text description of the love story, unknown to Dr. S′ûzu (real name Theodor Seuss Gejzel′), deceased in the year 1991.
If it looks suspicious, not enough text to read Cameron almost as a summary of the plot of the film "Dr. Seuss", uploaded on the website of the Internet Movie Database: "surrounded by high walls the city of Vsemnužvill′, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey-girls of their dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, admittedly, an active parent, so unfamiliar with the content of the book, which is not named for the boy learns about how destroying surrounding Wednesday greedy vyrubŝik trees and vâzal′ŝik "vsemnužek" Nahodkins, despite the protests of Loraksa (whose name is pronounced in the name of the book)-funny creatures with whiskers, which "speaks on behalf of the trees".
Most likely, this simple PR task was entrusted to the perpetrator, never read a book about child Loraksa 20 times in a row.
The Downing Street spokesman said that the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's constituency office.
Company SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron, but there was no further comment.
For Adam Lita clearly there was a risk of not getting into the England national team, but it is still a difficult question
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England has selected for this tour, the repetition of the defeat in the test series with a score of 3-0, what happened last time, seems likely.
I would also not rule out a victory in his field.
Team Alistair Cook, perhaps less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but among players are batsmen, masterly host twisted balls, and collective thinking strongly; they will bring no scars from 2012 onwards, only youth positive.
The ball turns into the bowler Ali Moen making twisted balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure to test level, is an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lit out of England's test cricket and replaced by Alex Hejlzom
The decision to expel Adam Lita me, his head coach in "Yorkshire", of course, difficult to analyze.
In his seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and obvious, but the harsh reality is that cricketers are evaluated by judges on outcome.
There were no questions on John Ruth, for example, that led to this announcement, because (and I've said this before) the best players choose themselves.
The couple, and LITA numbering half hundred could wait longer career, but he was at the mercy of their own destiny.
We hope that if he gains more earned run average for the "Yorkshire", you will see another possibility.
England coach, Trevor Bayliss, well spoken about his attitude, even when he didn't show what is capable, and it does not surprise me; It is first and foremost a team player, and then everything else.
The question is, how long it will be before test cricket batsman will leave an impression about himself is a complex issue.
LITA played in seven games, as Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton-nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his and on another field.
The only thing you could complain that England chose Jonathan Trotta for Caribbean Premier League, when Lita was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity has already in the past.
Alex appears Hèjls, and he bètsman, which I appreciate greatly.
It's an unpredictable kriketist that we have seen in Jorkširskom Club earlier this season when he scored 236 in the match against us at the site of the Trent Bridge that was already something.
It should at least be given the same opportunity as those who came before him, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the U.A.E..
The thought put Moena beside Cook in as an opening batsman, that would make it possible to introduce an additional spinner, retaining four high-speed boulerov, reflection, and I'm not against that.
Don't see any reason why the batter a player may not hit the ball there, and the lefty has already shown that he is a damn good kriketist.
Moen, perhaps not exactly what you need for your Worcestershire County, but became the third number for them and a big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches "the third batsman," before you go in as an opening in the year 2001.
He won three hundred immediately and haven't looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the squad as reserve spinner, and in my brief dealings with him it seemed to me very promising young man.
People can look at his rough stats on average 31 with the bat and ball 35-and think that this is a risky bet, but spinner crowns casting a bit and discharging to selected youth.
He had much to learn in this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to coaching staff.
Mahely assignment Džajauordina, Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches, would be a master stroke.
He's one of the best guys to play, which brings her wealth of experience in all the possible conditions and in any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games, where the white ball, and will provide both energy and merciless pace Setup.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether playing or coaching, and as Mahela, has considerable intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has been said previously, may give new strength to the team.
Colleague Collie Durham teammate Ben Stokes left to rue the short-lived granted a similar break for Australia, and I, for one, do not feel about this problem.
While not everyone will agree, trainers and those discharging to the players, do not define a schedule.
And you must remember, as the players, their positions depend on results.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
Camp release of the Uk from the European Union can prevail if the economy is in a depression to the year 2017
Ill-conceived policy of David Cameron on the resumption of negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU every day is more difficult, even without regard to the election of the brilliant Jeremy-"is it yes or no?" -Corbin labour leader or outrage the TUC about Europe in Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbin and Najdžely-Farargi.
User-friendly European diplomat explained the other day that when the position is now the EU, facing various crises-not all of them own manufacturing-some participating countries are fed up with British self-centered divisive agenda concessions and undermining the agreement changes, which they mostly don't want to.
Gathered in Brighton for its annual meeting, the TUC decided that he didn't want them anyway if they are destroying social security.
We could even call it a "program of selfi Dave and George."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance on the summits and bilateral Skate sessions in foreign capitals, photographed themselves against the backdrop of the famous local monument companies local celebrities or without it, then come home and say that they attract allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European PAL who wants interested in maintaining external contacts Britain under an awning of the EU-"don't leave us, together with France," said Berlin offers to zašorennye Ministers and officials in some capitals reached the understanding, when they will be anyway, stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, very cautious-ally, but it has been in Office for 10 years and wants to leave the Cabinet before the situation deteriorates, for her as she deteriorated for early marriages who stay in its place Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrana (14) and Kohl's (16).
The head of France Francois Hollande faces a re-run or replacement in the year 2017.
It also expires.
Poland may soon get nationalistic right-wing Government, Spain-left.
It is hard to see them lezuŝimi out of his help to "selfi-britam", whose energy could be spent to prevent Scotland from the uk-what they don't want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these Ministers can even schedule issuing deliberately unhelpful remarks in the style of the SNP during the referendum campaign in the uk in the year 2017, to hasten the exit of the Uk from the EU, suggests my friend.
"The revision was the idea-fix" and "Britain has not received anything of value from a resumption of negotiations."
Europeans on their trouble know how predators can be Fleet Street and as skeptical toward the EU configured media magnates, unlike the times zapuŝenogo Tony Benn referendum in 1975, which supported our accession 1973 year ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, hardcore Euro-opportunista, famous for his "straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90 's.
For all its stupidity Ed Milliband knew who his enemies.
They included a motley company of tax Crooks, who are wary of phone hackers-strangers and pseudo-non-residents, who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair was about them quite the same opinion, but was aware that when you are in the cage with the lush Gorilla, you have to hand it to her plantains to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
On the fact of Millibènd was more partisan than Blair, Blair in opposition to the idea of Cameron about the referendum because Blair postupilsâ principles in favor of aborted EU Constitution buried French and Dutch voters in 2005 year, who issued him a winning ticket.
Press anything from it he was not forgiven.
But milâga Jeremy Corbin, who befriend patted me on the back in Westminster in Monday-I told him that he had no more time to waste it on me-it looks like the risk of repeat strategy the Nile Kinnock "boycott Murdoch from the 80 's-error and then and now.
It may take time, but it should develop a coherent strategy for interaction with the press-not with me, but definitely with Andrew Marrom whose couch he was sitting in air force Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I call èvolûcionirovaniem gently.
He said he would like to see we stayed in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside of the tradiocinalistskoj trend Ukip and a wider range of "low" among England supporters the Tories might say "Yes".
This is the same thing that Hilary Benn "-but not" bennit-Benn said on radio and television this week, with his inner boy scout flat-out refused to accept that the appointment of his terrible Corbin John Mcdonnell "shadow" Finance Minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70 's, when his old father struggles fought on tv for disloyalty to the colleagues in the lejboristskomu Cabinet, without going too far and not losing his post in the Cabinet.
Battle of Hilary was more attractive.
But struggle to stay "under any circumstances"-a phrase Benn-not something that spoke to Mcdonnell, and not something that J. K. told peers and members of Parliament at a private meeting in Monday evening, according to general opinion.
That neither wanted to let a Democrat and "his guy" Corbin-remember he touched even me-discipline remains an important messages in an age of 24-hour television 7 days a week, and especially in the vortex of social networking, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
This is reasonable-not give Cameron so just get rid of Europe, allowing him to take for granted the support of the labour party during the referendum campaign, Mcdonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the main misconception Mcdonnell and Corbin about membership in the EU-in the context of the "bennitskoj" economy beleaguered fortress-is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among leftist dissidents, for whom narcissism created by minor honours, is a central principle in a dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his misconceptions about Nato-Tom Watson unmoved that j. k. will not agitate for secession-foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey it to their leaders at home.
Why Paris or Berlin spending political capital-they too have suspicious voters-concessions to Britain, where everything can be pointless?
United States already very disappointed by weak British military action in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory Government in power cuts costs, as I was reminded in Monday during lunch at a forum entitled British Influence Security.
Experts have criticized the review of the electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
Statement by the Government-funded agency that e-cigarettes at 95% less harmful than smoking, were announced at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom were associated with the tobacco industry, as researchers reported.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), in conjunction with the Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Public Health Agency of England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published an important report-"rotary" milestone last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and said some experts link with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal the Lancet last month criticized "extremely shaky argument", on the basis of which the PHE built its main conclusion.
BMJ article even two researchers have wondered whether these statements under a "solid or flimsy grounds".
Martin Mckee, Professor of European public health organizations at the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine, and Simon Kèjpvell, Professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, reported: "the fundamental principle of health-rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
According to them, the public expects that statements by PHE that "current best estimate indicates that e-cigarettes by about 95% less harmful than tobacco" were based on the detailed parsing of evidence and modeling.
In fact, it is inferred from the only meeting 12 people gathered for mul′tikriterial′nogo analysis of decision-making in order to summarize their opinions about the harm associated with various nikotinosoderžaŝimi products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Kejpvell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, on Director General reported that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for the independent study.
He also confirmed the BAT certificates in health care in the sustainability report.
One of 12 people at a meeting announced financing from manufacturers of electronic cigarettes, not mentioning that financing, which he previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
Reasonable explanation for the selection board members was not given, but among them there are several prominent supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which are also indicated on the financing of the publication industry.
It is unknown whether the other participants of the meeting management experience in the tobacco case.
The meeting also visited Chief tobacco directions in PHE.
Scientific article published by the group, "gracefully accepts" that there was a lack of "solid evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria," wrote Mackey and Kèjpvell.
However, none of these relationships, and constraints were not affected by the report PHE.
McKee and Kèjpvell told that the statements of PHE, that "at present there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, causing children or non-smokers to smoke" are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being in the PHE, said that the statements of the BMJ were earlier answers.
He told: "electronic cigarettes much less harmful than smoking".
One of the two lifetime nonsmokers died from his addictions.
All the evidence suggest that health risks from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term consequences.
U PHE has a clear duty to inform the public that prove and what not to prove the evidence, especially where the public had doubts about the relative risk compared to tobacco.
About 80000 people a year die from diseases related to smoking, and smoking is costing the NHS in 2 billion pounds a year.
Clearly identifying the obvious-that while electronic cigarettes and are not safe, they are only part of the damage smoking-we perform our tasks for the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 finds that the BBC should stop tv series EastEnders
The former head of Channel 4, Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop production of programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noticing that their competitors in business a lot would be sacrificed for such successful shows as soap opera "Albert Square".
Johnson noticed that licence fees should only be used to create such programs, which are not produced in other British television and radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for what company makes the transfer of public broadcasting, which certainly looks only a small part of the audience, on peak airtime when competitors come highly rated show and on such channels as BBC4.
After BBC Director Tony Hall said that the Corporation would collaborate more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he at one time for a period of six years, unsuccessfully attempted to establish cooperation with the BBC while working on Channel 4.
"I can't help thinking that the BBC is preparing to launch and the broadcasts that could show competing companies not receiving subsidies," Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee under the clarification of the fate of the BBC.
If you save the license fee that I don't believe a good solution in the medium and long term, the company should leave the airwaves only those programs that are not available and are not going to be produced by other companies.
Show The Voice aired in primetime slot, because the creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else it didn't show, hilarious and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to finance broadcasts that could be sponsored by without subsidy.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; It is well known that they own production.
Other channels will surely be a lot for it gave.
I don't understand how this can be a public broadcasting.
I do not think that this somehow would diminish the BBC.
A serial entrepreneur who headed the Channel channel Johnson with 4 2004 to 2010 year, accused the BBC quest for ratings "due to the ambitions of employees and because of their belief that this is the best way to get support for a long time."
His comments on the most popular show on the BBC coincided with comments by the Executive Director of Sky Toney Boll, who in his lecture to the memory of MakTaggarta in Edinburgh in 2003 year, invited by the BBC to sell tv series EastEnders type.
Johnson noticed that more niche BBC transmission of a public nature "continue to go on BBC4, where often it is impossible to estimate the audience, but the company's function is executed, and it can be presented as an argument in the hanžeskih sermons, warranting the income from licence fees in 4 billion. lb: "well, Yes, of course, we do all these weird that no one is watching."
They put them into the slot, where no one will never watch them.
About the license fee Johnson told the Committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system with regard to who will get the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year-a huge amount, but for people for whom 150 pounds-big money, I wonder, are they so believe because they are not watching and listening to the BBC.
Former Executive Director of Sky channels and Channel 5 David Èlstejn, who also appeared before the Committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should re-examine Rita Mission in favor of "inform, prosveŝaj and razvlekaj.
He noted that only a small fraction of the BBC produced materials formally classified as educational-according to him, this 1% and 0.1% of television content on the radio and that the company must pick up an initiative of the Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "inform, prosveŝaj and razvlekaj.
On Èlstejn noticed that the BBC should make more efforts in such areas as "promenade concerts" (only some of them, he said, shows on tv), as well as to enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters, to make them available for viewing online.
"Sonogenetika" allows you to manipulate brain cells by using sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have deduced worms with genetically modified nervous system, which can be controlled using the ispul′sy sound waves.
Tiny nematodes are changing direction of motion at a time when they are sound impulses, too high to the human ear could hear them.
Pulses have an impact through activation of neurons, genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Related: researchers manage brain activity using light
Scientists told us that worms demonstrate the capabilities of a new methodology called "sonogenetika", the essence of which is to use ultrasound to excite certain cells in the brain, heart and muscles, while the ultrasound source is located outside of the body.
Shrikant Čalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the technique could one day replace the deep brain stimulation-invasive procedure in which the human brain electrical impulses are sent and which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Elegans worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Čalasani found that they began to respond when they were placed in liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He discovered that the bubbles enhance ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the body of the worms.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures, called "ion channels TRP-4" found in the membranes of certain cells.
Ultrasound waves make these ion channels open and excite the cells associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create a nematode that can be controlled by means of ultrasound, Čalasani made the genetic modifications of worms, so their motor neurons used ion channels TRP-4.
During the application of ultrasound to the impact on the modified organisms sound waves exacerbated microscopic bubbles and were introduced into organisms worms, activating the modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in "optogenetike"-a new direction, which allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light pulses.
Čalasani argues that compared with the technique, sonogenetika may have some advantages.
In contrast to the light that is delivered to the correct section of the brain by optical fibre, low-frequency ultrasound waves freely pass through body tissues, so their delivery doesn't need to take place inside the cranium.
"We believe that in order to treat certain neurological diseases in clinical environments, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able at the time to make the human neurons sensitive to ultrasound signal," said Čalasani.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to the muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited pytočnoe equipment-right on your doorstep!
The ads mock the British arms trade
See video Amnesty International protested against the exhibition.
Stunning killer drones!
Breaking the Iron shank shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light stun batons, causing unbearable pain, but not leaving traces!
The cheerful voice and hand-drawn animation leave no doubt that this advertising is the largest international exhibition of armament-caustic parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the intention of the British Government to "push" weapons of repressive regimes, taking advantage of passing in the center of the ExCeL Doklèndse exhibition of defence technology and security systems.
Still on the theme: exhibition of armaments DSEI: authoritarian regimes go to London
But special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and Metro trains that require you to look at them again.
"Important announcement coming on line 15 DLR on 18 September?"-written by one of the London underground font depicting the DLR line approaching silhouette of a tank.
In September this year the crowd arms nagryanet DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent weapons exhibition.
300 posters drawn by artists, who exhibited their work in "Museum of cruel design at Park Banksy" Dismalend ".
The team called the group "special patrol helped distribute them to London, using" cracker "promotional spots, 6-pound set of wrenches, which allegedly provides access to approximately one third of advertising space on the bus stops of the planet".
London transport mirthless from this "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the mock ads issued by the "Special patrol".
According to Gavin Grindona, curator of the exhibition and the teacher Designs Cruel Èssekskom University, artists are becoming more demanding and strive to convey political art to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists are beginning to work with activists protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of his art, if they want to influence society.

Creative Director, VCCP Matt Lever was struck by the silence of arms exhibitions around advertising-over ExCel calendar-and thought: "Let's make them campaign, which they are trying to avoid."
They are thought to create a more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but fill her house bright colors and animation turned out more exciting occupation ".
"They are incredibly helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the show," says Tom Davis of the Amnesty.
Now we need to let the British Government took measures and ensure that it is pytočnoe equipment will not illegally sold right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art exhibition on the theme of the arms comes from inside ExCeL, where participants traded fantastically èvfemestičeskoj.

Eight golden rules of accommodation in student hostels
Already it has been 11 years since I moved into the dormitory as a normal 19-year-old man, still believes in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember strained smiles those I irritated-and numerous, long a complaint on the other.
Basically what I have learned, can be decomposed into eight simple rules.
Transfer to the hostel can vary from slightly acting on nerves to absolutely frightening.
It encourages the chatter: telling people where you are, whether you took a sabbatical and where he was held, do you Corbin and why you "honestly, neither love nor hate" Marmajt "because, seriously, guys, this is just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'll host".
Take rest.
And help others take a break, too-ask questions and show interest.
It supports conversation and helps you find people that you like, and not those with whom you would not even talk to you, even if you have lit up the lashes, and they'd be handing out fire extinguishers.
Come on people space.
Room people often turn into pubs, midnight cinema halls and places of public gatherings, but they are also the kind of place where people dress up and correct underwear.
On another topic: don't even think of starting their studies at the University, being in a relationship
To introvertam at universities are unfair.
Your room should be a haven, however, many dormitories form the culture of reels from one room to another, that promotes friendship, communication and leads to a long friendly relations.
It can be hell for whoever tries to regain strength.
Nothing in the culture doesn't allow you to say "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to be gone, and I was able to recover energy that I spent with you."
Try to feel, when a classmate tired of socializing and not knock, and send SMS messages.
By the way, about the knock: do it.
One guy in my dorm have followed this principle: If the door was unlocked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends with the help of baking.
Because you start University life at the peak of its popularity the show Bake-Off, knocking at the door for people to introduce themselves and present a plate of chocolate biscuits is not such a strange action, not so reminiscent of 1950-ies with their "welcome, we are neighbors, I baked you something and now smile and I'll ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats are a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to chat with you, and eventually, probably, your face will be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how you're a good Baker.
Bad molded by lumps of flour, sugar and fat would rather make people pretending to sleep, when you're going to knock them.
Stealing food-typical crime in student hostels.
Of course, assigning someone's chicken-stealing, but is it theft-take yourself a little bit of milk for tea?
Refer to the owner of the milk.
Most likely he will suggest you not to be shy, even if inside boils with rage.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you-but try to treat this older than my neighbor, that jar in your dishwashing liquid milk to avenge those who had borrowed without permission.
She is now in prison.
You must not make noise that will disturb people sleep or study.
Not only to be a decent person, but because you are the same people from saying about glass houses.
Girl in my hallway asked a neighbor turn the sound of drum and bass, because it 3:00 morning, and her morning exam.
In response, a neighbor of increased volume.
When he finally stopped in 5 am, she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours, and then vrubila your music and locked the door behind him, heading for a three-hour exam.
Whether it was not romantic, if your future spouse lived in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, it would not be this extremely, till kusaniâ elbows, clumsily, if you took a neighbor for her future spouse, absorbed them, jilted and would see it every day, and perhaps watch as he draws on his side all your common friends?
Of course, my heart you will not order-but if the hot neighbor definitely not your future spouse, try to slightly cool own fervor.
In the exciting moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside a private locked room, the line between hoax and baiting is thinner than it seems.
Good drawing is fun, but turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Prepodaj valuable and interesting lesson on security by hiding anything-but never pačkaj chew anything room toothpaste and shampoo.
Zapri someone's door and lower keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer, but not paste the wrong things Blu-Tack adhesive to the ceiling more than two times.
IOS 9: how to install a new operating system on the iPhone after release from Apple
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Application Settings, select General, and then click Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download it and install.
Some have faced problems after installation when an error message appears, telling them that "update failed".
To avoid this, users should either wait until it blows over, or try to update via iTunes.
Tips on your phone allow you to go through the entire process until the end.
The process can include removing applications to increase free disk space-but Apple would minimize the likelihood of this action, reducing the size of the update, and also simplified the implementation using a special utility, which offers to delete the application and then reinstall them after you complete the process.
You should make sure that when you upgrade your phone charged or is near the charger to prevent battery discharge.
If you charge too low, Apple will stop updating, since phone discharge in the process can lead to failure of the update.

Washington responded to Russian military activity phone call.
United States Secretary of State John Kerry telephoned his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support that Moscow is providing President Al-Assad, only serves to exacerbate the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House isn't going to talk about it with his Russian counterpart, says PJ Media.
United States Secretary of State John Kerry telephoned Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
It is reported by the PJ Media publication.
"Secretary Kerry made it clear that the continued support of President Al-Assad on behalf of Russia creates the risk of aggravation and extension of the conflict, as well as adversely affect our common goal of combating extremism, if we do not continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power", United States Department of State said.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the commitment of the United States against the Islamic State "as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be able to be a member.
In addition, the United States "will be happy to the constructive role played by Russia in attempts to counter" Islamic State ".
Last Friday the White House representatives stated that they did not know exactly what actions are taking Russian troops in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between the President of the United States Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet arrived: "When the President decides that a phone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he picked up the phone and try to make this call."
Barack Obama himself considers the decision of Russia to increase support for Assad's regime "a losing bet".
I remember our conversation with Mr Putin, four or five years ago, when I told him that this is a mistake that the continued support of Assad only worsen the situation.
"But he has not heeded my warnings-and as a result, the situation has deteriorated," said the President of the United States.
Imported yachts are released from payment of customs duties.
The Ministry intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other vessels for pleasure and sport from payment of customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes in the list of soft goods for temporary duty-free importation had been prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
About this "News" reported Assistant economic development Minister Elena Laškina.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on a visit to Crimea instructed several departments-the Ministry of Transport of the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, Ministry of culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of emergency situations, the FSB, FCS, Rosturizmu-draw up proposals for the establishment of favourable conditions for sailing in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts say that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, maintenance, and contents of the yacht.
The owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad-approximately € 200 million go each year to the coffers of the European States for the content and maintenance of yachts.
The Russian Ministry has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "about modification in the list of temporarily imported goods with full conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes", providing full conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes on imported yachts and other floating facilities for recreation and sports.
According to the Ministry, it will certainly contribute to creating favourable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, Laškina said.
The question was submitted to the Sub-Commission on the customs-tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of the governmental Commission for economic development and integration, which met in September, and the discussion was also approved by the authorities.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of economic development, the proposed measure on full parole when importing is inherently privileged.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the meeting of the Subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry will propose in the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with Member States EEMA, explained Laškina.
In the list of imported goods that are entirely exempt from payment of customs duties and taxes include the goods necessary to assist Foreign Affairs and international cooperation, for use in the fields of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism to provide international assistance, etc. Among them is the Office equipment (computers, typewriters), instrumentation, drilling equipment, costumes and scenery, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sport aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and items for religious ceremonies.
The press-service of the Ministry of transportation told Izvestia that prepared the mandatory regulations on maritime ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, feodosiya, Yevpatoriya, which provide for a simplified procedure for registration of entry and exit of small sport and pleasure craft sailing in a sea port.
The Ministry instructed the captains of sea ports in Crimea to ensure the application of simplified procedures of call small, sports of sailing and pleasure boats in the seaport and the release of listed ships from the port.
The Ministry also prepared draft decrees approving the RUSSIAN borders, seaports of Crimea.
In respect of Yalta and Feodosia orders have already been taken, the rest are pending, the press service noted.
According to the Ministry, oversight, classification and inspection, State registration in relation to vessels used for non-commercial purposes, must implement the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia extremely difficult with Yachting it is due to poor infrastructure.
If you look at the South of Italy and France, there is a constantly evolving industry, which employs a large number of people.
In Russia virtually all stands still.
Our coast malointeresnoe, the only piece where you can operate year-round yachting, is the Black Sea Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that in this area extremely strict rules of the border service: in order to go out on a yacht, need to make a lot of permissions.
Besides inside Russia yacht even no place to refuel.
Two days she can go with her fuel, then the problem is where to get it, "said Nordmarine Sales Director Dennis Novikov.
With regard to storage places for yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special hangars for yachts up to 30 m yacht Also sent for storage in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov said that buyers of yachts-rich, but with the onset of the crisis the demand for yachts.
The World Bank allocated Ukraine a loan of $ 500 million.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $ 500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press-service of the international organization.
"New funding will support a series of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the statement said.
World Bank Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Cimâo Fan said that the reforms of the banking sector will help revive credit in the real economy and will stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and at the World Bank, watching the first signs of stabilization.
But due to the seriousness of the problems Fan encourages the Government of Ukraine to accelerate the reforms.
Earlier, the Polish Government approved a loan of € 100 million in Ukraine, reports RIA Novosti.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgenders.
The public Council of the Federal Penal Correction Service (FSIN) on the protection of the rights of convicted persons in October 2015 year among other things will discuss the possibility of establishing colonies of separate blocks for transgenders and transvestites.
About this "Izvestiya" told Council Member Vladislav Grib.
In his view, depending on the total number of convicted persons in Russia, unaffiliated with the floor, in domestic prisons may provide separate cells, blocks, or even (if such criminals will be many) created for transsexual special colony.
But Vladislav Grib stresses that determine on departure of the punishment of citizens in such isolated places is only possible after the convicted will be appropriate medical examination, which will prove that the offender is indeed a man identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib confident that transsexuals isolation from other prisoners safe serving.
According to him, the proposed practice successfully operates abroad: in jail (where the defendants before the Court decision) have separate cells for transgenders, and in correctional facilities-special blocks.
Today it is the only solution when dealing with such criminals.
Clearly they need to isolate, as the presence of transvestites and transgenders in normal cells is dangerous for them, it's the suffering of their families and the sea issues for staff of the FSIN.
Shemales humiliation by fellow inmates are guaranteed, "said Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big the city is, how many offenders with indeterminate sex, need and expect, where they distribute.
Separate DETENTION FACILITY don't exactly need-only camera units in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there will be a lot of transgender people.
As explained by the fungus, in a block can contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corpus will be created in Russia alone, then arrive at the departure of the punishment prisoners transsexual can come from any of the regions.
Citizens are kept in the remand prison of the place of Commission of the offence, therefore, proceeds or from other transgender transvestite actors during the investigation and trial are unreal, but to introduce such practices for convicted in a separate colony-Yes, felt Mushroom.
As we have informed, on the eve of the law enforcement officials were unable to decide in which remand prison-male or female-to identify the detained for drug possession 24-year-old named Dmitry Kožukova (known under the name Alina Davis), leaving the man with a maiden appearance was arrested.
His home was released on his own recognizance.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and media, as the mechanism for content of transgenders in SIZO and colonies in Russia really yet.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT activist (LGBT lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolay Alekseyev supported the idea of creating special places for serving the sentence, noting that transgendered abroad also detects people in colony-men or women-according to their own desires.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as well as the issue of security in prisons for homosexuals, "said Alekseev.
Prisons must be safe, so separate blocks could be done in the name of and for homosexuals, so much so that their prisons more than transgender.
While Alekseev doubts that Russia would prove to be a lot of citizens willing to impersonate the transgendered people in order to get into different from normal colony.
Of course, you can enter a medical examination before you put people in the colony for transgender, but not always all happens.
For example, in the United States one of the prisoners Chelsea Manning looked like a man already in prison and said he wanted to change the floor, "said Alekseev.
A person can feel anything.
But while individual locations to serve their sentences for transgender no, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the safety of such persons and to delve into the intricacies of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health on the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze said that the introduction of a new system for apportioning transsexual offenders in the colony can greatly delay the beginning of the sentence of convicts.
A Commission is a matter of Sexology, psychiatrists conduct long surveillance, is not one test, on the basis of which the precise opinion.
Today's Psychiatry opportunities permit.
Therefore, and before changing the sex of the potential patients are always such expertise-they definitely show whether a change of sex with surgery necessary, said Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how this system to introduce in relation to convicted, because on average the survey takes a month.
The doctor, in spite of the fact that, in General, the idea of creating separate blocks for transgendered supported, also doubts that in the current economic climate would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examination, transgender people in Russia units.
It is difficult to calculate, there is no official statistics, but given that homosexuals in Russia about 5%, then we can say that transgender people even less, and those who have such a deviation and commit crimes are few, Lordkipanidze said.
Now on the petition before the administration of the colony homosexuals, transgenders and so can get individual conditions.
Mikhail Antipov won Junior World Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk World Chess Championship finished among the juniors 20 years.
The ending of the Championship was more than intriguing.
The winner is decided only in the final round, and they became the Russian Mikhail antipov, who still catch the pole Krzysztof Yana-Dudu, who like confidently walked to the title.
The girls win celebrated Ukrainian woman Natalia Boxes.
World Chess Championship, held in early September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already by the middle of the tournament, it seemed, had lost almost all the intrigue, as the representative of Poland, Jan Krzysztof Duda, issued a series of four victories (competitions are held by the Swiss system in 13 rounds), captured the leadership.
Given that Duda was the top favorite for the Championship, and in General is considered one of the most promising young players, the likelihood that he will miss extracted detachment, was negligible.
And even when Duda has slown down the turnovers and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipovu reduce the backlog just 0.5 points, he remained an obvious front-runner in the race for the title.
Because Antipovu to catch up with the leader, you had to necessarily win in round 13.
But even this would not help, win his party Duda.
Plus this bound victory, of course, could have an impact on the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary errors.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov has managed to avoid them.
He coped with Francesco Rambal′di, then had to wait until his party complete with met Duda, Benjamin Sideways.
Fortunately for Antipova Polish chess brought confrontation with the Dutch.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points on 10 of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
But because he is a guide of Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, which Governor Natalia Komarova, traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded the Grand Prize.
But in competitions girls intriguing endings not happened.
Tournament leader Natalia Buchs (Ukraine) for the conquest of the title was enough not to lose in the final round, which it successfully did.
Thus, the Russian victory prevented her Bivol Aline catch up Top.
Russian remained second behind champions 0.5 points.

Igor Artemyev, head of the FAS, said that Office against indexing on 10% of tariffs for cargo transportation and provision of any State subsidies, as requested by the RUSSIAN.
At first they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10% and even multibillion-dollar subsidies from the budget, "he said. -
We say: this is wrong, this is too much, reduce their costs, learn to save, abandon expensive mansions, football teams, their own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its "much stricter" proposals that are now being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is considering the option of net settlement with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of the execution of a put option on shares for the full amount of $ 300 million, reported the mining company.
In this case you will have to pay in addition to the Sumeru Polymetal $ 80 million (the difference between issue shares in favor of Sumeru and market quotations), which may be extracted from free cash flow.
Sumeru have have until October 3 to implement the option either to demand additional payments.
The details of the negotiations in Polymetal did not disclose.
The option was entered into in the framework of the purchase Polymetal project "Kyzyl Kazakhstan.

Comfortable rate for investkredita-10-13%.
According to experts ' estimates, the market for lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-April of this year, sank 40%.
What is your estimated the situation today?
After the panic late 2014-2015 start year SME lending volumes had dropped considerably.
The reason is understandable: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Lending under the 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
If the Bank could lay in increased rate all his possible problems in the future, from delinquency to defaults, then now it is impossible to do: rates and so sky-high.
The current level of business rates on loans SMES is uncomfortable.
For a large part of the current level of investment projects is unacceptable from the point of view of their return.
The level of rates in the 10-13% would enable businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns on them.
As far as you estimated, satisfied the demand of entrepreneurs on the credits?
After the CENTRAL BANK lowering interest rate situation has improved a little.
Credit resources more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers have come to apply for loans are much less common.
First of all, the business doesn't understand the prospects of its development and future earnings.
Today the business one way out: it is necessary to learn to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
Need to more closely monitor the current results, control cash flow.
At the same time, the availability of financial resources necessary to use new technologies to modernize equipment, reduce production costs and energy costs.
All of this ultimately allows the company to make products more competitive and maintain business even in unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends of the market development of SME lending and will affect its development until the end of the year 2015?
Whether to change the interest rate?
Forecast for lower average rates will largely depend on the policies of the Central Bank, and now the regulator shows the sequence in question is lowering key rates.
However, a radical price drop of loans for SMES is not worth waiting.
The current situation problem, first and foremost, is inflation, which makes necessary increased interest rate to get real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia remains high even at lower rates.
If we talk about the level of delay, the traditionally small and medium businesses, limited opportunities to replenish funds and economic behavior correction options, of course, would represent a greater risk for lenders.
I would not expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.

Kiev ripped Atomic Union.
Kiev has formalized the rejection of Ukraine on cooperation with Russia on completion of Khmelnitsky NPP.
The Verkhovna Rada in Wednesday at the second attempt still voted in favour of the termination of the agreement with Moscow.

After the coup d ' état in Kiev in February 2014 year and subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries in Kiev began to collapse the relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry by declaring the refusal to cooperate on Khmelnitsky NPP project and the construction of a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.

From plans to completion of Khmelnitsky NPP with another contractor in Ukraine has not refused: back in 2014 year in Kiev stated that negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.

FedEx revenue is mixed, lowering projections for 2016 g.
FedEx reported disappointing results last quarter, and the giant delivery service reduced forecast full-year profit because of falling demand for cargo services and rising costs in his subdivision of land transport.
The company also said it plans to hire approximately 55 000000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx reported that hires 50000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell 2.5 per cent to approximately preliminary bid for 45 minutes before the opening of the Exchange Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn from $ 10.40 to $ 10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends next may, that 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $ 10.84, according to FactSet.
The forecast reduction is observed despite the rise in rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and the increase of fees for land transport of heavy or bulky goods, which begins in November.
The company said it still plans to increase revenue compared to a year ago thanks to cost-cutting, raise the gross income and the growth of online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "has worked steadily, taking into account the weak, compared with the forecast, economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.
Labour plans during the holidays were announced a day after statements by a competitor, UPS, that they plan to hire additional staff, 000000 95 about as much to employ in the past year.
For the quarter, which ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $ 692 million, 6 percent more than the year before.
Earnings per share totaled 2.42 dollars, close to the forecast average 2.44 dollars a share, Zacks Investment Research poll conducted by 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5%, to 12.3 billion. dollars.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks, 12.23 billion. dollars.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from recession in the sector of urgent international transport, which has resulted in a lack of growth in gross income in its express delivery unit.
However, the online shopping boom has sharply improved results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from land transport increased by 29%, but operating income remained largely unchanged due to increased costs for large pickup and self-insurance.
Express delivery Division received higher income because of higher base rates, while in the cargo sector revenue fell because of higher costs for labor.
On preliminary bids for about an hour before the opening of the Exchange shares of FedEx fell $ 3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $ 150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling to 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of 11 June.
The most anticipated for several years, leaders of the Federal Reserve system will spend two days this week for 27-feet table from Honduran mahogany, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of the ornate meeting rooms with a height of two floors above them will loom wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet l. Yellen and her colleagues have put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank has received a double order of Congress: maximize employment in the United States and hold here stable prices.
But since the great recession, the leaders of the federal system have recognized that there is a third, unwritten order: financial stability.
And this is the third order can be an unknown factor in almost sprognozirovannom decision which will be announced in Thursday, that the United States economy is ready to break away from unprecedented stimulus provided by near-zero short-term interest rates since the end of the 2008 year.
Even though most data show strong economic growth, recent turmoil on world financial markets may keep the already cautious managers of the federal system from adding volatility by raising the federal funds base rate-even for only a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey m. P′egza, Chief Economist at brokerage firm with Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, increased uncertainty around the global market enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus about what will make the Federal Reserve system, which itself triggers financial market fluctuations.
Approximately half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg projected interest rate rise this week.
Financial markets, however, expect that the federal system from this nothing, while a key indicator shows only about 30-percent chance of a quick recovery.
This could lead to the fall of the stock market if the federal system will raise the bid, provided that those decisions did not soften the blow with a promise that the next increase will soon.
In the Dow Jones index Tuesday rose to 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 599.85 16.
The rise was triggered by expectations that define the strategy of the federal system will bid on this week, "said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It will be a surprise if the federal system would increase the stakes at this point of time," he said.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve system, "they will have to go far in adopting its strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don't panic."
Other experts argued that a rate increase might appease financial markets because it removes uncertainty over how the federal system would operate.
Just a month ago the federal system seems to have favoured raising the 0.25% this month, making the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the United States recovery.
Yellen argued in the spring and early summer that it expects to raise rates this year, despite complaints from the Liberals on the need for greater economic progress.
While the emergence of new jobs in August slowed down growth in the employment market was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest level for more than seven years, and almost at the level of that in the federal system considered full employment.
Wage growth shows signs of accelerating.
And while inflation continues to be below the planned Central Bank annual target of 2%, the leadership of the federal system, stated that a key reason became the temporary effect of the sharp decline in oil prices.
The economy can handle higher rates, and needs them, in view of the reduction of the labor market, "said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist of Macroeconomics which was distributed by the Pantheon.
However, financial markets around the world became a shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones average index for shares of industrial companies dropped by as much as 16% relative to the highest values in may as investors feared that a slowing Chinese economy could dampen world growth.
Market partly regained their positions this month, and the Dow Jones is now approximately 10% less than the high of may value.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve system further complicates the difficult market outrage calculation period of increasing interest rates.
"In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news of weakness in the Chinese economy in the past few weeks they would tighten the screws at this meeting," said Stephen d. Oliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former officer of the Federal Reserve System.
Now, he predicts, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
"There is great uncertainty in what might be the consequences for the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data after recent developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not included in the main concerns of the federal system, and technically it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.
But essentially the Federal Reserve became a world financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
Only one hint from then Chairman Ben s. Bernanke in 2013, that the Federal Reserve can "Mute" its monetary expansion caused turmoil markets worldwide.
In a world where markets and economies increasingly intertwined, one would expect that the leaders of the Federal Reserve system will not only monitor developments elsewhere, but to consult with representatives of the other central banks and with experts, to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc., a company that deals with state management global strategies.
Jeffrey Luker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve system were cases of overreaction to the motion of the financial market, which does not seem to be linked to economic principles."
Luker, a voting member of the influential Federal open market Committee, insisted on raising rates, cited as an example of decision 1998-99 biennium.
The Asian financial crisis has resulted in the federal system reduced its base rate by 0.75% for three meetings, "despite limited identifiable consequences for growth in the United States," He said.
A year later, federal managers have canceled these.
The Federal Reserve system should be put in the first place concern for stability only in times of great crises such as the collapse of the market in the year 2008, "said Adam s. Posen, a former member of the interest rate-setting Committee at the Bank of England.
The latest panic and close is not close to that level, "he said.
"You would certainly not want to be in a situation where you scares rates increase due to the fact that markets are startling," said Posen, President of the Institute of world economy. Peterson.
Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until this changes, I don't think they should be ahead of the event.

As we have informed, the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened at Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and runs until 18 September.
Ponaslaždalsâ victory for a couple of days.
World Athletics Champion Sergei Šubenkov.
This season can be called for 24-year-old triumphant athlete from Barnaul Syarhei ŠUBENKOVA.
He has succeeded at its Crown distance of 110 meters hurdles win the Team Championship, set several records and become a world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier Sprint.
In addition, recently won the athlete of the final stage of the "Diamond League", finishing in third place in the overall standings.
"New news" asked Šubenkova share impressions from the outgoing season.
Sergey, the season is not yet finished for you?
Yes, I'm going to speak at the world military games to be held this October in Korea, then I would think about the rest.
The truth is, prepare now going home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still an entirely different condition.
All lighter than every week to wander the world.
You once said that autumn-favorite time of year for you.
Late August, early September is the perfect time.
Passion after the main season start otkipeli, load of responsibility no longer presses.
You can compete in fun, to "rasslabone".
Plus you know what and leave soon.
And there is fatigue?
Still, the season is special, lots of positive emotions.
Fatigue towards the end of the season always accumulates.
And here it is not important what do more-won or lost.
Each competition is stress.
Constant flights, transfers-all this does not pass to the body.
Get tired physically and emotionally.
But now the emotions I have, of course, is on the rise.
Yes that there-I'm just happy!
By the time finished at the World Championships in Beijing, come back often?
It happens.
Yes you, journalists, not give me forget about it.
But in general I believe that bad the athlete who lives old victories, scrolls its successful races again and again.
Ponaslaždalsâ victory for a couple of days-and you have to move on.
Preparations for this remarkable season strongly differed from the usual?
I can't say that it was something special.
Get ready we started back in December but winter competitive season I have missed.
Trained first at home in Brisbane, then in training camp, then again at home.
All as usual.
But with coach goal: try to get to a new level at which I was not.
Almost all winter time spent to lay the base.
Nabegali a bunch of crosses, doing exercises for physical training, which included and cravings, and squat, and back we has circulated.
Then began the barrier preparation, many engaged in technology.
For those how are rivals, watched?
I always try to do, in the Internet age, there were no problems.
Looked up the winter Championship of Europe, and there's a barrier the entire Sprint podium was occupied by the French!
Another thought: need something to do, to dilute this company.
With each start this season you added and added in the results.
This gave confidence?
I have all the latest seasons add up to roughly the same pattern.
Not that I'm running first, and then-13.20 13.50.
Always raskručivaû his form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do is run out of 13 seconds.
All of the work has focused on this result.
But the paradox is that kind of feel that I am ready for feats and competitions show his willingness not always turns out.
As it was, for example, at the Olympic Games in London?
I, honestly, the semifinal race (Šubenkov failed to qualify to the final.-"NOR") tried to forget at once.
Ready was very good, actually could run out of 13 seconds.
Yes even if repeated his best result at the moment would be the bronze medalist of the games.
But no luck.
His first World Championships, remember?
And what about?
It was in Daegu.
I really wanted to get to the finals then, had the maximum program.
And dropped off right with utreca, in preliminary races.
Then realized that tear and hurtle headlong means generally will not run.
Two years later at the World Championships in Moscow has already reached the final with the best time.
I remember well his feelings before the crucial zabegom: very much like already then win "gold"!
How to succeed in developing a decent speed, not to lose again and head do not disconnect?
And this is the hardest part.
You have to be very careful, focused on technology, not to cut barriers.
Noticed that when adjust is not the result, but on the process so much easier.
And the buzz when you have the feeling that you and all like itself!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the province after the first serious success seek to move closer to the capital.
Never had these thoughts?
The House is still best.
Yes, and I have no idea where I am without his trainer, whom I need?
Maybe it would be good to have better conditions, but I try to be satisfied with what I have.
(C) Klevcovym you been together?
With 12 years, since the Athletics came.
More precisely, first I trained his wife, who worked with children, and then she gave me.
I started with Sprint, then long hopped, triple.
Children's all-around was is when thrown ball, jump in length ...
In 14 tried hurdling, and I liked it.
Since the first race came out to perform the standard second adult level.
And stayed.
Fear barriers never had?
Somehow it happened to agree with them immediately.
But technology has always had to work a lot.
Won over one overclocking how many suffered!
But there is no escaping this routine.
Technique must constantly sharpen-to night I might awaken, I immediately got up and would run through barriers.
Everyone who saw your run in Beijing, claiming that it was a very nice run.
Thank you.
I enjoyed myself.
I usually don't review their races, but could not resist.
But over the effectiveness of the need to continue to work-there is no limit to perfection.
Not afraid now that the victory of the year before the Olympic Games, will rest on the shoulders of a heavy load?
As they say in these cases, I will try to live up to the expectations.
Once chosen this way, then have to go through.
My trainer likes to repeat: If you are not a wimp, no additional cargo must not feel.
And I absolutely agree on this.
Otar Kušanašvilli
Well, not so naive I me resulted in amazement the reaction to the interview, which took place in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand their bread not feed-Dai, toss the enemy.
And although I didn't flag obmatyvalsâ and the same, exactly the same thing a million times said here, and nobody called it, bastard-me more stung.
All my psevdodruz′â suddenly, second somewhere evaporated.
Pressure, to whom I am so strong, that even I, a beat-up guy, think people henbane ob″elis′.
Though gone myself, Shel, and you attacked the crowd and well mutuzit′ bars.
But you have to know me, I am not an eagle, fist me room, I'm from howitzers vdarû, old guys, I fear.
Another thing-no support.
I have so-and-so illusions, and now ...
Best in me has always been self-reliant, so that music.
And give this urodam passport, like Fred Durst or Monson may only assholes.
Better me better journalist work nestydnuû.
A week ago in Kyiv Otar Kushanashvili in sharp form described the Crimean events:
What is carried out with the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is referred to as annexation.
I believe that the reference to how drunk Khrushchev something tried to sign, in no case does not fit into the overall picture of human coexistence.
This is how come to neighbor and pick up his living space.
War from the Kremlin went and end it there.
I'm almost 100% sure on that, as in the summer of 2008, it started with a call to any bastard from the torture of the Kremlin.
I have guesses who it could be.
Kobzon didn't so much live.
I don't understand, he is the greatest artist, why would he need to lick the hands of Putin.
He that apartment will lose?
Well, demolished him.
Of course, people remembered him as belittling his small home.
And reconciliation now only from Vladimir Vladimirovich depends.

Diabetics with slight obesity can help obesity surgery
The favorable effect of Bariatric Surgery in people with low obesity, type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
Now, however, it is still too early to assert that diabetics with a little obese live longer after Bariatric Surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"Mortality statistics is manifested is not right," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, wrote about a new study in JAMA editor column Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or Bariatric Surgery, uses a variety of methods for reducing the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of assimilate organizam food.
For several years, bariatric surgery has proved to be an effective treatment for diabetes type 2, but the basic research was carried out among people with severe obesity with body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal if the value is from 18.5 to 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or above suggests that in humans, overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 is considered obese people.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from the Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected from the 2007 year, to compare two types of Bariatric Surgery-gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, with medical treatment of diabetes type 2 with a little obese.
The average value of BMI in those who underwent surgery, has fallen from 24.5 to 31 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, BMI in those who received non-surgical treatment of diabetes remains at approximately 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, fully cured diabetes 36%, and partly by 28%.
In the group receiving medication, for comparison, a complete cure from diabetes was observed only in 1%, and partial-only about 2%.
In addition, indicators of the blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," say the authors.
The researchers also monitored levels of hemoglobin in the blood, Getting that reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c below 7% hold better, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, remained stable, at around 8%.
But the best indicators of glycemic control, reflected good levels of hemoglobin A1c, not reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to research by Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results in two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, in comparison with the Group polčivšej rukavnuû gastrèktomiû, a group of bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), has achieved a greater reduction of BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin Getting (3.1% versus 2.1%), as well as closer to a complete remission of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study doesn't demonstrate the benefits of surgical method in part of life expectancy after five years, there is confirmation of the study people with overweight in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone from the College of medicine at the University of Phoenix, Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for people with obesity, have chosen bariatričeskoe intervention, the chance of dying over the course of 15 years was approximately 29% lower compared to the group, which had been used more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show the increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with a BMI less than 35 who are interested in such a procedure.
"The report is very important because it argues that such a surgery safely in the group with a low BMI, where there is no increased risk of death or kidney diseases," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously, as soon as the patient's BMI is in the range between 27 to 30.
"I believe we are waiting too long to get people to take it seriously," she said.
It seems to me that as soon as they have accumulated genetic changes in their bodies that trigger obesity and diabetes, reverse this tide is very difficult.

About this informed "Interfax" referring to the press service of the RUSSIAN INTERIOR MINISTRY.
The incident occurred in Tuesday morning.
Two unknown through the open front door, entered the home, located on Gorky Street, tied the 20-year-old son and mistress of House, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damages was 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case under article "Robbery".
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 of the Petersburg Hotel have the right to post host tourists in 2018 year come to see the FIFA World Cup.
Other hotels in no hurry yet to get permission.
According to experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to the World Cup have to urgently come up with authorities like the resettlement of all visitors to the city.
The interlocutors "Rosbalt" believe that because the tournament cost lease swap apartments will rise by 10-30%, and after the Championship for rented accommodation have to overpay.
FIFA World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the status of Russian hotels.
By law, written specially for the Championship, each hotel Petersburg must undergo the procedure for categorizing and prove that matches the declared number of stars and the level of service.
Now it is clear that not everyone would be able to do this: hoteliers are so wary of checks, which often do not even send documents to requests from the Federal Antimonopoly Service to Petersburg.
As said by the head of Office Vladimirov, Vadim OFAS examined 138 and now plans to make the case against the 34 hotels, many of which are simply not responded antimonopol′ŝikam.
There are signs that the leadership of three dozen companies obmanyvalo citizens, placing a number of stars in advertising, said Vladimirov.
The problem is that now in the account literally every room, no you cannot lose before the year 2018.
Officials suspect that the while the soccer championship fans will occupy all Saint Petersburg hotels.
Now the city, tourists can expect 30.5 thousand. rooms.
According to Smolny, St Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, four star hotel, 51-100 two-and three-star, 550-respected 1-star.
According to the first Deputy Committee for tourism development of Nana Gvičii, currently only classification 23 hotels-as many audits conducted by accredited company in St. Petersburg.
And here is the itinerary for any hotel such a procedure of regional enterprises, the Smolny on amazing coincidence is unknown.
That is past the classification may be more, but nobody knows about it.
"The last six months, the hotels are not very sought to pass the classification," acknowledged the Director of the Northwest Branch of the Russian tourist industry Union Ekaterina Šadskaâ.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers are earning more money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason budgets in which expenditures have not been laid on validation, the procedure may cost depending on the status of the hotel from 30 up to 100 thousand. rubles and more.
But all the same lately intensified and steel hotels managers apply for classification, assured Šadskaâ.
Hotels need to catch up to July 1, 2016 years, otherwise they will not only pay the fine, but will not get the right to work at the World Championships.
It is already known that depending on the star rating will be developed a fixed fee for the hotel room in hotel during the tournament.
The formula by which the cost will be calculated, will publish next year.
This is done to prevent soaring at 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to have a conscience and to prevent the increase in two-three times, but cheap and must be earned.
"I think growth will be up to 50%," explained the Russian Hotel Association President Gennady Lamšin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov not sure price-fixing corresponds to the understanding of a market economy.
Don't know how this fits into the framework of the economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better the unbridled rise in prices," he said.
It is unclear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
State Duma deputies have made Bill whereby hostels should be prohibited in homes.
We hope that this law will not be accepted or not will deal with St. Petersburg.
"We will continue to defend the view that hostels should be preserved," said Nana Gvačiâ.
However, she said, owners of mini-hotels in any case must be prepared to tighten the housing code.
If the State Duma still endorse the Bill, then in St. Petersburg will be closed for approximately 80% of hostels, and at the moment there are them 1.5 thousand. rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of restaurateurs and hoteliers Northwest Leonid Garbara in St. Petersburg lacks two-and three-star hotels, which are demanded by football fans, but is skewed towards hotels with four or five stars.
This situation is analogous to the situation where "on 80-thousand Stadium sit 75 thousand vipov".
You can do it just through mini-hotels.
Their possible ban expert considers "idiocy": "it seems strange that some people can live in the flats, but the visitors somehow could not."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that it is wrong.
But if as a hotel, in which guests come for a short period of time, then why not?
Mini-hotels run the risk to miss the FIFA World Cup and because of its sluggishness.
Whole hundreds of small hotels just don't have time to go through the classification, with a pit dig themselves.
By the summer of 2016 year ordered work will all hotels within the city.
"Companies that can carry out this procedure isn't much, so they will abandon less paid orders of mini-hotels, and will choose the ones that are more expensive," said Gennady Lamšin, adding that in some cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, parameters passed inspections currently considerably higher than St. Petersburg.
The reason for the delay is St. Petersburg including the constant reshuffling in the tourism unit of the Government, which is not conducive to teamwork.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels for all is not enough, that is likely to have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday houses.
Following the example of the 300-year anniversary celebrations of St. Petersburg in the city can mobilize river fleet, i.e. guests tournament will stay in cabins.
In addition, many fans prepared to come to the vans, in which it will be possible to spend the night.
"The main thing is not to set up as many hotels, then they were empty," said Gennady Lamšin.
Also very popular during the football championship will use the removable housing.
Most likely the city will create reserve swap apartments.
Rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
"From the obvious-the first will leave housing near the stadium," said rental specialist research and development agency in real estate Larisa Bragin.
With the price of the lease may not return to the previous level after the Championship, especially in residential areas.
This will contribute to the construction of new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she said.
And don't forget about the human qualities of the townspeople.
For example, Leonid Garbar sure that Petersburg was always hospitable city, where people don't just show the way, but can still hold and mini tour.
There are also complications.
My dad year 1970-m yard met a family from Murmansk-the father, mother and two children.
They turned out to be nowhere to spend the night: with hotels, it was then difficult to sleep at the station.
"And dad brought them into our communal apartment to sleep," he remembered.
True, added that now such traits in the inhabitants of the city were left-call home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But maybe in the year 2018 after unsuccessful outcome of the State Duma, hoteliers and Government errors have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "merged" Amur region.
With admiration today looked at Zhirinovsky's clowning in the Duma.
He did such a thing, when our generation still only studied trade newspapers, and is still in great shape.
His topic, like "protest against the results of the election, the LDPR in the Amur region".
Protocols not shakes-because nothing; other protocols besides signed izbirkomami, LDPR, apparently not.
Here he raises runner-up Ivan Abramov and yells something like "here's the winner of the elections!"
And no where on the Rodninu snaps, and then, after some skirmishes already presiding, leads the faction from the courtroom, vopâ literally "you all your fronts with rogues and thieves".
Press, naturally, gives emphasis not on abramova, and the scandal and demarche of fractions as a result of this scandal and insult.
Really beautiful and elegant Volfovich merged Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole country is another trick of Zhirinovsky in the style of "scum!" and not a protest against the results of specific political party elections.
And the faction formally poskandalila, and elections, if you believe the site party and Fèjsbuku Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but a leader with the theme obviously peel off.
Provides dead on the Amur itself to bury their dead, and blagovestvuet himself against United Russia in General and innocent Rodnina.
A neat solution to and not lose face, and in the present, rather than the flashy scandal does not go.
Another thing is that now in the odd position of turns and Sam Abramov.
In addition to the cries from the bosses he didn't waited for alternative protocols on your hands there.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, for a narrow circle of it became the formal pretext for insulting a respected champion and, even steeper hamskih attacks against UF and ULF.
And here he is, of course, must be seriously very think what to do.
Because of beneficiary elections, politics number 2 region and candidate number 1 on a single regional single mandate district he could become a pariah who successfully popol′zovalos′ his own party leadership and a super stimulus to the FRONT and the party leadership of someone else's.
That's for sure-would not have Zhirinovsky, it should come up and respectfully watching.
Mr. Trump it still grow and grow.
The news emerged that the LDPR will come back in the room during the next plenarki.
I.e. bath fell at all nor where.
The only topic Abramova a bury.
Beautiful indeed.
"It is impossible that all came to Europe"-Dalai Lama-RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current crisis of the refugees lies with the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in the countries that were the birthplace of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the center of compassion of the Dalai Lama in Oxford, dedicated to research ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, in the prevailing circumstances, interests of humanity must be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although it is admirable, the reaction of European countries on the refugee crisis is not adequate to the situation.
"It's neozmožno, that all came to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria with regard to the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"Caring for thousands of refugees-fine, but at the same time you have to think about long-term decisions, how to bring real peace and development, mainly through education, these Muslim countries," he said.
In the end, we need to think about how to reduce the number of killings in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force will never solve these problems, "he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush's actions after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, stating that the United States has launched a harsh reaction of uncontrolled chain of events.
After 9/11 I expressed his condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is possible through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and this has caused unexpected consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.
Four-time increase in the number of children who had ingested a hand Sanitizer, for the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States reported nearly 400 per cent increase, starting in the year 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age, had ingested a hand Sanitizer with a high content of alcohol, according to the poison control center of the State of Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the poison control center of the State of Georgia, cases of ingestion by children under 12 years of liquids for the disinfection of hands, reported in poison centres increased from 3266 in 2010 to 2014 in the year 16117.
"Children come in contact with these substances more often, and, unfortunately, some percentage of them is sent to an emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink liquid sanitising specifically, and some do it to impress your friends, or to dispute for social networks.
The videos on Youtube shows how teens drink sanitising liquid as cheap booze.
The teenagers reportedly mixed sanitising liquid with alcohol containing mouthwash to get a strong drink.
Younger children may bring pleasant smells disinfectant liquid.
"A child doesn't think it can hurt him," said Lopez.
Many of the pull (disinfectant liquids for hands)-those which is aromatized by.
There are liquid disinfectant for the hands with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
The disinfecting liquid for hands contains anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, only a few raspylenij can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's high concentration of alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician of the Poison Center at the Hospital of the University of Kansas.
You would have left would be just like a glass of whisky, but people keep in mind these hand sanitizers, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume large quantities of alcohol.
Naidža Russell, a six-year-old girl in the school, which recently swallowed a hand Sanitizer with Strawberry aroma of approximately four raspylenij, was sent for treatment in the Emergency Department.
Blood alcohol level she had 179, twice more than that of an adult who, by law, is considered to be under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie-emergency doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naidža confused the words and could not walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors observed her overnight in separate children's clinic, so as not to miss any signs of injury, because alcohol girl fell and hit her head, told Ritchie.
"It was pretty scary," told CNN Ortoriâ Scott, mother Naidži.
It could prove to be fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use nespirtovye substance or disinfectant wipes, in addition to remove disinfecting liquid for hands out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant liquid is associated with death.
In the year 2013, two women from Ontario died after having swallowed a disinfectant containing toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol-deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was specified as the active ingredient.
In January three pupil-profane in Northern New York conspired to poison them "nasty" teacher "by the proliferation of antibacterial substances in class", according to police.
The teacher have a severe allergy to the specifications for the hands, and she forbade to keep them in class.
Police believe that a failed plan was "empty talk" and addresses the issues of discipline, school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family Club.
On the back benches at the entrance to the children's library an edge to them. N.k. Krupskaya sad iron OWL.
Kids, who come for the books, trying to feed her chocolates.
Already several generations goes to the library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the 1920s arranged here loud reading, putting performances on poems, spent literary quiz and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
Correspondence lasted four years, and as wrote in 1939 year "Junior stalinetz" every day "friendship between hope Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends children's library of Barnaul" grew stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even expelled once distant Barnaul friends her childhood photograph.
And when barnaul′cy asked whether Nadezhda Konstantinovna library to have appropriated the name, wrote that no object.
Letter long ago dust in a Museum, and grandchildren and great-grandchildren first-time readers have to explain, whose harsh profile adorns the bas-relief on the library building.
In the years of perestroika is often called various people resented: why children's library is not renamed?
Let it be a library named a good children's writer, without political coloring!
Library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave things as they are.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Brisbane as "leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby-the yellow brick path.
"Volshebnik izumrudnogo goroda"-favorite theme artist Oli Moskovki.
Earlier, Olga was a manager at a law firm, came to work at the age of eight, went to five, and from all other managers differed only love to draw.
And then I found in the Internet ad: "you want Illustrator to books".
Book wrote a little American girl, and called it "My Cancer Mommy"-"my mother has cancer".
Olya has done illustration and thought life could end at any time, and any miracles in it, if you don't have them myself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books writers around the world and herself composes fairy tales.
Traditionally, children lose interest in the book that they increasingly live in a virtual space.
But we go read children and their parents understand the value of reading, says Russian planet, "Library Director Tatyana Kushvid.
In recent years we have even a moment arose the belief that children's library, and she will live-kids-then go here!
It seems to me, interest in reading is returned.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition of stained glass with fotoèkspoziciej.
Quarterly posted new photos of readers who go to the library for the whole family: mom, dad and kids.
In the library are pleased that children increasingly began to receive the Pope.
If in two years the child read just Chukovsky, later he needed books more difficult.
But now the law on which the eight-year-old prodigy is prohibited from Carnets 12 + category.
To get such a book, the child should bring a parents-they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them than something like a family Club.
There are treasures in the library-a collection of pre-revolutionary epics with âtâmi and eras, stories Korolenko annexed to the magazine "Niva" filing "Murzilki" for year 1936.
We are now not only conceptual space "shrine of the book", we are now open to traffic, we tried to become a special place: no home, no work, no school, explains Tatiana Kushvid.
To contact us you can come together to read, play, draw.
We did play area for toddlers-baby comes just play, and hand is still reaching for the book!
Some of our readers are parents claim, rather they abut not want legs go away.
Moms with strollers often come-and we are pleased that the library they tied for first place among all other places where you come with the kids.
Tatyana Kushvid said: today's children just as we once loved classical children's literature:
"Publishing is now evolving, and much attention is paid to authors who are the link between the generations".
And if we talk about little children, it is important to have some kind of hero who travels from one to another.
Kids don't like to part with their heroes.
The library publishes booklets for parents, which tells what is happening in contemporary children's literature, on which book you should pay attention and why.
Booklets are so fascinating and intriguing, as adults are interested in the, but the library still not for them.
Make books outside the reading room of the adults is prohibited.
This magical privilege only to children.
... In the farthest room library square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement in the book depository.
The stairs will creak beneath your steps is already very old time machine.
With a book of his childhood meet, as with an old friend: Hi, good that you do not change.
Ellie still fun steps on a road paved with yellow bricks, Roofing Inc. is a bummer steals magical matches and Mal′čiš-Kibal′čiš did not say damn buržuinam military secrets is such a firm Word from him.
Such books-as passwords, anywhere you can get to know her.
Available in the repository and the real book rarity-such as the pre-revolutionary collection epics with âtâmi and eras.
Korolenko the famous story or annex to the magazine "Niva".
Or filing "Murzilki" for year 1936.
Sostarilo time page, colored them in a tea color.
These readers are no longer issued.
It's shards of our future collection, I dream-retire and take charge of the rare children's books.
But the kids on this already, so to speak, not any: and paint in old books is not very bright, and themes. Open the first page, and there is Lenin, party, Komsomol.
Now it seems: why we're all writing the "Pioneer truth?"
But still it was interesting, says Russian planet "Galina Ilâsova, head of the book depository.
The page "Murzilki" darkened by time.
Galina Vasilyevna manages the depository of books his entire life.
She knows what color hat do Pinocchio, in which school year Harry Potter became the team captain Gryffindor Quidditch Championship, in what situations Carlson uses silencer for motors, and who runs the father of Alice Selezneva.
For the job of librarian pay little, and all those who can live without these book series, very quickly find another profession.
Only the most blinkered: educators, teachers, Ministers of religion books.
You can learn more and smile-it is believed that this professional feature children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of conversation is a professional.
I generally love children's books: how the Librarian I love that they are so smoothly and beautifully placed it on the shelves, and I love to read them, "said Galina Vasilievna.
I read all the military, historical novels, fairy tales, fiction.
Read contemporary Russian authors, fresh translations ...
Of course, it seems to me, in my childhood, everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that has been happening to me then.
And so as I madly loved them, I thought that the library is a magical place.
And I wanted to work there, where all the sitting and reading.
I hope that the book will always, in spite of the readers.
And rejoice when our former readers bring children, and even grandchildren.

Why I-witness executions in Oklahoma
Today, evading legal intervention at a late stage, I'll look like a human to be executed.
If this happens, and I hope that all of you do not, I'll sit on the lookout Gallery death in jail of Oklahoma, when Richard Glossip will be executed using lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses his death.
This request was first made in January, through his close friend, and while I was plunged into shock, I agreed.
With the approaching of the day I became afraid.
So why do it?
I agreed, because I thought that this is a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
This would have offered a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to be present at executions in America and, as there is often more than seats, results of the grim lottery of deciding who will be selected.
In Oklahoma Press seats reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotion.
I can't do it.
I will sit with the closest friends of Richard Glossipa, and we have been having their own relations after several months of phone calls and visits, which lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk with him.
The prison administration claims that I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I would not be allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me in Twitter that I postupaûs′ its impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of a prisoner as he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She acknowledged that she could better articulate "but still believes that I'm wrong in what I am doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with something from what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he is talking about.
I told him he could strike me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants the international edition of the journalist was present there to write about it.
If he dies, he believed that publicity would help the movement for abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver Castle, a reporter from "the Huffington Post", will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to podcasts, which I recorded.
I won't go into the details again here.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treeze make him guilty of aiding and abetting the crime.
But I believe that there is a high probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that clues to a death sentence was not enough.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective I'll watch as he dies.
I can't say that I would be entirely objective.
There will be other reporters who may be behind this request.
From me you will learn what it's like to watch as a man who I love dying unnecessarily.
Chased by the police man persuaded out of the Canning River
Constable of the town of canning Vale has managed to coax the man climb out of Canning River, but most stay dry.
Perth resident intended to evade the police, but did not succeed in it, entangled in dirty water in shallow water a few meters away from a police officer, trying to gently coax him go ashore ".
Police canning Weil was called in Tuesday on the fact of illegal infiltration into alien territory in Bakkingeme.
When police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them, rushing at Canning.
But he has not sailed away.
"He stood in the water and said," I will not go, let's grab me, "said staff sergeant Šandell Kasldajn.
Constable Laklanu Perhavecu don't really like wet form, so he used a more secure reception-"negotiations with a good policeman."
"Sometimes people do weird things to try to escape," said staff sergeant Kasldajn.

Peter Moody blames stewards in an attempt to espionage and threatens to withdraw from the equestrian sports
Peter Moody Racing Victoria stewards accused of trying to introduce his spy's stable in the past year and threatened to immediately leave the equestrian sport.
Its targets have become stewards and staff of the Division of ethics of Racing Victoria, which he accused that they orchestrated a campaign against him personally, and withdrawal from the start of Lady Tatai due to violation of regulations on the use of medicines in the launch day, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always puts all efforts by participating in the race, and he found himself in a difficult situation, when talking about the positive result of the sample Lidari for cobalt, which he cannot explain.
He prideržival language about the suspicions of spying for a year and a half and didn't want it "looked like green grapes".
"I'm not going to say anything about it, and have suffered for a long time, but sometimes you so knocks out of the rut that is no longer sderživaeš′sâ," said Moody.
They know that it lasted.
Sometimes react, and then you have to live through the consequences and I will have to live with what I said.
Today I will go home and be sound asleep.
I want to walk with our heads held high and want my owners knew I was doing everything for them.
When they begin to think that this is not the case, then I will need to stop being a coach.
Then I have to think what to do with their license.
Previously, Moody sensationally said during an interview on racing.com ethics Division tried to spy on in his stable.
"A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat down in a room with a man, whom I'll call if asked, and offered him a job in my stables, to pass information about what I'm doing in the stable," said Moody Racing.com.
They obviously think that I am a cheater.
If so, all of them, no doubt, should apply, because I catch them failed.
Robert Ralston, former Chairman of RVL, David Moody, the current Chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Sondri, nanešnij Executive Director of RVL, knew about it all the time and they know now.
Shouldn't this make me think that the case becomes personal?
RVL shouldn't take courage and held accountable for what happens in this business, other people, in addition to the coaches?
Bad I for this profession?
So I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they need to pick at my license and pushed me away, and I have no doubt-what I now say may force them to think about it.
But I got to the point now where I don't care, and it saddens me.
Me from this really sad.
I'm going to pressure them and will entrust responsibility for the adoption of the decision.
I have a family to support, and I can go.
Nuisance coach only grew during the long investigation with cobalt and Lidari, and the last horse removal from the start forced him to state that he can "fling their license on the table".
Moody, best known to those that produced the invincible champion Black Kaviar, called the requirements to the use of medicines in the competition day "ridiculous" after leg horse suffered a poultice made of clay, which is a violation of the rules.
This is a violation of the rules on the turf.
"I must bear full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my workers mistakenly made it to compress the leg.
She could get a poultice yesterday evening.
She could get it today as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody may be disqualified for a period of three months in accordance with the rules on the use of medicines in day of competition for the use of compress, which stewards opened an investigation.
This is a joke.
People who create these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.

Melbourne storm Coach Craig Bellamy parries accusations rivals in the use of hard power techniques
Melbourne storm Coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of the interception of the ball his team as "imposing the agenda" by the two favorites of the Championship of the NRL.
Sydney coach Trent Rusters Robinson stated that the judge allowed "During" to "fight" with his team during a sudden victory "Storma" in the final qualifying games in Sydney, on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made an explicit hint to "Storm" after his team won the finals qualifier "Northern Queensland Kaubojz" evening in Saturday when he called this game "typical" for Rugby League and said that two of the Queensland team were not "too successful" in melee.
Bellamy defended intercepting the ball and his team said that they were simply focused on "contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he has confidence his team by two leading coaches, because it means that they are worried about possible defeat by "Storm".
"It continues to pop up-I haven't heard Trent Robinson talked about tough receptions when they beat us by a score of 24:2," Bellamy said in Wednesday.
I can vouch that we haven't changed a whole year in their systems or techniques of protection, just over the last six weeks, we paid special attention to contacts when intercepting the ball and it was a turning point for us.
Trent there for three years, and he's obviously coached by an excellent team, so he's probably not used to play, and for him it was some shock.
Funny how it always manifests itself in this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea about "spectacular football," Recalling his teacher that "St. George-Illawarra Dragons" Bennett won the Championship in 2010, featuring "boring" football.
Wayne said about exciting football.
He decided to compare their game Saturday night with our Friday night and see how impressive was their game, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010. "Saint George" much criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that this did not concern him.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers impressive football, especially their young midfielders with their speed.
It is football, in which you wanted to play, when you have such players.
He made this remark in the year 2010, and now he wants all played football in his style-not every team has two running backs such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play this way.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because their few worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when we got to the big game.
Bellamy also noted that the game "Storma" and "Rusters" was a contest with a large number of points than the game, "Broncos" and "Kaubojz".
Game "Broncos" was probably good, I haven't seen it, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18 was two more attempts-and that this is an impressive football?
Or take spectacular breaks and failed attempts?
For me, it's routine.
If they mention about us, this means that at some point we may meet there with them.
"Storma" output by the end of this week, as they won the right to host either "North Queensland Kaubojz" or "Kronalla Sharks" next Saturday night in the preliminary final at AAMI Stadium, Park, tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.

Despite the fact that threatens life Maksimovich for attempted misappropriation of narcotic substances in a quantity sufficient for sale, counsel argues that There is evidence that he tried to get the whole party, and that the man could be in the Cafe without any malice.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maksymovych was worth let go on bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He frequently travels to Serbia, "he said in court Wednesday.
During the criminal trial, he lied to the police about their place of residence.
Mother and stepfather Maksymovych was invited to make a joint pledge in 200 000000 dollars for his release.
"From the testimony of the two it becomes apparent that the deposit 200 $ 000000 is too big a financial burden," said judge Flanagan.
But this measure is not enough to ensure that it will not disappear, "added the judge.
Maksimovich was allowed to be granted bail on condition that he surrenders as its Australian and Serbian passport, will report to the police daily and observe a curfew from dusk till 6:00 6:00 am.

Yes, I need some time to restructure the post, still in the NBA I'm more playing power forward.
Now, however, will need more to confront the great center of the opponent, but I've dealt with this before, so I think, and now can cope.
CSKA won the Euroleague last time in 2008 year.
Since then they have been six times reached the final four, but each time could not show his best basketball.
There is a perception that the team someone evil eye.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, this is difficult, I understand all the frustration of the Club and its fans.
But we have a great team right now, and if we show the best that we can, then we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
Always wanted to win this title, Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be a year of CSKA.
With regard to the evil eye, I am not a superstitious person and I do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you connect these two things, then everything is possible.
I have before the games there is no certain rituals, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.

Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta said that his teammates must support the injured Jack Wilshere's before the game against "Dinamo Zagreb"
In conversation with Uilširom Wenger also stressed that still only September, and that if the restoration of Wilshere's will go according to plan, then there is nothing to prevent him returning to the game for Christmas.
The favourable developments Wilshere exactly will miss at least four games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains questionable.
More about this recent problem that Wilshere confidently finished the previous season with only an ankle injury and was about to return to its usual aggressive style of play during the pre-season training.
Wenger: "this injury does not threaten his career.
It's just not up to the end of the zaživšaâ bone.
Nothing serious.
This is just a fluke.
It's not related to the ankles or with injuries that occurred to him before.
This may be related stuff from a medical point of view, but as also made Wenger, there is an associated risk of additional injury for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfortunate trend.
According to Premier Ltd, Wilshere's Injuries recorded 23 different injuries that occurred to him in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he played in only 65 of 157 games for arsenal in the League for the past five seasons.
If you look at the deal for Arsenal's wider, you'll notice that in six of eight seasons, beginning in 2007-08, arsenal was one of two Premier League clubs, who missed most of the day due to injuries.
Wenger admits the chance of getting stuck in a vicious circle, but arsenal believe that improved statistics on injuries in the season finale, will continue.
"Sometimes, returning after an injury, you're in for some time to visit vulnerable-during that time you need to recuperate and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack young enough and will cope.
I hope that he will recover physically, I am sure of that, and how is that his career will be such that it deserves.
Arsenal begins campaign in the Champions League in Wednesday's match with Dinamo-Zagreb "and will continue it in Saturday games with Chelsea and next Wednesday-with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the whole.
Héctor Bel′erin and Aaron Ramsey have not arrived in Croatia, so most likely will be in the starting line-up to play Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta.
Perhaps Wenger also enters in the composition of Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Morealâ and Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain a balance and to give a little breathing space to players who need it," Wenger told.
Although arsenal are an absolute favorite in Group F, Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most disappointing in Europe.
Dynamo lost none of the 41 matches since they happened to spend last season as "Invincible".
In Tuesday night's stadium has been exposed to earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was 10-m in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal learned lesson last season, when the team suffered defeat in the Champions League game from the Principality of Monaco, and remains with a faint hope to lead the Club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
"This is an incredible drive," said Wenger.
Arsenal still never did.
We were very close to the goal in the 2006 year, but, on the other hand, I'm a realist.
We have the ambition, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show, which has taught us lessons of male friendship
The absence of such stories is evident, especially considering how desperate the need became men in frankness, now more than ever, despite the fact that the suicide rate among young men is on high for 15 years.
In the year 2013 it was only the biggest cause of death for men aged between 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom, and with men happens three times more often than women.
In an attempt to understand the problem of "campaign against the miserable life" announced 2015 as the year for men to challenge a culture that gives men not to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is located at the heart of this battle, to take up the challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 students with symptoms of depression, found that if a patient has a fairly large number of friends "in good spirits", the chances for a cure are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, mentally healthy circle of friends halves the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, to friendship work, first of all, that it was.
In an age when communications are managed by social networks, when the style preferred content, quick response is often appreciated more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles need to seem strong, loving fun and successful, even if in reality the reigns of loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values of money, image, social status, entirely from internal values, our internal striving for personal growth and friendship that stronger affects our mental health.
And, as recently noticed one billionaire, creator of video games for money in General can't buy more happiness.
The dignity of the Friends that they attract attention.
Each of the characters was determined not through their work, but rather through the personality which manifested itself in communication with friends.
Humor Joey and permanent embrace of Chandler, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, sighing Rosson Rachel-all proceeds from the understanding that men can feel, even if they often refrain from full study of his feelings.
The employee told me "Samaritèns": "... my role of listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal moods, emphasizes how even the small Fellowship of friends can benefit. "
Often, those men who turn to us, feel unable to talk with friends.
The old homily "live" much in the same way as the feeling that a frank conversation about the problems could be perceived as weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-running coping mechanisms.
It emphasized the subtle moments of male friendship.
With regard to my task status outside, conversing on the phone helps people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from the inner circle of family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, where the holiday is fully restored scenery, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see a person living alone Starbucks, smile and say "Hi".
Don't guess what benefit can bring friendship.
Tv series Friends show on Comedy Central from beginning to end, all 236 episodes, tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores, helping PSG beat Malmo "
Angel di Maria on a par with Blaise Matûjdi and Èdinsonom Cavani celebrates goals in Malmo.
Angel di Maria, making its debut in the Champions League, scored a goal, than allowed PSG easily bypassed "Malmo" into Tuesday.
Here's match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani made his case, when Paris Saint-Germain FC began its Champions League game with an extremely comfortable victory 2:0 against "Malmo" at Parc des Princes Stadium in Tuesday.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after he started his first game in the Champions League as PSG player, to set the direction of the French champions, but they missed several opportunities before finally increased their advantage when Cavani scored a goal on 61 minutes.
Along with "Real Madrid" and "FC Shakhtar Donetsk in group a," Paris had to take a good start in the game against Swedish champions as they set their sights not on the playoff qualification, and the continuation of a series of successful games the past three seasons, where they reached the quarter-finals.
They earned points, but at the same time, it was not the best solution by Laurent Blanc calculate Zlatan Ibrahimović futile assault and later replaced him on the field in the game against a team from his hometown club where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or away matches in the Champions League, so to win with a score of 2:0, deliver rivals problems and fine play in protection-it's a good start, even if there are moments that we will need to finalize during the season," said Blanc.
This is promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I regret that we do not have scored one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic came back after an injury in one of the substitutions in the membership of the Paris team that earned her a draw with the score 2:2 against FC Girondins de Bordeaux in the first division at the weekend, but it pushed back to back di Maria in the fourth minute.
Argentine striker noted as a player capable of display PSG to a new level in Europe, after it bought last month from Manchester United, and he showed why when he ran onto a pass from Marco Verratti behind protection "Malmo" and nicely completed the attack, sending the ball past Johan Villanda in the far corner of the net.
However, if someone was expecting then from PSG's easy and big win, they had to be disappointed.
"Malmo" that defeated Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, with nine players on the field in world-class early in the game, five defenders and two midfielders anchor in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of hitting, Nikola Džurdžiča, where the ball flew past the far post Gates Kevin Trapp on 34 minutes, they attacked quite a bit.
But PSG at times let itself ineffective and weak attacks, notably from Ibrahimovic, who is only in the first half could not implement at least five attempts, and then was unable to handle the ball to Cavani scored immediately after the resumption of play.
However, it proved to be much more skilful in precise pasach, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, having received that, di Maria sent the ball twisted blow which took place next to a bar by Wieland on 52.
The second goal is finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, Uruguayan scored his sixth ball of the season after Ibrahimovic sub-rules ball sent into the center of the field with a left-wing cross by Maxwell.
This marked the end of any ideas that were with "Malmo" to return to the game, and just catching the ball Vilandom at close range prevented David Luiz to increase the final bill before it goes to replace Èsek′elû not counted Lavezzi goal in the closing stages of the match.
Coach Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, while Norwegian said: "our last Champions League game was held in December last year.
Since we only played in the Swedish League, and this is not the level.
Qualification is not enough.
The Fame Of The "Paris"!
It was a wonderful match with them.

Lead Economics ― Nobel Laureate: globalization
Print processes of globalization were supposed to contribute to the reduction of inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in incomes in developing economies, by contrast, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To fix this, there is a need to improve the education level of low-skilled workers, Chief researcher at the International Laboratory for analysis and selection of HSE solutions, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Economics, 2007. Eric Maskin.
In the past twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries were becoming more open.
Proponents of globalization had predicted big gains for developing economies.
"And these projections largely fulfilled," Maskin said.
For example, China and India have got a serious increase in per capita GDP.
However, not all sunshine.
It was expected that globalization will reduce the gap between the "haves" and "have nots" in poor countries, which is reflected in the large income inequality, and more pay.
But actually this inequity has only increased, said Eric Maskin, in his article "Why global markets not reduced inequality in developing economies", published in The World Bank Economic Review, which translated and quoted the INE HSE.
Together with the Economist, Michael Kremer of Harvard University Professor Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why increasing differences in income in poor countries as increasing globalization, reminds INE HSE.
In the new global market undergoing the specific processes.
To them to demonstrate, Maskin allocates four skill levels-a and professionals (B) for rich countries, (c) and (D) for the poor.
After globalization professionals from poor countries lack the skill levels to collaborate with specialists from a and B from rich countries.
And if workers from poor countries with level salary grows thanks to the cooperation with officials from wealthy, employees D growth do not feel their paycheck does fall.
The net effect is that the internationalization of production will help widen the gap in pay between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, consequently, raise the level of inequality.
Kremer and e. Maskinym offered a surprisingly beautiful model, alternative rikardianskoj the theory of comparative advantage.
It helps to explain why globalization has led to disparities in income, "said Fuad Aleskerov, Professor, head of the International Laboratory for analysis and selection decisions, the head of the Department of mathematics of the HSE.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a great surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskina, is to raise the educational level of low-skilled workers.
However, the employees themselves, as noted by the scholar, did not have the funds to pay for unprofitable companies and their training.
In such a situation a significant role can be played by Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations, believes Maskin.
Scientist notes that the theory in no way calls to stop the process of globalization, which has brought and brings to fruition in the form of GDP growth.

United States Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
American Embassy in Russia expressed regret in connection with the closure of the airspace at the library of foreign literature of the American Center.
The Centre worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
United States Embassy in Moscow was deeply regrets the unilateral decision by the Russian Government to close the American Embassy United States Center at the Russian State Library. M.i. Rudomino in Moscow.
"Unilateral steps taken by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION recently questioned the Russian Government's commitment to the linkage between Russian and American peoples, which are not interrupted even during the cold war and other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries," said in a statement the United States Ambassador John Tefft, received by Interfax.
American Center has created a deep and strong ties between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
He represented the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American personalities, among whom were astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"In the last year alone, American Center conducted more than 400 cultural and educational activities and took more than 50 thousand Russian visitors," said the diplomat.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project-a programme of educational exchanges FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
Green Tribunal proved to be fast on the massacre.
Typical situation: four officials facing the judges table Svatantera Kumara, listening to its claim to the work done.
The Court is totally not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We have not provided you with 110-page order that you spent on it, "said Kumar. -
If you will put at least another brick, we carry all available prikažem.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NRT), a body of the judiciary, established in 2010 year in order to stop the rapid pollution Wednesday, accompanying rapid economic growth in recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has had time to consider more than 10 thousands of lawsuits related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological engineering, toxic waste and the construction of dams.
In two of the three cases the Court takes a decision on the cessation of the construction of leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high in less than 60 years since the Declaration of independence strengthened industrial development India changed from a country of virgin jungle in one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large cities, where infrastructure has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers filled with pesticides and waste management enterprises and households, and the few remaining residential areas being cut down for building new residential quarters.
Despite the formal support of the green movement on the part of the State, the NRT is regularly criticized by Government Narendry MODI, as often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
So, in May this year, the environmental Minister Wednesday called the Court decision "extreme" and "overwhelming".
Sometimes a court decision really impossible to fulfill the Court delivered term confirms the lawyer on environmental cases Raj Pandžvani.
However, unrealistic deadlines and have the positive side: at least they make responsible persons to stir.
"Its main purpose-peretrâsti this system," adds lawyer.
Green Tribunal have repeatedly been canceled major construction: on his account the cessation of the construction of the airport, power stations and hundreds of smaller installations.
The people try to remember too: for example, during the discussion of the fate of the pharmaceutical company in the State of Telagnana, the local zagrâznâvšej River fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we answer and for the economic consequences.
"People will lose work," commented on his decision of Kumar.
But such explanations do not always find understanding among ordinary people whose lives can change with one stroke of a judicial pen.
In April, the Tribunal has decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years, the entrance to the capital than aroused public indignation.
Despite dramatically falling popularity and a barrage of criticism, Svatanter Kumar refused to reverse the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Delhi Government statistics about enters and leaves car, and also made a proposal to purchase 10 thousand additional busses, preliminary learning in factories, whether they were in a position to comply with such order.
As the scope of the Court's attention began to be exposed to pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even traffic incidents, people's anger began to slowly die down.
But the sick judge principle theme was a programme to clean up the Ganges River, announced with fanfare by Prime Minister Narendroj Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges River, sacred to Hindus, the judge often ceases to restrain their emotions and goes to the Creek.
Know what does the word "Holy"?
Someone poured water from the Ganges to the statue of the God, and it turned out to be feces, gorâčitsâ judge. -
You continue to pollute the River, because think: Ganges this gang, he will take away all our sins.
It is the river that we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
Cleaning the Ganges is the most ambitious and costly environmental project, announced by the new Government.
Currently, the amount of fecal bacteria in the river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.
Each year from 1.5 to 3 from 700 million swimmers it Hindus die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Fund for the salvation of the Ganges money raised from the sale of his suit, in which he met with Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused Premier populism: the suit was bought for 700 thousand dollars, while cleaning the river requires at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India is still a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but did not believe that the price of progress should be the environment.
"In a developing country talk Wednesday about the environment are often perceived as a luxury," said activist call Ganga Malika Bhanot. -
And the Court tries to strike a balance between the environment and development ".

"China should concentrate on attracting foreign investors and experts, and develop a policy of openness," he said, addressing the participants of the meeting 16 Committee of the Central leading group on the all-round deepening of reforms.
According to him, the increased openness and deepening the reforms would give the economy new impetus and vitality and provide new space for economic development.
The leading group had adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of the regulation of access of investors to the market, changing the rules of border control, the promotion of State-owned enterprises (SOE) to attract private capital and the revision of the system of registration of inhabitants.
According to the statement, an inventory of the sectors of the economy and production, inaccessible to invest.

The meeting also discussed the provision of rights lawyers and professional training of judges and prosecutors.
According to official report after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Ministers Liu Ûn′šan′ and Zhang Lichang.
