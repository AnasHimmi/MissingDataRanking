During a call to the 911 teacher recognized in girlfriend's murder
During a call to 911 voice almost trembling university teacher Shannon Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that we need employees who would come to their home.
Lamb said that there is a "doggie" in the house, which is still alive, but probably upset, and said that contacts the family members of the deceased can be found in her phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note scrawled by hand on a white sheet of lined paper: "I'm sorry, I'd like to return everything back, I love Amy, and she - the only woman who ever loved me" - said in a note, according to representatives of agencies, signed Lamb.
Nothing indicated that the Lamb, who led the two-line course at the University of the Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had the time to go over 300 miles in the university campus, where, according to police, he shot a respected history teacher Ethan Schmidt on the threshold of his office.
Chief State University Police Delta Lynn Buford said that university staff learned about the shooting at 10:18 am.
He said that the true Lamb made the call to 911 shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day the victims would be one more: Lamb committed suicide, as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting in the school forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, enforcement officials were still trying to lay down a single picture of the motives that led the Lamb.
The information that is shared inspectors at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to create a portrait of the talented, but perhaps troubled teacher.
The students were told that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier where Prentiss died, said that is not listed charges of violence or criminal cases for him.
Sam Schmidt Lamba included in a book he wrote in which he expressed gratitude to the "beautiful people" with whom he crossed in his teaching life.

Another student, Michael Sykes, said the Lamb at the end of the 2014-15 school year, told him about how he struggled with stress.
Earlier Lamb asked Delta State University grant him sick leave, saying that he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the rules of the university recruitment meant that the degree of doctor, receipt of which is so persistently worked Lamb would not have guaranteed him an automatic receipt of a teacher.
University President William Laforge said that he knew nothing about the conflict between the Lamb and Schmidt, but "obviously, Mr. Lamb was something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb would not be able to answer more.
Police on the trail of the Lamb after his escape from the campus, while on his way back to Mississippi, Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lumb shot from otdnozaryadnogo pistol caliber 38 in the back yard of the house, one mile south of the house of his parents in a suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Broomsticks Johnson.
His car with the engine running was still standing in the driveway.
Nesrazu could not understand why Lamb arrived at the house, though, according to Johnson, it is believed that he knew the people living in it.
Lamb grew up in these parts.
Lamb began working at the university, where the number of 3500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received the degree of Doctor of Pedagogical Sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of old friends Lamba described him as an intelligent, charismatic and cheerful person.
Carl Hairston said that she was 15, and Lambo 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a great guy older, who for several years trying to teach her to play the guitar.
In those years, he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls melted when he was close, "- said Hairston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Prentiss Lamb and by the time of the event, apparently occurred already for some time.
During a call to 911 Lamb said: "I have killed my wife", but the record of the registration of their marriage is not.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gautier in a brick house, the reverse side of which overlooks the canal.
According to police, the dog all right.
Prentiss former husband, Sean O'Stin, said that they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"It is quite depressed," said O'Stin about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said that he had not met with Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail, that Lamb was interested in music and playing the blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss, when he and Abigail both played for three years at a summer festival back.
Then they played together from time to time at the concerts.
O'Stin told that his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked at different companies online.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and part-time coordinator of the entertainment programs in a dimly lit bar The Julep Room on the outskirts of Gaultier, said that the last time he saw Prentiss Lamba and the evening of September 5, when the Lamb finished playing the guitar and harmonica for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
"Just happy couple", - he said.
We had fun and made fun of each other.
In the sense that they were both very witty.
Schmidt, who died instructor led seminars for freshmen and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America, - said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the same institution.
He was married and had three young children.
He attended Kansas State University in Emporia, and was president of the fraternity and the student government.
The campus of Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday night about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members participated in the memorial ceremony of lighting candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We try to bring our students" - La Forge said.
The crisis has passed.
Today recovery day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped to prepare Associated Press writers Emily Vagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police statement that the call Lamba enrolled 911 after Schmidt's murder, as well as due to the fact that although the Lamb and talked about Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, information about the they were married, was not confirmed.

8 survey results, which show that Donald Trump was not joking
Some tried to hang him provocateur label.
Others waved him off, took as a joke.
And some require a scandal.
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to shake the position of Donald Trump in the results of the poll, they failed (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed the advantage of Donald Trump in the double digits, and some are starting to seriously ask, what does this mean for the real estate tycoon in terms of chances to get a nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to be nominated for the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011. Rick Perry conceded his preimschesvo gaining popularity Herman Cain, none of whom won one state and in the process of nomination.
And there are many reasons why it would be a fight in the general election.
But external groups, such as "political supercommittee actin" Jeb Bush, and conservative economic group "growth club" recognize the relentless force of Trump and start to get their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some figures on the poll who say that the real estate tycoon - not just a transitional phase:
Choice Ratings for Trump turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey in Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans a positive attitude to this real estate tycoon.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a positive attitude to Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say that they have a negative opinion.
And all these figures the upper hand in the early stages.
Quinnipiac Poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there are polozhtelno Trump.
Two-thirds of votes for the GOP would suit Trump as a candidate.
The CNN / ORC poll, conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either treated "with enthusiasm", or with "satisfaction" if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be treated "with enthusiasm" against 40 percent who said the same thing about Trump).
Next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, who is just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they are "dissatisfied" or "frustrated" if the establishment favorite Jeb Bush would be a candidate.
Most Republicans do not believe Trump's temperament problem.
While Trump massively criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 percent to Republicans leaning voters nationwide think that the tycoon suitable temperament to be president, as the poll ABC News / Washington post, held on Monday.
The same figure appears on the first in the country caucus in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he is the man who can be a top commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he is not the man who can be effective in the post, and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament is not suited for the White House, according to ABC / Post reports.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their hats connoisseurs of Republican voters think Trump - it seriously.
On the question of who is the most likely winner of the GOP, four out of 10 said that Trump was the favorite, according to the CNN / ORC poll last week.
This is not the case, when four of the 10 put on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: I GOP voters had not been properly magical Crystal.
At the same time last cycle cycle four of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported a possible candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it shows that a plurality of GOP voters think Trump campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans have rallied around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts suggest that this variation is likely to play a Trump advantage, and at the same time do not support Trump evenly distributed among supporting more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September, shows that in a hypothetical contest, "one on one" between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump nearly always gets the support of the majority.
He is ahead of Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally, Rand Paul, John and Chris Christie Kesich 33 points.
He draw with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who passes it?
Ben Carson overtook businessman on the whole 19 points in a hypothetical contest, "one on one".
Slightly more than half of the supporters Donald Trump said that they changed their minds.
New poll CBS / NYT, held on Tuesday, shows that just over half of the voting, supporting Trump, say they are confident in their voices.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change the situation, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
But Mr least, the most intense competition in Trump at the moment - with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they changed their minds, most likely, will choose the Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called two months ago, immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his speech, the opening campaign, the immigration issue has become very topical in conversations in 2016.
Some worry that Trump posturing turn away the key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and prevent re-branding.
But according to a survey ABC / Post, held on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Therefore, as long as the immigration attracted worldwide attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Government Disappointment is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson is now counting on the support of about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday the new ABC poll / Post say they want more political outsider than a person with experience in government.
And they are also offended by Washington.
Poll Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa disappointed Republicans in Congress activities, while 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "in a rage".

The decision of Mr. Corbin does not sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbin said that he "stood in respectful silence" and recognized "the heroism of the RAF in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of the Shadow Cabinet, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of the Labour Party to sing the national anthem "independently" from his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in the team of Mr. Corbin, voicing disagreement on economics, defense and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant said that political differences as "piling up stack" in the Labour Party after the appointment of Mr. Corbin to the position of the European Union and limiting government compensation.

The forecast is based on the assumption that the Aldi next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 - in WA, having achieved sales of 500 million and $ 600 million in these markets, respectively.
Lost revenue and volume of food sales at a high level of permanent costs Metcash can cost the company about 13 million earnings before interest and taxes, according to Mr. Kirata.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, and this despite the fact that a recent study by Morgan Survey company has found out that the IGA most loyal customers.
The Morgan Stanley believe that the sale Metcash food will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company's share of the market from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, a leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, saw the audience at a business luncheon in Melbourne that Metcash "may very likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash company declined to publicly comment on the comments of Mr. Douglass.
But it is assumed that a member of the board of directors Metcash contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
Share IGA market declined since 2010 from 18 to 14 percent, and Metcash revenues from in food business, which the company supplies about 1,200 retailers IGA, fell by 43 percent compared with 2012 due to operational deleveraging and due to pressure on sales performance and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than 150 million dollars annually for the adjustment of retail prices with the prices in Coles and Woolworths for a thousand items every week and helping IGA retailers in the reorganization of trading platforms, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wide range of specialties food.
Director General Metcash Ian Morris said that the price adjustment and conversion of retail space is gaining momentum, and hopes that the company will achieve the increase in net profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi kokkinakis supports Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for their behavior.
Thanasi kokkinakis indirectly affected in the recent scandal around his friend Nick nick kyrgios and for their behavior deserves honor more than criticism as Tennis Australia president Steve Healy says.
Kokkinakis, Jr. in the talented duo, and often referred to as "Special Ks", unwittingly became the focus of attention because of the infamous squabbles nick kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly afterwards, during the hot qualifying match in Cincinnati judge on the tower had two separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrisona, while Harrison said: "Wawrinka had to put on the blades nick kyrgios, and I have to put on the shoulder of the guy."
C since Kokkinakis was last seen-breaking racquet after a cramp in his leg Richard Gasquet saved from possible defeat at the US Open, Healy faithfully protects Kokkinakis.
The boy is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomic singles in the Davis Cup semifinals against the United Kingdom.
"I am acutely worried about one thing, namely, what Tanase was dragged into the conflict", - said Healy.
He really broke a racket when he cramped foot on the US Open, but he is not the first player who broke the racket when collapsed hopes, and I know Tunas well enough to be sure that he would not be proud of it.
But in fact he owned a very well pretty provocative situations in the US, Harrison, etc., and I am sure that he is trustworthy.
It is surrounded by a great team, he has a wonderful family, and I just think that with it came a little bit unfair.
It is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works hard, fits perfectly into the team, he has never had problems with other players respect him off the court he intensively trained, he's in great shape, he is very goal-oriented and development of young people, and I think that should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive nick kyrgios for the important match, starting on Friday, believing "mutual consent" correct way for everyone, but hoping that the guy from Canberra's return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all we want to make the team is fully focused on the match rather than the controversy surrounding [nick kyrgios]" - Healy said.
And I think that Nick gained momentum very quickly, as evidenced by people like Federer and Murray, it grows in the public eye, he made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to help him understand the consequences of their actions and it is necessary, I believe, take it out of the limelight for a while, so that he can reflect on them, and it is best for the team and it is best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares emergency closes border delays migrants
Declaring a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia, on the southern border and detain those who are trying to enter the country illegally, to keep flowing into the flow of migrants.
On the border of riots - accumulated hundreds of migrants in the border area on that very negatively reacted to the Serbian authorities.
Stuck for an indefinite period on the stretch of road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing from armed violence at home, pitched tents and settled in this area.
However, discontent grew.
When I hovered over them a police helicopter, workers shouting "Open up the frontiers!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian Police Task.
Some in protest refused food and water.
Serbian Foreign Minister declared "unacceptable" the expulsion of migrant workers back from Hungary where they are increasingly coming from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, rather than collateral damage.
It is necessary in the coming days to hold talks with Brussels and other countries, "- said in Prague Ivica Dacic.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border started on the next day after a block of 28 countries could not develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to have overall responsibility for 40 000 people seeking refuge in crowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future (in the next month or the end of the year) will reach an agreement, according to which the state - EU members will still 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded a raise in the next week an emergency EU summit to discuss immigration crisis gripping the continent.
Hungary, however, hopes for a speedy action on the part of Brussels or neighbors.
Tuesday's announcement of emergency in the two southern regions, the authorities gave more powers to the action on the crisis, which allowed them to block the road and speed up legal proceedings for asylum.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Peter Weng Siyyarto said that his country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence on the site of the Romanian border to block the flow of migrants across the country, now that she has finished the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata said that even prisoners were connected to the urgent work to complete the fence of barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main "bottleneck" and the point of intersection of the borders of the European Union for the displaced, many of whom are refugees - victims of war in Syria and the Middle East.
Nevertheless, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority arriving in the country people are economic migrants seeking a more prosperous life, not refugees - victims of war, who are entitled to protection, and this view is sharply at odds with the views of other EU countries, in Vol. h. of Germany.
The new laws, which came into Hungary in effect at midnight, consider now the crime of crossing or damage to the 4-meter (13-foot) fence of barbed wire, which was built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer jail terms for accused trafficking.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," - he told reporters government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged.
We are giving a clear message: illegal border crossing - a crime.
Formally, the parliament still has to approve the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but reporters Associated Press, which are located at the border for several days there was observed the presence of heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's national security adviser, said the capture of the authorized bodies of 45 people who were trying to cross the border, at the border, and another 15 people - inside the country.
They crossed the border, breaking a fence, are currently under police custody and accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
Authorities quickly restore the fence.
Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven passes on the border with Serbia, Hottabych delivers to block one of the passes of the rail car, wrapped in barbed wire.
Riots broke out in the main passage across the border near the town Roske (Hungary), as Hungarians placed office space for the passage of people inside a metal container, and crowds of people crushed each other to break in.
It managed to penetrate about 20 persons, while thousands of people were left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced the refusal of food and water, until they miss in Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has been halved in the national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the race for the Democratic nomination for the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton currently has the support of 47 percent among primary voters Democrats (down 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, gets the support of 15 percent of primary voters Democrats.
For more than five months before the start of competition in the primary elections of the majority of Democratic voters say it is still too early to talk about what they have decided on the candidate who will support.
Clinton Supporters are more confident in their choice, rather than keeps the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders got something no bonuses.
Clinton holds a big advantage among women and moderate, but this advantage is reduced.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is behind it all 5 points.
The preference for Clinton Democratic voters and 50 disappeared, and they Sanders is now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton overtook Sanders at double digits among liberals, but Sanders is now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
Almost half of the primary Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would have supported it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support it only because it is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps it is not surprising that the current Clinton supporters are likely to manifest more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who are not currently supported Clinton looks more contradictory - only about a quarter of it would be enthusiastically supported.
While 48 percent of primary voters Democrats say they have enthusiastically supported Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When supporters of Clinton is given an open question as to why they want to see a candidate for her, the most popular answer - that it has the required experience (16 percent), and then - this is the time a woman president (13 percent), and that it is the best candidate for this position (10 percent).
Also, Clinton supporters say the association, linking it with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also referred to agree on the issues, and the chances of election.
As the vice president is considering the potential participation in the elections, 57 percent of primary voters Democrats would like him to join the race - although a third said that he should not.
When asked who they would like to see in the second place among the candidates of the party primary voters are Democrats, in most cases referred to Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half said that they would choose Biden's second, it is more than that of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to stand as a candidate of the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton has an advantage over Sanders increase from 20 points with Biden among the participants in the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton, the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, this figure fell to 78 percent last month.
According to this indicator Biden with a large backlog in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate, increased.
However, when asked what is most important in a candidate, voters are Democrats choose other options besides the chance of being elected.
Similarly, the situation in the past month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates is unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
The Democratic candidate, or potential candidates, showed good results on some key characteristics among primary voters of his party.
Most said Clinton, Biden and Sanders honest and trustworthy people who have good leadership qualities.
Biden from all three leads for integrity and strong side of Clinton in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of primary voters Democrats do not believe Clinton honest and trustworthy, two times more than those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 per cent do not have a definite opinion about him in this regard.
Primary voters and Democrats generally believe similar ideological views Clinton, Biden and Sanders.
For all of these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have any opinion about Sanders.
Although the question about the personal e-mail boxes and server Hillary Clinton, when she was Secretary of State continued, most of the primary Democratic voters are satisfied with its explanation on this matter and believe that it will not adversely affect their overall opinion about it.
But that's another story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with her explanation, and are satisfied with only about one-third.
Public opinion on this topic in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say the controversy over the e-mail had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent say their opinion of her worsened.
Basically it is the Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who claim that their opinion of Clinton deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered fair and credible voters from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent consider it fair and credible, eight points lower compared to the previous month, and by 15 compared with May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not believe Trump honest and trustworthy.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades on leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Bush and Carson show the best result for honesty.
Most see Sanders more honest man than not, but, as Carson, many do not have any opinion about it.
Limit error for a sample of 351 primary voters Democrats is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of a national survey Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in a CBS / New York Times poll last
These two candidate scored half of the votes in a new poll, leaving all others in the search for underfoot support
Republican voters across the country continue to massively support the Trump, the percentage of support is increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll, conducted on the eve of the debate on Fox News last month, up 27% in a poll conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson flew over the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also revealed that Carson has the support of all demographic groups, surpassing Trump group of Republican voters with higher education.
The other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, rolled back along with the governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% today.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, together rank third with 6%.
Limit error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6%, the survey was conducted in September.
A recent poll by CNN / ORC, published last week, showed Carson rise in the polls - 19% showing support among Republicans for Trump with 32% support.
Last poll ABC News / Washington Post also revealed that Trump is far ahead of Carson.
With the increasing support for Carson at Trump last week made some critical attacks against the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for having questioned the faith Trump.
"We need energy", - said Trump last Saturday during the closing campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are accused of the death of Baruch College Freshman
About two years after the death of the college during the initiation ritual in the student fraternity in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania murder charge was brought against five persons.
"The members of the fraternity Pi Delta Psi of New York Baruch College brutally attacked Chan" Michael "Deng during the initiation ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital in time, which resulted in his death" - told the police.
Officials say that a student with a blindfold and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind him bumped a few times while he was trying to achieve the goal of walking on slippery surfaces.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache, and then fell unconscious.
Members of the fraternity Pi Delta Psi did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and still waiting for allegedly hour before to take him to the hospital, the police say.
They are, however, taking the time to change clothes Deng, found on Google its symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, to ask for advice, as told at a press conference the police chief Chris Wagner.
"At this point, members of the Brotherhood began to hide personal belongings, essentially putting the well-being above the health fraternity Michael Deng," - Chief Wagner said.
It could not be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received some blunt trauma of the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families are affected by the rituals of initiation into the brotherhood, because at least one student killed by them every year since 1970," - he said in a statement Fayerberg Douglas, a lawyer representing the family of Deng.
Fraternities and their members should be held accountable, and this move by the government is very important.
Monroe County jury leaned in favor of the prosecution in the murder of the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will have the charge of violence against newcomer and conspiracy.
"We want to bring to justice not only the individual participants, but if there is an organization, which authorized all formally or informally, and then it" - said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned brotherhood and fraternity nationwide excluded from the structure of the local branch.
What happens when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates
Rate hike will happen, and the "bull market" stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
This we know.
What we do not know is how much time will pass before, and how long it will last.
Specifically, the story does not explain much about the time for the economy.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and by as much as 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and of financial assets.
Therefore, the administration of the Central Bank of the United States so strongly emphasizes that investors should not focus on when it will start to raise rates, and how many will take adaptation.
In fact, many variables in play.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss is about raising rates is exaggerated.
"The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis would inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of" cheap money ", - said Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics, in his commentary to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect that a gradual return in US interest rates to more normal but still low levels will wavelet, which many fear.
This does not mean, however, that the consequences will be.
Here's a look at how some might react to the economy, depending on the historical trends:
As already seen the market for the last month or so, the expectation of rate hikes could lead to instability at a time.
At higher rates, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It is unlikely that the proceeds from the shares slowed down to 12-24 months after the first jump, that is, again, likely reflecting the delay in monetary policy" - said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the results of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
More specifically, the market for the last about 35 years, often changing dramatically - about 14 percent - in the direction of raising the rates remain fairly steady for 250 days thereafter (average growth of 2.6 per cent), and then, after 500 days, returning to normal as an average yield of 14.4 percent over the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob Doll, chief equity trading strategies Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
The Deutsche say that the result for securities tends not immediately become more pronounced at the stage of raising rates, and stock returns begin to diminish.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often play them contribute.
In this case, the Federal Reserve raised in an environment that did not exist before, and can accelerate the recession.
In general, gross domestic product would be almost its lowest point during the existence of an increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 cases of rate hikes in 1950 only twice the nominal annual GDP was less than 4.5 percent.
Even though the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few believe that it is a long time, despite the fact that in the third quarter, he kept at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates at such an uncertain economic background can be risky and poses the question "whether this time is different," reported Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise interest rates by the Federal Reserve throughout the year, with their eyes fixed on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many experts on strategies and economists believe that the FOMC could approve a rate hike at this meeting, futures trading shows only 25 per cent probability.
"In our study, since 1950 all the cycles of rate hikes to date were in the super-cycle of increasing leverage with GDP, overlapping peaks, anticipating a recession very quickly after the start of recovery" - said in a statement.
By contrast, it was a very slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle at the moment - lengths that Fed waited for the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, often it lasts for 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market expects a rate hike, and this scenario is in some way similar to the one which is being implemented for the stock.
The principal difference is that in effect for faster nastupet bonds than for equities, when the Federal system changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds it seems that the yield changes vector immediately after the first increase / decrease in interest rates in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of rising interest rates fall bond yields immediately, "reports Deutsche.
Specialists from Charles Schwab strategy believe that the rate hike will lead to the fact that the profitability levels of long-term and short-term bonds will be brought together, making the curve flatter.
Bonds with high yield often behave better in this climate, but "we are still afraid of yield fluctuations," - the study says Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the policy of the Federal system.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and a drop in inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," - she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans rose, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market at a tightening policy of the Federal system.
Generally speaking, the company leading the main its business in the United States, will benefit from rising interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be in the worst position, because the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global marketplace, and their debt is more expensive - financially.
"History shows that the" quality "stocks above demonstrate the effectiveness of the market within three months after the initial rate increase," - said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report to clients.
Companies with stable financial condition cost the company an unstable state based on the results of each rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with a high return on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility also showed better performance than low-quality stocks, on average, 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
The debt will be a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of debt with floating rates will lose the most, according to Goldman.
Apart from the purely exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Investors could also see a profit through higher yields, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - Copy of Classic FM", - claims the Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Member of Parliament for the Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "lowering of standards"
It proves that it is becoming less and less distinguishable from a commercial competitor
It is also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award simply stripped from the Brits
A colleague in parliament Damien Collins that hit The Voice with the same criticism was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is converted into Classic FM", - said the leader of the members of parliament, prompting television and radio show that she does anything, do not do commercial companies.
Member of Parliament for the Conservative Andrew Bingham also said the leadership of the BBC, it seems that the public radio station "becomes stupid" and becoming less and less distinguishable from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I do not like to use the word" simplify "- but it seems it turns into Classic FM", - he said.
It is also aimed at the BBC Music Awards prize, launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which was launched last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - here are two examples that first come to mind in which you are actually only copy what is already on the market, "- said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director General denied the charges, claiming that the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music, and education audiences.
What do I know thanks to Radio 3, I do not know about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performance and music creation really can not be compared with anyone.
"It is also really important, I think Radio 3's interest in finding new music and promotion of new products", - he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey manager claimed that the radio station has to work much harder to attract the audience than in the past, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of the BBC, which has been subjected to attacks of stepping on the heels of the commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Member of Parliament from Tori Collins Damien attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that BBC bought the Dutch Talpa Media for an approximate price of 22 million pounds.
Do you see why this program is often discussed in connection with the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall argues that the BBC show 1, wherein the judges involved Paloma Faith and Boy George, was made in the "BBC typical style."
He added that he wants from the Corporation, so that she "found a hit in its own stable home" next time it will run entertainment project.
However, he did not consider it necessary to interfere with the order of the new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the license fee, on the other entertainment formats.
The growth of online sales slowed down as much as possible in August, and the reason for it may be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, an increase online sales by seven percent
The slowest growth was observed last month to as long as him began to watch in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that the November Black Friday could help to curb spending

Experts say that there are now signs online sales alignment, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at growth rates in previous years and will be back to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation", - he told the Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor IMRG sales index.
He explained that the online sales intensified three years ago, when buyers started to use their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so in all circumstances, for example, sitting on the couch.
But now it reaches a plateau, and you can see a decrease (increase).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which came from America, referred to as one of the causes of slow sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from shopping on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, the number of customers up to five times more than the average hastened to computers, to have time to take advantage of great deals, hit the most number of vendors websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter into a real battle for the bargain could get people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a little over £ 1 out of every 5 spent online.
With regard to goods such as TVs and washing machines, the more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online are more likely than in the fashion stores on the main streets.

As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in products for craftsmen, and at the same time to close 60 stores, warehouses B & Q.
Ms. Laurie said she would like to see more women in the staff stores B & Q, since eight out of ten purchasing decisions are made in the shop of the fairer sex.
Currently, most of the staff - men.
According to her, it is impossible not to notice and the latest demographic trends, characterized by the fact that a growing number of households consisting of single women who are more engaged in furnishing their homes than in the past.
Ms. Laurie said: "In our stores are still running mostly men.
Steps should be taken to achieve balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of decisions on purchase goods made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laurie - one of the five women standing at the helm of the UK's leading companies, whose shares are registered in the FTSE100 index - also changed the composition of the top management team, achieving among the directors of an equal number of men and women.
The Kingfisher - almost the only company in which exactly 50 per cent of managers - women, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms. Laurie said: "It was a conscious decision to diversify - is an important issue for us.
Find suitable women in the board of directors was not difficult.
Once the group has assumed the costs of closure of the shops, the Kingfisher company reported lower profits and sales for six months.
As a result of this trend Kingfisher, which owns brands Screwfix and B & Q, opens 200 new stores
Time making a decision on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching pursued by the Federal Reserve Bank meeting, which for two days discussed the adoption of major decisions - or not to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
The survey of 80 economists conducted to Reuters, revealed that just over half of those who have believed in the last week that the Federal Reserve is going on, now believe that he still will wait and keep interest rates at the current range of 0-0.25 percent .
This historic event, as it's been seven years since, as the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time we come to the fact that the main bank may move to zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates, "- said Angel Oubida, a senior fellow at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is working effectively, the economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Fed can not ignore how the decision will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that should be prepared for changes, but it speaks to their confidence in the fact that all odds are against such a move.
The solution will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees are in the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" - Chanting hundreds of refugees at the checkpoint Horgos on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Budapest Tuesday blocked the border for immigrants.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to feel out the other options of routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia is through Romania.
Another - in Croatia and Slovenia - Austria.
According to some reports, the buses that transported refugees from Serbia to Hungary, is now sent to the town of Shidu on the Croatian border.
Drivers were instructed by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa S. assured that his country is doing all it can to help the refugees, but its options are limited:
Our job is to protect Serbia as possible.
On the other hand, we also need to help these people, ensure humane attitude towards them.
But this is a European issue.
Solve it easy, no country in Europe can not cope alone with this, and the more such a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade asked Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not wish to remain in Serbia.
But the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is adamant:
If someone will be called a refugee in Serbia, he must complete the necessary documents.
And if he does not, then our country will not let him, because in Serbia is quite safe.
Hungary has already erected a 175-tikilometrovy fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban to stop there not intend he plans to build a similar fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with the European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Meimarakis for several years was a member of the center-right government, led, according to the left, to the financial crisis.
Now he became the interim leader of the party "New Democracy", defies Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with euronews journalist.
Euronews: Mr Meimarakis, welcome to euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing coalition SYRIZA, but now, judging by the polls, "New Democracy" caught up with her in popularity.
What has changed during this time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and we are too.
Mr. Tsipras many lied in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and economic growth prospects.
Now the country's budget deficit back and high unemployment.
Investors are gone because Mr. Tsipras drove them.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare promised with what actually happened.
Everyday life has become much worse in comparison with January, when the situation improved, and it concerned the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if he wins the election will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The fact is that, as we learned in the past few years, Greece can not move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where the act or are still working in the rescue program, the political forces and all the ruling parties got together in order to implement the program on which they agreed, without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions would enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favor of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and creditors of the country.
If on Monday you will become the new prime minister, will you carry out this agreement, or try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted in favor of the Greek movement on the European path, because it is well present, to some disastrous consequences would lead the country out of the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have the solidarity funds, Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would be lost if there was no agreement with Europe.
But the current austerity measures are the result of how Mr. Tsipras negotiated.
I know that Europe does not wish to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government during its first year in power wants to bring order to act efficiently and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the program of salvation, then, I'm sure all the commitments that are not can be made of the fact that they lead to a recession, may again become a subject of negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to assume that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our lenders, as they await the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their confidence, we need to continue privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed, continuing to benefit from EU funds and large investment opportunities, we need to discover a better understanding of and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of negotiations, the Government Tsipras failed to provide any serious arguments on many key political issues, what we found when discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can cite an example, related to the income of farmers.
We explained to our European partners that we are not talking about a fixed monthly income, and therefore it can not be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Tsipras ministers never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were unprepared and ill-informed, and therefore poorly negotiated and concluded an agreement unsuccessful.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon find yourself at a table with Mr Juncker, Hollande, Ms Merkel and other European leaders.
It will be different what you tell them, from what they say your predecessor Antonis Samaras?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that the end of 2014 we tried best to implement the agreement of 2012, the available bypassing sharp corners in it.
We have promoted the reform forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we have acted in an emergency.
The market has fallen, and there was no sign of potential buyers willing to pay the price, arrange the Greek government.
At that time I was the Speaker of Parliament, I have been able to reconcile the views of the three parliamentary groups constituted a majority government.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, and it is in the presence of the populists and extremists, as well as the mass demonstrations that took place outside.
And we were able to bring the country to a normal situation, which continued to improve, if the process was not interrupted by the early general elections, which resulted from the December presidential election.
Euronews: In recent weeks the massive flow of refugees moving through the territory of Greece.
What do you think about this situation, and the reaction of the European countries, which tend to these people?
Vangelis Meimarakis: refugee crisis - a time bomb, with which we have to deal with after the election victory.
And the reason is that SYRIZA government has not acted in this situation as they should.
In such matters should be proactive, because if the problem overtakes you, then there are only emergency measures.
And we are now precisely in such a situation.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZA, just seven days has done more than Mr. Tsipras made in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim government, which has provided valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, called for an EU summit will help find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice - the refugees are not illegal immigrants.
It is the victim of the war in Syria, the victim of some extraordinary events that have occurred to them.
This question has a deep humanitarian aspect, and we will stick to the position that European policy must take this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, to be involved and the United Nations.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and refugee reception centers.
We also need to effectively use the economic aid that we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this pressing issue.
Euronews: Mr Meimarakis, thanks for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.

The stars have lost their luck
Actor (left) in the photo with his son, Redmond (right), has gone through some difficult years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term companion Farrah Fawcett, who died of cancer.
Reportedly, the actor also suffered from addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All this, of course, played a role.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United was eliminated in several months because of a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a match of the Champions League, where Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven.
While going through a defender on this occasion, because of which will not be able to enter the field, at least for six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that the show will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during a reckless tackle by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw burst into the penalty area PSV.
He assisted on the pitch for nine minutes and were given oxygen before being taken away to the hospital.
Louis van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture and he is in the hospital."
He will be taken to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then will operate.
It's terrible - a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18 years, has overcome great difficulties and began to play fantastically, and then it happened.
In the locker room he was wearing an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it is six months, and the guy will not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope that he will be able to play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and has not been assigned a penalty.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish Mexican.
Louis van Gaal believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself, when I say that it is a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad tackle with two feet.
In his Twitter Shaw wrote: "Thank you all for your messages, words can not describe how devastated I was, my road to recovery begins, I will come back even stronger than it was."
More on the topic: Manchester United experiencing misfortune with Luke Shaw with the defeat in the game against PSV
In England defender will recover an additional incentive for the European Championships in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "This is a very serious injury."
When any player is eliminated with a similar injury, we are all very upset by this.
It was never the intention of our players - to injure the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when he played for Mexico against Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gaal in the World Cup 2014
"It is very difficult, because he had no intention to hurt the enemy, and when you hear that this is a very serious injury, you feel bad," - said Cocu.
I have not had the opportunity to see the very moment.
The only thing I could see was a ball that flew in the other direction, so that it looked as if he (Moreno) and touched him, but I did not see the tackle by Lucas.
In an interview with SBS6 Moreno said: "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to carry.
It is very difficult, and I'm sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
Is David Cameron knows about 'The Lorax "anything else?
Every parent quickly learns one thing: if your child is like some kind of book, it may take a little time before vybudete know it almost by heart.
Probably, unless you are David Cameron.
Responding to the representative of the company engaged in the organization of children's activities during the holidays, about their favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "The Lorax" - a story with an environmental slant, written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a commentary published on the company website SuperCamps, and continues: "This funny, touching, unusual story with a strong message, I love to read to their children, because it is always found some way or the message that we are missing. "
And everything is good, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the content of the book, but actually tells the story of the same movie, filmed in 2012, with new characters and details, we added to diversify the rather short original narrative.
"Surrounded by high walls of the city Vsemnuzhvill, where there was no greenery and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams, fulfilling her wish - to see a real tree" - we read in the text of the description of a love story , unknown to Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss's real name Geisel), who died in 1991.
If it looks enough suspicious Cameron text reads almost like a summary of the plot of the film "The Lorax", posted on the website Internet Movie Database: "Surrounded by the city Vsemnuzhvill where everything was high walls artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams. "
It seems unlikely that Cameron, as, admittedly, an active parent, so unfamiliar with the content of the book, which is not named for a boy learns how to destroy the environment greedy vyrubschik trees and knitter "vsemnuzhek" Nahodkins, despite the protests of The Lorax (whose name is rendered in the title of the book) - funny creature with a mustache, who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, such a simple PR-task was entrusted to the executor, never read a book about a child Lorax 20 times in a row.
Downing Street spokesman said that the text was allegedly received from the office of Cameron's constituency.
Company SuperCamps confirmed that the text has been received from the headquarters of Cameron, but further comments are not followed.
For Adam Lita clearly there was a risk not get to England, but it is still a difficult question
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates - a difficult task, but if you look at the team, which England has selected for this tour, the repetition of the defeat in the Test series 3-0, what happened last time does not seem likely to me.
I would also not rule out the victory in his field.
Alastair Cook's team, perhaps less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but there are players among batters, brilliantly taking twisted balls and collective thinking much; they do not bring with them the scars of 2012, and the only positive youth.
With the ball Moen Ali turns into a bowler, feeding balls twisted and Adil Rashid, even if it is an unknown figure to the test level, is an attacking option.
More on the topic: References Adam dropped out of the England cricket test and replaced by Alex Hales
Decision on exclusion of Adam Lita me, his head coach in "Yorkshire", of course, difficult to analyze.
In his seven Test matches we had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and obvious, but the harsh reality is that cricketers are evaluated by judges on the result.
There were questions about John Root, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said this before) it is best to choose the players themselves.
A pair of half honeycomb, and Lita could wait a long career, but he was at the mercy of their own destiny.
We hope that if he gets the most runs for the "Yorkshire", will be another opportunity.
England coach Trevor Bayliss, spoke well of his attitude, even when he did not show what I was capable of, and it does not surprise me; it is primarily a team player, and then everything else.
The question is, how long it will take before the test cricket batsman leave the impression of - a complicated question.
Lit played in seven games, as well as Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton - nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play his on a foreign field.
The only thing you could complain about - the fact that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity in the past.
Appears Alex Hales and he betsman, which I value highly.
He unpredictable cricketer, what we have seen in the Yorkshire club earlier this season, when he made 236 in a match against us on the court Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should have at least given the same opportunity as those who came before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea to put Moena near Cook as an opening batsman, that would make it possible to introduce an additional spinner, while maintaining high-speed four bowlers, pondered, and I'm not against it.
I do not see the reasons on which the kicker may not be there to hit the ball, and the left-hander has already shown that he is a hell of a good cricketer.
Moen, may not be exactly what you need for your Worcestershire County, but became the third number for them, and there is a big difference here.
My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches, "the third batsman", before leaving as the opening in 2001.
He won three hundred immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a reserve spinner, and my non continuous dialogue with him, he seemed like a very promising young man.
People can look at his stats approximate - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think that it is a risky bet, but among spinners voting "for" a little bit, and selects the chosen youth.
He learned a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
Appointment of Mechlin Dzhayauordina, Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the test matches, it might be a master stroke.
He is one of the best guys for the game, which will bring it a wealth of experience gained in all conditions and in all attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the ball is white, and will provide both energy and relentless pace in the setup.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it a game or coaching, and how Mechlin, has considerable intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the locker room, even if they say what has been said before, can give new strength team.
Collie team colleague Ben Stokes of Durham left to-night, Ruta granted a similar break in communication with Australia, and I, for one, do not feel about this problem.
While not everyone will agree with this, coaches and those select players, do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to accept.
The camp is the UK release of supporters of the EU can win, if the economy is in a depression in 2017
Inadequate policy of David Cameron for the resumption of negotiations on the preservation of the UK in the EU every day experiencing more and more problems, even without regard to the election of genius Dzheremi- "It's yes or no?" - Corbin leader of the Labour Party or TUC resentment of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbina and Nigel Farage.
Friendly European diplomat explained the other day that at the position in which the EU is, experiencing various crises - not all of them are self-made - some member countries are fed up with the British self-centered agenda divisive concessions and undermining the agreement changes, which they basically do not want to.
Gathered in Brighton for the annual meeting, the TUC has decided that he does not want them in any way, if they destroy social security.
We might even call it "program selfie Dave and George."
Premier and Minister of Finance and ride on the summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographed themselves on the background of the famous local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or not, then come home and say that they attract allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants interested in maintaining external contacts Britain under the awning of the European Union - "Do not leave us, together with France," says Berlin - suggests that zashorennye ministers and officials in some capitals have reached an understanding that they will not care stay or we leave.
Angela Merkel, very careful German Chancellor - ally, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the room before the situation worse for her as she deteriorated to sat up in his place Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Nick (16).
The head of France Francois Hollande faces a re-election or replacement in 2017.
It also becomes invalid.
Poland may soon get a right-wing nationalist government, Spain - left.
It's hard to see them climbing out of their way to help "selfie-shaving", whose energy could be spent on the prevention of exit of Scotland from the United Kingdom - which they also did not want to, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can even schedule the issuance of deliberately unhelpful remarks in SNP style during the referendum campaign in the UK in 2017 to spur the British exit from the EU process, suggests my friend.
"The revision was obsession" and "Britain has not received anything of value from the resumed negotiations."
The Europeans had the misfortune to know how a predator can be Fleet Street, and how skeptical towards the EU set up a media tycoons, unlike during Launched Tony Benn referendum in 1975, which supported our accession in 1973, the ratio of 2: 1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the inveterate Euro-opportunist, famous for his "direct EU banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
For all its folly Ed Milliband knew who his enemies.
They included a motley group of thieves afraid of taxes, telephone hackers, intruders and pseudo-non-residents, who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was about them quite the same opinion, but was aware that when you are in a cage with wild gorilla, you have to give her a banana, to distract her and give her to eat you for lunch and again with tea.
Upon Miliband was more adherent Blair than Blair himself in opposition to the idea of a referendum about Cameron as Blair sacrifice principles in favor of the canceled EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him the winning ticket.
Press any of that he does not forgive.
But Milyaga Jeremy Corbin, who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he no longer has the time to spend it on me - it seems that risks repeating the strategy Kinnock Neil "Boycott Murdoch '80s - a mistake and then and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy for interaction with the press - not me, but definitely with Andrew Marr, on whose couch he was sitting in the BBC on Sunday.
The official position of Corbin in Europe - this is what I call evolution delicately.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside tradiotsinalistskoy trends Ukip and the broader "small England supporters" among the Tories can probably say this "yes".
This is the same that Hilari- "Benn, but Benita" -Benn said on radio and television this week, while his inner scout struggling refused to accept that the appointment of John McDonnell Corbin obnoxious "shadow" minister of finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's, when his old father struggled fought on TV for disloyalty to colleagues in the Labour cabinet, without going too far and not losing his position in the Cabinet.
Battle Hilary was more attractive.
But the struggle for to stay "under any circumstances" - the phrase Benn - not that, McDonnell said, and not what JK said peers and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night, according to popular belief..
Whatever the Democrat and wanted to tell "your guy" Corbin - remember, he even touched me - the discipline of messages is important in the age of television around the clock seven days a week, especially in the maelstrom of social networking, the focus of paranoia and betrayal.
This is reasonable - not give Cameron so easy to get rid of Europe, allowing it to take for granted the support of the Labor Party during the referendum campaign, as the McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the fundamental fallacy McDonnell and Corbin about the membership in the EU - under the "bennitskoy" siege economy - is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among leftist dissidents, whose narcissism generated slight difference is a central principle in the dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JK It will not agitate for a way out - foreign diplomats will be required to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why Paris or Berlin to spend the political capital - they too have suspicious voters - concessions to Britain, where anything can be meaningless?
The US has a very disappointed by weak British military operations in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory government in power to cut spending, as I was reminded on Monday at lunchtime on some forum titled British Influence Security.
Experts criticized the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
Statements by the Government-funded agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking, voiced at a meeting of 12 people, some of which are associated with the tobacco industry, the researchers reported.
Experts, are published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), together with the Lancet criticized the evidence used by the agency Public Health England (PHE) in its report on the e-cigarette.
PHE published an important report - "turning a milestone" in the last month, calling it "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to some experts link with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal The Lancet last month criticized the "extremely shaky argument," on the basis of which PHE has built its main conclusions.
In the BMJ article, two researchers wondered whether these statements for a "firm or flimsy grounds".
Martin McKee, professor of European public health organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Keypvell, teacher of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of health care - the rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
According to them, the public expects to PHE statement that "current best estimate indicates that electronic cigarettes by about 95% less harmful than smoking" were based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, it is derived from a single meeting, 12 people gathered for the development of multicriteria analysis model of decision-making in order to summarize their views about the harms associated with different-nicotine products; results of the meeting are summarized in scientific publications.
McKee and Keypvell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, on whose Director General reported that he had previously received funding from the British American Tobacco for independent study.
He also confirmed BAT certificates in the health sector in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting, announced funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, not to mention about the financing, he is reported to have previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the choice of board members was provided, but among them there are several well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which are also stated in the financing of industry publications.
It is not known whether the other participants in the meeting management experience in the tobacco business.
The meeting also visited the head of the tobacco in the direction of PHE.
The scientific article, published a group, "gracefully agrees" that there is a lack of "compelling evidence of harmful effects of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Keypvell.
However, none of these ties and restrictions were not affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Keypvell told that PHE statements that "at present there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, resulting in children or non-smoking" are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and wellbeing in the PHE, said that the statements of BMJ previously given answers.
He said: "The electronic cigarette is much less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifetime smokers die from their addiction.
All the evidence imply that the health risks from electronic cigarettes are relatively low, but we must continue to explore the long-term consequences.
In PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what and what not to prove prove this evidence, especially where the public had doubts about the relative hazard compared to tobacco.
About 80 000 people a year die from diseases related to smoking, and smoking costs the NHS £ 2bn a year.
Clearly indicated the obvious - that although the electronic cigarettes are not safe, they applied only to part of the harm caused by smoking - we carry out our tasks to the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 believes that the BBC should stop series EastEnders
The former head of Channel 4's Luke Johnson said that the BBC should stop issuance programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would kill for such successful shows as a soap opera about "Albert Square".
Johnson noted that license fees should only be used to create programs that are not available in other British television and radio companies.
He spoke with the BBC criticized for the fact that the company puts the transmission of public broadcasting, which probably looks just a small part of the audience, at the peak air time when competitors are shows with high ratings, and on such channels as BBC4.
After the BBC director general Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said that he at one time during the six years of unsuccessfully trying to establish cooperation with the BBC during operation on Channel 4.
"I can not help thinking that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcasts that could show the competing companies not receiving subsidies," - said Johnson, members of the Communications Committee of the House of Lords within the BBC determine the further destiny.
If you save the license fee, that I do not find a good solution in the medium and long term, the company should leave the air only those programs that are not available and are not going to be produced by other companies.
Show The Voice airs in prime slot, because the creators want to get the best possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else did not show, ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I do not understand why the regressive taxes should go to finance programs that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice - one such example, EastEnders - another; It is generally known that they own production.
Other channels, no doubt, many would have given for it.
I do not understand how it can be public broadcasting.
I do not think that it somehow would diminish the BBC.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, head of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC in the pursuit of ratings, "because employees ambitions and because of their belief that it is the best way to get support for the long term."
His comments on the most popular show on BBC echo the comments of the Executive Director of the Sky Tony Boll, who in his memory McTaggart Lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, offered to sell the BBC EastEnders type series.
Johnson noted that a niche transmission BBC public nature "continue to go on BBC4, where it is often impossible to estimate the audience, but the function of the company is made, and it can be presented as an argument in the sanctimonious sermons justifying the income from license fees 4 billion. £ "well, yes, of course, we are doing all these weird transmission that no one is watching."
They put them in the slot, where no one will ever look at them.
With regard to the license fee Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system with regard to who most of it will get.
Of course, you think, we all think that £ 150 a year - a huge sum, but for the people for whom 150 pounds - a lot of money, I wonder, they think so because they do not really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former executive director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elsteyn channels, which also appeared before the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should reconsider the mission of Rita to "inform, educate and entertain".
He noted that currently only a small part of the materials produced by BBC formally classified as educational - in his words, it is 1% of television content and 0.1% on the radio - and that the company has taken the initiative of the Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "inform, educate and entertain. "
For partnership Elsteyn noticed that the BBC should make greater efforts in such areas as "Proms" (only some of them, according to him, is shown on TV), as well as to enter into alliances with the commercial broadcasters, to make them available to view online.
"Sonogenetika" allows you to control brain cells using sound waves
On the video you can see how the nematodes change direction at a moment when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have deduced genetically modified worms with the nervous system, which can be controlled using the existing momentum of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction at a moment when they are exposed to a sound pulse is too high that the human ear could hear them.
The pulses have an effect through the activation of neurons are genetically modified to use membrane channels that are responsive to ultrasonic waves.
More on the topic: Researchers controlled brain activity with light
Scientists said that the worms demonstrate the possibility of a new technique called "sonogenetika", the essence of which is the use of ultrasound for the excitation of certain cells in the brain, heart and muscles, and the ultrasound source is located outside the body.
Srikanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, California, told the Guardian, that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which the human brain sends electrical impulses and is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Nematode worms typically do not respond to ultrasound, Chalasani but found that they begin to react when they are placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the vesicles increase the ultrasonic waves that enter the body and then the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called "ion channels TRP-4" detected in the cell membranes of some worms.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels open and stimulate the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by means of ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of worms so that their motor neurons using TRP-4 ion channels.
During the application of ultrasound to influence Modified Organisms sound waves amplified microscopic bubbles injected into the body of worms modified by activating motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in "optogenetics" - a new direction, which allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light pulses.
Chalasani claims that compared with sonogenetika this method may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the correct area of the brain over fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass freely through the tissues of the body, so for their delivery does not need to go inside the cranium.
"We believe that the treatment of certain neurological diseases in clinical use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can in the time to make human neurons are sensitive to ultrasonic signal", - said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to the muscle, and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements mock British arms trade
Watch the video Amnesty International protested against the exhibition of arms.
Stunning drones killer!
Destructive shin iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric stun batons, causing unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
A cheerful voice and drawn animation, leave no doubt that this ad is the largest international exhibition of arms - caustic parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the intention of the British government "push" repressive regimes weapon, using passing in the center ExCeL in the Docklands exhibition of defense technology and systems security.

But special campaign also leads to the sudden emergence of many posters at bus stops and subway trains that need to see them again.
"Important Announcement riding on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" - It is written on one of the fonts of the London Underground with the image of DLR line turns into a silhouette of the tank.
In September this year a crowd of arms dealers was coming on line DLR. Passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters painted by artists who exhibited their works in the "Museum of ill-design" in the park Banksy "Dismalend".
The team called the Group "special patrol" helped spread them around London, using "set the burglar advertising spots', 6-pound set of wrenches, which, as stated," gives access to approximately one third of advertising space at bus stops of the planet. "
Transport workers in London sadly from this "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of parody ads, issued by the "special patrol".
According to Gavin Grindona, curator of the exhibition Cruel Designs and a teacher at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and seek to ensure that the political art to convey to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists are beginning to work with activists protest movements, knowing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of his art, if they want to influence society.

Video of Amnesty has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by the agency VCCP, working pro bono, with the assistance of a graphic designer and the actor dubbing, also working for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was struck by the silence of the advertising around the arms of the exhibition - with a pass at ExCel calendar - and thought: "Let's give them a campaign, they are trying to avoid."
They thought a more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but "to fill her home with bright colors and animation was more exciting occupation."
"They are incredibly helped us draw attention to the illegal sale of the torture equipment on display," - says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
Now we need to the UK government to take action and guarantee that it will not be a torture equipment sold illegally right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art exhibition on the theme of arms comes from inside the ExCeL, where bidders evfemesticheskoy fantastic products.

Eight golden rules of accommodation in student dormitories
It has passed 11 years since I moved into the student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old man who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but now I think of forced smiles of those I irritated - and numerous, long complaints of the other .
Basically, what I have learned, it can be expanded by eight simple rules.
Transfer to the hostel may vary slightly from acting on the nerves to absolutely frightening.
It encourages the chat: tell people where you are, whether you're a sabbatical and where it held, whether you support Corbin took and why you "honestly, neither love nor hate" Marmite ", because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract hAHAHA, I'll be in. "
Take rest.
And help others to rest, too - ask questions and show interest.
It supports the conversation and helps you to find the people that you like, rather than those with which you did not even have to talk, even if you lit up the eyelashes, and they would be distributed fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
Rooms people often turn to drinking establishments, cinemas and late-night partying place overall, but they are also a place where people dress up and corrected underwear.
More on the topic: Do not even think to start their studies at the university, being in a relationship
For introverts are unfair in universities.
Your room should be a haven, but many hostels form culture vacillation from one room to another, which promotes friendship, fellowship and leads to a long friendly relations.
It can be a living hell for someone who is trying to restore power.
Nothing in the culture does not allow you to say: "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I was able to restore the energy I spent on communication with you."
Try to feel tired when fellow student communication - and not knocking him, and to send SMS.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
One guy in my dorm followed this principle: if the door was not locked, then he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends with the help of baking.
As you start university life at the peak of the popularity of the show Bake-Off, then knock on the door for people to introduce themselves and to present a plate of chocolate chip cookies - not such a strange effect, it is not reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we are neighbors I you something baked, and now smile, and I'll ask you a personal question. "
Offering homemade treats - a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to chat with you, and as a result, probably, your face will associate them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on whether you are a good baker.
Poor lumps stuck together flour, sugar and fat will make people more likely to pretend to be asleep when you're knocking them.
Stealing food - a typical crime in dormitories.
Of course, the appropriation of someone else's chicken - stealing, but is it theft - take a little bit of milk for tea?
Check with the owner of the milk.
Most likely he will offer you not ashamed, even if the inside is boiling with rage.
If kto-to steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you - but try to take it more mature than my neighbor, who poured in their milk dishwashing liquid to avenge those who took it without permission.
She is now in jail.
You must not make a noise that would interfere with people to sleep or study.
Not only to be a decent man, but because you are the people of the saying about the glass house.
Girl in the hallway asked my neighbor turn down the sound of drum and bass, because it was 3 am, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor turned up the volume.
When he finally stopped at 5 am, she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours, and then the cut the music and shut the door behind him, going on a three-hour exam.
Not whether it was romantic, if your future husband lived in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, there would be an extremely up biting elbows awkwardly, if you took a neighbor of his future wife, was fascinated by him, broke off relations and would have to see him every day, and it is possible to watch as he pulls on his side all your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart can not command - but if the hot neighbor definitely not your future spouse, try to slightly cool the ardor of its own.
In the exciting moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside his own locked room, and the drawing of the line between bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good joke - it's fun, but it turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach valuable and interesting safety lesson hiding something - but never get dirty someone's room, toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and someone else put down the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in a freezer - but not other people's things glued glue Blu-Tack to the ceiling more than two times.

Washington responded to the Russian military activity by a phone call.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
According to him, the military support that Moscow has President Assad, only leads to escalation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about it with his Russian counterpart, PJ Media wrote.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia Sergey Lavrov, to discuss Russian military activity in Syria.
This was reported by PJ Media Edition.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that the continued support of President Assad from Russia poses a risk of exacerbation and prolongation of the conflict and a negative impact on our common goal - the fight against extremism - if we do not continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict by direct transfer of power ", - said representatives of the US State Department.
They also noted that Kerry reiterated the US commitment to the fight against "Islamic state" in the framework of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be able to be a member.
In addition, the United States "will be happy to Russia's constructive role in trying to resist the" Islamic State "".
On Friday, White House officials said they do not know exactly what actions are taken by the Russian troops in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, a spokesman for the White House Josh Ernest said that the time for a phone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the President determines that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he raises the phone and try to make this call. "
Sam Barack Obama said Russia's decision to increase the support for the Assad regime "a losing bet."
I remember our conversation with Mr Putin for four or five years ago, when I told him it was a mistake, that the continued support of Assad only worsen the situation.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and as a result the situation has worsened", - said the US president.
Imported yachts exempt from customs duties.
Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily release the imported yachts and other vessels for leisure and sports from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes in the list of preferential goods for temporary admission have been prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Russian government.
This "News" said Assistant Minister for Economic Development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the results of his trip to Crimea instructed a number of departments - Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Emergency Situations, Federal Security Service, Federal Customs Service, Rosturizm - to prepare proposals for the creation of favorable conditions for sailing in coastal zones of the country.
In turn, the experts say that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, servicing and maintenance of yachts.
The owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - about € 200 million annually goes into the coffers of the European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
Russian Economic Development Ministry has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On Amendments to the list of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes", and provides a complete conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes on imported yachts and other craft leisure and sports.
According to the ministry, it will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, - said Lashkina.
This issue was brought before the subcommittee on customs tariff, non-tariff regulation, the protective measures in foreign trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, the meeting which was held in September, and on the basis of the discussion was also approved by the authorities.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure to full conditional exemption on importation is inherently privilege.
Therefore, after the approval of the subcommittee meeting minutes in the Russian Federation Ministry of Economic Development will make a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission to discuss with the states - members of the EAEC, explained Lashkina.
The list of imported goods, which are fully exempt from customs duties and taxes, includes goods necessary to facilitate foreign trade and international co-operation, for use in the field of science, culture, film, sport and tourism, to provide international assistance and others. Among the them - service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), instrumentation, drilling equipment, costumes and sets, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skiing, race cars, motorcycles, racing craft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and items for religious ceremonies.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation "Izvestia" was told that produced binding decisions on sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Yevpatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for registration of entry and exit of small, sport sailing and pleasure boats in a sea port.
Transport Ministry were instructed captains Crimea sea ports to ensure the application of a simplified procedure for small-size sunset, sport and pleasure craft sailing to the port and the output of these ships seaport.
Also, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian government prepared draft regulations on the approval of the boundaries of the waters of sea ports in Crimea.
In respect of Yalta and Feodosia orders have already been adopted, others are in the stage of approval, - the press-service of the department.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state supervision, classification and certification, state registration in respect of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes should carry Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia is extremely difficult to yachting because of poor infrastructure.
If you look to the south of France and Italy, there is a whole industry is constantly evolving, in which a large number of people involved.
In Russia, virtually all stand still.
Our coast of little interest, only one piece, which can be operated year-round yacht - is the Black Sea near Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the biggest challenge is that in this area is extremely strict rules Border Service: to go for a walk on a yacht, you need to draw a lot of permits.
Moreover, in Russia there is no place to refuel the yacht even.
Two days it can go with its fuel, and then there is a problem, where can I get, - says Director of Sales Company Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
As for places to store the boat, then in Moscow and Saint Petersburg have special hangars for boats up to 30 m. It is also sent to the boat storage in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov said that the yacht buyers - wealthy people, but with the beginning of the crisis has decreased demand for yachts.
The World Bank has provided Ukraine a loan of $ 500 million.
The World Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $ 500 million on the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The new funding will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine", - said in a statement.
World Bank Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Tsimyao Fan said that banking sector reforms will help to revive credit in the real economy and will stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank observed the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems Fan urges the Ukrainian government to speed up reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved a loan of € 100 million in Ukraine, according to "RIA Novosti".
Prisons are asked to create separate units for transgender people.
On the Public Council under the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of prisoners in October 2015, among other issues, discuss the possibility of establishing colonies in separate blocks for transgender people and transvestites.
This "News" said board member Vladislav Grib.
According to him, depending on the total number of prisoners in Russia, have not decided on the floor, in the local prison is possible to provide separate cells, blocks, or even (if such criminals will be many) in the long term to create a special colony transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that determined on the departure of the punishment of citizens in such isolated places is possible only after the convicted will appropriate medical expertise that will prove that the offender is indeed a man identifying himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib sure that transgender isolation from other prisoners serving sentences will ensure safety.
According to him, the proposed practice successfully operates abroad in jail (where the accused are before the court decision), there are separate chambers for transgender people, and in prisons - special blocks.
Today it is the only way out when dealing with such criminals.
Definitely they need to be isolated, as the presence of transvestites and transsexuals in the normal cells is dangerous for them, it is the suffering of their families and the sea problems for the FSIN staff.
Humiliation trance by fellow inmates are guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how a large city, as offenders with indeterminate sex, need and expect, where to distribute them.
Prison individual definitely not necessary - only the camera units in prisons.
Yes, a private colony is possible if there will be many transgender.
As Mushroom explained, may contain 50 or 100 people in the unit, and if a special body will be set up in the Russian one, then come to the departure of punishment prisoners transsexuals will be able to get from any of the regions.
The citizens are in jail at the place of commission of the crime, so the income transvestites or transsexuals in other subjects during the investigation and trial are not real, but to introduce the practice to have already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - said fungus.
Recall, on the eve of the law enforcement authorities could not decide in which the detention facility - male or female - to determine arrested for drug possession 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukova (known as Alina Davis), because of what a man with a maiden appearance arrested was not.
He was released home on bail.
The news was widely discussed in social networks and the media, as the content of the mechanism of transgender people in jail and the colonies in Russia really is not.
Russian human rights activist LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for punishment transgender, noting that abroad also possible to detect people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own desires.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as well as the issue of providing security prison for homosexuals - said Alekseev.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be done in the name of and for the homosexuals, especially because of their prison more than transgender.
This Alekseev doubts that Russia will be a lot of people who are ready to pass himself off as transceksualov in order to get into other than normal colony.
Of course, you can enter a medical examination before being put people in prison for transgender people, but not always is clearly.
For example, in the US, one of the prisoners Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and in jail said he wanted to change their sex, - said Alekseev.
A person may feel anyone.
But while certain places to serve sentences for transgender people do not have, I doubt that prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such persons, and to delve into the intricacies of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze said that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transgender-criminals in the colony can greatly delay the start of sentence convicts.
A commission - is a matter of human sexuality, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, it is not a test, which is based on highly accurate conclusion.
Today the possibility of psychiatry permit.
Therefore, potential patients before the sex change are always such expertise - they just indicate whether the change of sex with surgery necessary measure - said Lordkipanidze.
However, I find it difficult to imagine how to implement this system in relation to convicts, as an average of the survey takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that the whole idea of creating a separate unit for the transgender support, also doubts that the current economic conditions, it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new facilities, medical examinations, - transgender identity in Russia.
Calculate difficult, there is no official statistics, but given that homosexuals in Russia about 5%, we can say that transgender people even less, and those who have such a deviation and even commit crimes, do a small amount, - Lordkipanidze said.
Now at the request of the prison administration to homosexuals, transgenders and so can get individual conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk ended World Chess Championship among juniors up to 20 years.
The ending of the championship has stood out more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and they became Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to still catch the Pole Krzysztof Jan-Doudou, who seems to be confident going to the title.
The girls celebrated the victory Ukrainian chess player Natalia Books.
World Chess Championship, which was held in early September in Khanty-Mansiysk, the middle of the tournament race, seemed to have lost almost the whole affair, as the representative of Poland Jan Krzysztof Duda, issued a series of four wins (competitions are held on the Swiss system in 13 rounds) , confidently took the lead.
Given that Duda was the rating favorite of the championship, and generally considered to be one of the most promising young players, the likelihood that he will miss the extracted break, it seems to be very low.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed Russian citizen Mikhail Antipov close the gap to just 0.5 points, it remains clear favorite for the title.
After Antipov, to catch up with the leader, it was necessary to certainly win in the 13th round.
But even that would not have helped his party win Duda.
Plus, it's a must-win, of course, could have an impact on the game of Russian chess player and cause unnecessary errors.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Rambaldi Francesco, and then had to wait until the party completes Duda met with Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately for Antipova Polish chess player he brought a confrontation with the Dutchman in a draw.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipova were the best additional indicators.
And because it is the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug Governor Natalia Komarova which traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, it awarded the grand prize.
But in the girls competition intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalie Buchs (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the final round, she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russians Alina Bivol not let her catch up with the Bucs.
Russian athlete remained second with a lag of champion in the 0.5 points.
VimpelCom changing regional structure.
The company combines the Volga and Ural regions in the enlarged one of the Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - in the East region.
The project will be completed by November 1.
As the CEO of "VimpelCom" Mikhail Slobodin, the changes are carried out to "remain a strong player in the market," the company develop "new, not always favorable external conditions."
In an interview with TV channel "Russia 24" Mr. Slobodin said that they intend to reduce Russia's "ten percent" of staff.
Rospotrebnadzor checked 78 Moscow eateries Burger King and issued 367 orders.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volokolamsk highway fined 50 thousand. Rub., And establishment of the Grand Tula street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after the elimination of all violations.

Comfortable for investkredita rate - 10-13%.
According to experts, the credit market for small and medium-sized enterprises in January-April this year, dipped by 40%.
What do you estimate the situation today?
After the end of 2014 panic moods - early 2015 SME lending volume declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp rise in interest rates.
Lending under the 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
Previously the bank could lay in the increased rate of all your potential problems in the future, from delinquency to the defaults, but now it can not be done: and so exorbitant rates.
For the current business rates on SME loans it is uncomfortable.
For a large part of the investment projects of the current level is not acceptable in terms of payback.
The level of rates in the 10-13% would have allowed businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns for them.
How do you estimate is satisfied business demand for loans?
After lowering the Central Bank interest rate situation has improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients began applying for loans is much less common.
First of all, the business does not understand the perspectives of its development and future earnings.
Today, the business one way: you must learn to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to more closely monitor the current results, control the movement of funds.
At the same time the availability of financial resources is to use new technologies to upgrade their equipment, reduce production costs and energy supply.
All this ultimately allows the company to make products more competitive and to keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the SME lending market will be strengthened and will affect its development until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast reduction in the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator demonstrates consistency in lowering the key rate.
However, the radical fall of prices of credits should not wait for SMEs.
In the current situation, the problem in the first place, is inflation, which makes the need to raise interest rates for real income.
In addition, the cost of money will remain high even at lower rates in the Central Bank of Russia.
If we talk about the level of delay, the traditional small and medium-sized businesses, the limited opportunities in the replenishment of funds as well as in cases of economic behavior correction, will certainly be a greater risk for lenders.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the proportion of bad loans.
The main reason - the international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy.

Revenue FedEx is mixed, reduced forecasts for 2016
FedEx reported on the disappointing results of the last quarter, and reduced service delivery giant forecast annual profit due to falling demand for freight services and the increase in costs in its division of land transport.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent on the prior trading 45 minutes before the opening of the stock exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. It said it expects to earn between $ 10.40 to $ 10.90 for the fiscal year, which ends next May, which is 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $ 10.84, according to FactSet survey.
Reduced forecast observed in spite of the rise in interest rates by an average of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and rising charges for land transport of heavy or bulky cargo, which begins in November.
The company said it still plans to revenue growth compared to the previous year due to the reduction of costs, increase in gross income and the growth of online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "has worked steadily in view of the weak, compared with the forecast economic conditions, particularly in production and world trade."
Plans for the hiring of labor holidays were announced the next day after the statement of a competitor, UPS, that they are planning to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same as taking a job in the past year.
For the quarter that ended Aug. 31, the FedEx earned US $ 692 million, 6 percent higher than a year earlier.
Earnings per share amounted to 2.42 dollars, close to the average forecast of $ 2.44 per share, conducted by Zacks Investment Research poll of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased 5%, to 12.3 billion. Dollars.
Six analysts surveyed by the Zacks, expected 12.23 billion. Dollars.
FedEx has suffered in recent years by the downturn in the sector of urgent international shipments, which led to a lack of growth in the gross income of its subsidiaries express freight.
However, the boom in internet shopping greatly improved results in the FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter of revenues from land transport increased by 29%, but operating income remained largely unchanged due to increased costs for large origin and self-insurance.
Division Express shipments received higher revenue due to higher base rates, while in the cargo sector income fell because of higher labor costs.
In the pre-auction about an hour before the opening of the stock exchange FedEx shares fell $ 3.85, or 2.5 percent - up to $ 150.15.
They closed Tuesday, having fallen 11 percent over the year and 17 percent below the record of 11 June.
In the most anticipated for several years the meeting the heads of the Federal Reserve will hold two days of this week for the 27-foot table in Honduran mahogany, deciding whether to raise its key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade's time.
At one end of the ornate meeting rooms height of two floors above them will hang Wall picture of the United States.
This map - a reminder of the fact that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The central bank received a double mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal system recognized that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this is the third order may be an unknown factor in the predicted almost a decision that will be announced on Thursday, on whether the US economy is ready to get off the unprecedented stimulus provided by near-zero short-term interest rates since late 2008.
Even though most of the data show strong growth, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could keep the already cautious head of the federal system by adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even as few as a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labor market and inflation will become the first and most important consideration", - said M. Lindsay Pegza, chief economist at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise interest rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to give them an excuse to wait on," - she said.
There is no consensus about what to do with the Federal Reserve System, which itself provokes a fluctuation of the financial market.
Approximately half of the economists recently polled Bloomberg, expected interest rate rise this week.
Financial markets, however, expect that the federal system of this hold out, despite the fact that the key indicator shows only about 30-percent chance of a rapid rise.
This can lead to a drop in the stock market, if the federal system will raise the rate, provided that those who make the decisions, not soften the blow a promise that the next increase will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
Take-off was triggered by expectations that the person defining the strategy of the Federal system, will leave rates this week - said John Lonskaya, group chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It will be a surprise if the federal system will raise rates at this time", - he said.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve will do so, "they will have to go too far in adopting its strategy to keep the financial markets in the hands, so they do not panic."
Other experts argued that the rate increase would calm financial markets, as it will remove the uncertainty about how it will act in the federal system.
Just a month ago the Federal system, it seems inclined to lift rates by 0.25% this month, taking the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions, which would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer, she expects a rate hike this year, despite the complaints of the liberals that need more economic progress.
Although the emergence of new jobs in August slowed down the growth of the labor market has been stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest level in more than seven years, and almost at that level, which is in the federal system is considered full employment.
Wage growth is showing signs of acceleration.
And, while inflation continues to be lower than planned by the central bank's annual target of 2%, the leadership of the Federal system stated that the key reason was the temporary effect of the sharp drop in oil prices.
Economy "can cope with higher interest rates, and in need of them, taking into account the reduction of the labor market," - said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
Average Dow Jones shares of industrial companies fell by as much as 16% compared to the record high value in May, as investors worried that the slowdown of the Chinese economy may slow down global growth.
The market partly recovered its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now approximately 10% below the May high values.
For the management of the Federal Reserve System of the market disturbance further complicates the difficult calculations term interest rate increase.
"In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks they would have to tighten the screws at this meeting," - said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former employee the Federal reserve system.
Now, he predicted, they would wait at least a month to get more control over the effects.
"There is great uncertainty about what might be the consequences for the US economy, as they have almost no reliable data after the recent events in China," - Oliner said.
global economic health is not included in the main concern of the Federal system, and technically it should not be taken into consideration when making these decisions.
But essentially the Federal Reserve began a world financial power.
Influence of the Central Bank was huge in recent years.
One only a hint of the then Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve may "dampen" our monetary expansion caused market turmoil around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, one with each other would be expected that the heads of the Federal Reserve System will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also to consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy .
Their decision-making process - "more of an art than a science," - said Zachary Carabelli, head Envestnet Inc - a company that is engaged in global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve System were cases of over-reacting to movements of the financial markets, which do not seem related to the economic principles."
Lacker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee insists on raising rates, as an example the solutions of 1998-99.
The Asian financial crisis led to the fact that the federal system has lowered its key interest rate at 0.75% for the three meetings, "in spite of the limited identifiable consequences for growth in the US", - said Lacker.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System abolished the reduction.
The Federal Reserve System should be put in the first place concern for the stability only in times of great crisis, such as a market crash in 2008, "- said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee for the establishment of the interest rate in the Bank of England.
Last panic and come close to that level, he said.
"You would, of course, did not want to be in a situation where you are afraid of growth rates due to the fact that the markets are going through a shock," - said Posen, president of the Institute of World Economics. Peterson.
The law of the Federal Reserve still has a dual mandate, and does not mention financial stability, and as long as it does not change, I do not think they need to stay ahead of the event.

He said this, speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.

Ponaslazhdatsya victory a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergei Shubenkova.
He succeeded in his favorite distance 110 meters hurdles win at the European Team Championship, set several records, and most importantly - to become world champion, and the first in the history of the national sprint barrier.
In addition, recently the athlete won the final stage of the "Diamond League", finishing in third place overall.
"New News" asked Shubenkova share impressions of the past season.
Sergei, the season is not over yet for you?
Yes, I am going to speak at the World Military Games, which will be held October in Korea, and then I'll think about the rest.
However, now I will be prepared at home, in Barnaul, and to be at home - it is still very different state.
All better than to wander around the world every week.
You once said that Autumn - a favorite time of year for you.
End of August, beginning of September - the perfect time.
Passion after the main otkipeli start of the season, the burden of responsibility is no longer presses.
You can compete in fun, to "rasslabone".
Plus, you know that and leave very soon ...
And fatigue is?
Still, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions ...
Fatigue at the end of the season is always stored.
And then it does not matter what he was doing more - won or lost.
Each race - it's stress.
Regular flights, transfers - all this does not go to the body without a trace.
Tired physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, is on the rise.
Why are there - I'm just happy!
By the time the finish at the World Championships in Beijing, come back often?
It happens.
And you, the journalists, do not give me to forget about it.
But in general, I believe that a poor athlete who lives old victories, scrolls through its successful races over and over again.
a couple of days ponaslazhdatsya victory - and we must move on.
Preparation for this wonderful season was very different from the usual?
I can not say that it was something special.
To prepare, we started back in December, but the winter competitive season I missed.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the training camp, then back home.
Everything is as usual.
But the coach set the task: to try to reach a new level, which I was not.
Almost all the winter time spent on it, to lay the foundation.
Oncoming bunch of crosses, done exercises for physical training, which included and cravings, and squat, and we pumped back.
Then he set about preparing a barrier, a lot of technique involved.
Beyond that, how are the opponents, followed?
I always try to do, the benefit of the Internet age this is no problem.
I looked at the winter championship of Europe, and there is a barrier in a sprint the whole pedestal occupied the French!
I think again: it is necessary to do something, to dilute the company.
With every start of the season you added and added in the results.
This gave confidence?
I have all the latest season is on about the same scheme.
There is no, I'm running 13.20 first, and then - 13.50.
Always I untwist its shape gradually.
The main thing that I wanted to do - run out of the 13 seconds.
All the work has been focused primarily on the result.
But the paradox is that the kind of feeling that he is ready to feats, and the competition to show their willingness does not always work.
As it was, for example, at the Olympics in London?
I, frankly, the semi-final race (Shubenkov unable to qualify for the final -. "NO") tried to forget immediately.
Ready something was very good, really could run out of the 13 seconds.
Yes, even if repeated his best result at the time, I would have won the bronze medal of the Games.
But no luck.
His first World Cup, remember?
And how?
It was in Daegu.
Then I really wanted to get into the finals, there was a maximum program.
And I fell off right with utretsa in the preliminary heats.
Then I realized that the tear and rush headlong - then all will not come running.
Two years later at the World Championships in Moscow is already out in the final with the best time.
I remember my feelings before deciding the race: really wanted already to win "gold"!
How do you manage, developing a decent speed and still not lose your head, do not turn off?
But this is the most difficult.
You have to be very careful, focused on technology, so as not to bring down barriers.
I noticed that when setting is not the result, but on the process so much easier.
And the buzz when you get the feeling that you run, and if all is comes naturally!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the provinces after the first major successes tend to move closer to the capital.
I never had such thoughts?
House is still better.
Yes and no idea where I am without their coach, whom I need?
Maybe it would be nice to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
C Klevtsov you've been together?
With the 12 years since then, as in athletics came.
More specifically, I first trained with his wife, who worked with the children, and then she gave me.
I started with a sprint, then jump, triple in length.
Baby-around was - when hurl the ball, in the long jump with space ...
In 14 I tried to run with barriers, and I liked it.
From the first race it turned out to fulfill the norm of the second adult category.
And so it has remained.
Fear has never been before the barriers?
Somehow just happened to agree with them.
However, the above technique has always had to work a lot.
Won over a crackdown suffered much!
But can not escape from this routine.
The technique is necessary to perfect all the time - that night I could wake up, I immediately stood up and would run through the barriers.
All who saw your race in Beijing, claiming that it was a very nice race.
Thank you.
I myself liked.
Usually I do not revise their races, and then could not resist.
But the efficiency you need to continue to work - there is no limit to perfection.
Are not you afraid now that the victory of the year before the Olympic Games will be borne a heavy load?
As they say in such cases, I try to live up to expectations.
Once selected this way, then I have to go through.
My coach likes to say: if you do not wimp, no additional load should not feel.
And I was with him in this totally agree.
Otar Kushanashvilli
Well, I'm not so naive as to lead me to the astonishment of the reaction to the interview, which took place in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, they do not feed bread - give, podbros enemy.
And although I did not flag wrapped, the same, exactly the same, I say a million times here, and no one is directly called bastard - another hurt me.
All my psevdodruzya suddenly, in a moment somewhere evaporated.
Pressing, which I am subjected, so strong, that even I, battered boy, I think that people henbane overeat.
As if walking myself went and attacked the crowd and well mutuzit bars on you.
But you have to know me, I'm not an eagle room, my fist, I'm from howitzers vdarit, I'm old guys fear.
Another thing - no support.
I and-so had no illusions, but now ...
The best in me has always been self-sufficient, so take a bite.
And to give the passport such freaks as Fred Durst and Monson, Only fools.
It would be better to me, the best journalists working nestydno.
A week ago, in Kiev Otar Kushanashvili bluntly described the Crimean events:
What made the Crimean peninsula - a crime.
It is this and called annexation.
I believe that the reference to how drunk Khrushchev that was trying to sign, in any time does not fit into the overall picture of human society.
It is to come to his neighbor and take his living space ...
The war of the Kremlin's gone, and it will end just there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, as in the summer of 2008, she began to call some bastard from the Kremlin dungeon.
I have idea who it could be ...
Kobzon is not so much left to live.
I do not understand, he is the greatest artist, why would he have to lick the hands of Putin.
Did he lose the apartment?
Well, demolished a monument to him.
Of course, because people remember him as insulting his small home.
A reconciliation now only by Vladimir depends.

So the issue of security of places in kindergartens today one of the most pressing.
On September 1, was closed for major repairs of the kindergarten number 10, designed for 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repairs - 86 million rubles.
Such funds the city still had not received.
Last year, after the repair has opened a kindergarten number 23, which is now visited by 200 children.
Repairs were made to the co-financing from the regional and local budgets, the cost was more than 67 million rubles.
Through the efforts of the administration and support of the regional government was to raise funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and has helped the program "People's Initiative".
There are plans to start in 2016 the construction of a new kindergarten.

If we can handle a given volume, it will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At the time, the territory was built Sayan pig, which in 2004 was sold for a pittance.
We are working with prosecutors to overturn the deal.
All the more that the land under the object - in the federal property.
Work is underway with Moscow, the question of the transfer of 88 hectares of the regional property, with the subsequent transfer of land in the municipality.
There is a potential investor, ready to invest in the reconstruction and the launch of the project of 1.5 billion rubles.
With the launch of the pig farm we will have 900 jobs that will be for the city of great help.
Sayansk Institute developed social partnership?
We have signed about 140 contracts of socio-economic partnership.
Many projects failed to carry out due to the active social position of business representatives.
Tangible support provided by such enterprises as JSC "East-Center," New CHP Zima, Ltd. "Sayan Broiler", "PK MDF", the management of these enterprises respond to all requests.

How are Sayansk personnel problems in the social sphere?
The city does not have enough doctors and teachers of subject.
To address the staffing issue is of great importance to ensure housing for specialists.
Over the past year, we have identified five apartments for doctors, service housing received four teachers.

Diabetics with low obesity surgery can help obese
The beneficial effect after bariatric surgery in people with low obesity, type 2 diabetes, can last for at least five years, according to new research.
But now it is too early to say that diabetics with a slight overweight live longer after bariatric surgery than those who received nonsurgical treatment.
"Mortality statistics appears not once," - said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in bariatric surgery, has written a new study in JAMA Surgery Editor column.
Surgery for obesity, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit organizes the ability to absorb food.
For several years, bariatric surgery has proven effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the basic research conducted among people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, it is normal at a value of between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI of 25 or higher indicates that the overweight person, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese people.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, with medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with low obesity.
Mean BMI in those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
Meanwhile BMI those receiving non-surgical treatment of diabetes remains at about 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, completely cured of diabetes 36%, and some - 28%.
In the group receiving medication, for comparison, a complete cure of diabetes was observed in only 1%, and partial - only about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure readings, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," - the authors claim.
Researchers also controlled hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7% - the researchers write.
After surgery, hemoglobin A1c levels decreased an average of about 9% to about 6%.
In the treatment group, however, it remained stable, at around 8%.
But the best indicators of glycemic control, reflected good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to the head of research of Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery.
For the fifth year, in comparison with the group, Fábregas tubular gastrectomy, bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg) achieved a greater reduction in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3, 1% vs. 2.1%), and was closer to the complete remission of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical technique in life after five years, there is evidence for the study of people with overweight in Sweden, that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obese people, bariatric intervention chosen, the probability of dying within 15 years was approximately 29% lower compared with the group that uses more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that a new study showed no increase in life expectancy, Blackstone stated that it encourages people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in such a procedure.
"Here, the report is very important because it states that such surgery is safe in the group with low BMI, with no increased risk of mortality or renal disease," - she said.
Blackstone added that the people and their doctors need to start seriously the weight as soon as the patient's BMI falls between 27 to 30.
"I believe we wait too long to get people to take it seriously," - she said.
It seems to me that as soon as they have accumulated genetic changes that trigger their bodies in obesity and diabetes, reverse this very difficult.
In Mytishchi robbers carried out of the house coats and 9 million rubles.
In Mytishchi robbers attacked the residents of the Moscow Region home and stole from them 9 million rubles and three women's coats.
On it informs "Interfax" referring to the press service of the Interior Ministry.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown through the open door into the house, located on Gorky Street, tied 20-year-old son and the mistress of the house, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9,265,000 rubles, a criminal case under article "Robbery."
Fans from Europe at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotel has the right to place at tourists, who in 2018 will come to see the World Cup.
The rest of the hotel is not in a hurry to obtain a permit.
According to experts, this is a very worrying sign.
On the eve of the championship government urgently need to figure out how to settle all guests.
The two sides "Rosbalt" believe that due to the tournament cost rented apartments for rent will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship for rental housing will have to overpay.
The FIFA World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the championship, each hotel of St. Petersburg has to pass the classification procedure and to prove that the statement number of the stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that this can be done is not all: the hoteliers so afraid of inspections that are often not even are sent documents to the requests of the Federal Antimonopoly Service in St. Petersburg.
As the head of the FAS Vadim Vladimirov, the agency examined 138 hotels and is now planning to start a case against 34 hotels, many of which simply have not responded antimonopolschikov.
There are signs that the leadership of the three dozen companies deceived the citizens, placing a certain amount of stars in the advertisement, said Vladimir.
The problem is that now counts virtually every room, no one can not be lost before 2018 year.
Officials suspect that the fans will take all hotels in St. Petersburg during the football championship.
Now the city, tourists can look forward to 30.5 ths. Numbers.
According to the Smolny Institute in St. Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star, 100 - two- and three-star, 550 - one-star.
According to First Deputy Tourism Development Committee on Nana Gvichii, at the moment only 23 passed the classification of the hotel - so many audits conducted accredited in St. Petersburg company.
But if ordered any hotel similar procedure in regional enterprises, Smolny by a remarkable coincidence is not known.
That is the last classification may be more, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months hotels are not very eager to pass the classification", - admitted the director of the Northwestern branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry Ekaterina Shadsky.
This is due to the high season, during which the hoteliers make the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason - the budgets, which were not included in the audit cost, while treatment may cost the hotel depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more..
Yet in recent years intensified and hotel managers began to apply for the classification, assured Shadsky.
For hotels it is necessary to have time until July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but still did not get the right to work at the world championships.
It is already known that, depending on the star will develop a fixed fee for the hotel room for the duration of the tournament.
The formulas by which the value will be calculated, will manifest in the next year.
This is done in order to prevent price rise 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to have a conscience, and elevated two or three times, but hotels need to give money.
"I think growth will be up to 50%", - said the President of the Russian Hotel Association Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimirov not sure, in turn, that the fixing of prices consistent with the understanding of the market economy.
I do not know how it fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better unrestrained rise in price", - he said.
It is unclear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
State Duma introduced a bill according to which the hostels should be banned in homes.
We hope that this law will not be accepted or will not deal with St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that the hostels have to be saved," - says Nana Gvachiya.
However, she said, the owners of small hotels in any case have to be ready to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma will still approve a bill, then in St. Petersburg it will close about 80% of hostels, and at the moment in which there are 1.5 thousand. Rooms.
According to the president of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers of the North-West Leonid Garbar in St. Petersburg is not enough two-and three-star hotels, which just demand by football fans, but there is a bias in favor of hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is similar to a situation where "on the 80000th stadium seated 75,000 VIPs".
This can be corrected just by mini-hotels.
Their possible ban expert believes "idiocy": "I find it strange that some people can live in apartments, but the visitors somehow can not."
If the hostel is used as a dormitory, then I agree that it is wrong.
But if you like a hotel in which guests come for a short time, then why not?
Mini-hotels at risk to miss the World Cup and because of its sluggishness.
Entire hundreds of small hotels just do not have time to be classified, and a pit dug themselves.
By the summer of 2016 ordered all work will be the city hotels.
"The companies that can carry out this procedure is not so much, so they will give up the lower-paid orders of mini-hotels, and will choose those more expensive", - said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in some cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, figures passed checks at the moment is much higher in St. Petersburg.
The reason for the delay is linked to the St. Petersburg including the constant reshuffling in the government's tourism unit, which is not conducive to harmonious work.
According to experts, if all hotels in St. Petersburg is not enough, that most likely will have to pay attention to the regional hotels and holiday homes.
Following the example of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg in the city can mobilize river fleet, ie, guests of the tournament will be able to stay in the cabins.
In addition, many fans will come to the Prepared vans, in which it will be possible to spend the night.
"The main thing is not to set up as many hotels that then they empty", - said Gennady Lamshin.
It is also very popular during the football championship will use the rented housing.
Most likely the city will create a pool of rented apartments.
Rental rates will rise by 10-30%.
"- Leaves a house near the stadium of the first of the obvious", - said the lease of the Agency's specialist and research in Larissa Bragin Real Estate.
And the rental price can not go back to the previous level after the championship, especially in residential areas.
This will also contribute to the construction of new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she said.
Do not forget about the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city where people do not just suggest the road, but can also hold a mini-tour.
There are also complications.
My dad was in 1970 in the courtyard met a family from Murmansk - father, mother and two children.
They turned out to have no place to spend the night: with hotels was then difficult for the station to sleep heavily.
"And the pope gave them in our communal apartment to sleep" - recalled the source.
However, he added that such traits in the inhabitants of the city left - call to his home is fraught with consequences, and terrible.
But it may, in 2018 after the failure of the State Duma of the decisions hoteliers errors and governments will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "leaked" the Amur Region.
With admiration today looked at clowning Zhirinovsky State Duma.
He did such a thing, when our generation has yet learned to sell newspapers, and is still in great shape.
His topic, like, - "LDPR protest against the election results in the Amur region."
Protocols are not shaking - for nothing; other protocols in addition to the signed election commissions, the Liberal Democratic Party, apparently not.
Here he raises the runner-up Ivan Abramov and shouted something like: "Here - the winner of the election!"
And then neither of which ties into Rodnina, and then, after a skirmish since the chairman, takes a fraction of a conference room, literally screaming, "You all fronts with your crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, gives emphasis not on Abramov, and the scandal and move fraction as a result of this scandal and insults.
Wolfowitz really beautiful and elegantly merged the Amur Region, together with Abramov.
For all countries it is - another trick Zhirinovsky in the style of "Scum!", And not the political party protest against the results of a particular election.
And faction formally quarreling, and elections, according to the party's website and facebook Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the theme is obvious leader peels.
Provides dead-on-Amur by burying their dead, and he preaches against the "United Russia" in general, and in no way guilty Rodnina.
An elegant solution to avoid losing face, and now, rather than flashy scandal will not go.
Another thing is that now is in a strange position himself Abramov.
Also screams from his superiors he did not wait, alternative protocols on the hands there.
He - not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for a narrow circle he became the formal reason for insulting a respected champion, and that even steeper, boorish attacks against the EP and the ONF.
And then of course he should be very seriously think about what to do.
Because the main beneficiary of the election, the policy number 2 in the region and the candidate number 1 is the only regional single-member districts it can turn into a pariah who successfully popolzovatsja own party leadership and the super-stimulus for the very ONF and the party leadership of others.
That's for sure - it would not be Zhirinovsky, it ought to come up and watch him respectfully.
Trump has yet to grow and grow.
There was news that the Liberal Democratic Party will return to the room during the next plenary sitting.
That is, the bath dropped even with nothing.
The only topic under Abramov is buried.
Beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible to have all come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe can not accept all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama has addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Center for Compassion Dalai Lama at Oxford, dedicated to research ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be above the interests of individual countries, or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this is admirable, the reaction of Western countries on the refugee crisis is not adequate to the situation.
"It neozmozhno that all came to Europe", - he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the undertaken actions of Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of thousands of refugees - is fine, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education in the Muslim countries", - he stressed.
In the end, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We need to ease the use of force.
The use of force will never solve these problems ", - he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George W. Bush after the attacks of 9/11, stating that tough US response launched a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed his condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is possible through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and this has caused unintended consequences, "- said the Dalai Lama.

"This is a high concentration of alcohol", - he told Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician poison control center at the hospital of the University of Kansas.
You would not have left just a glass of whiskey, but people keep on referring to these hand sanitizers, and if the kids to get them, it's a quick way to consume large amounts of alcohol.
Naidzha Russell, a six year old girl who swallowed a recent school of hand sanitizer with strawberry aroma in the amount of about four sprays, was sent for treatment in the emergency department.
The level of alcohol in the blood of it was 179, two times more than that of an adult who by law is considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie - emergency doctor who treated her at the medical center Gwinnett near Atlanta .
Naidzha confused words and could not walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors watched her the whole night in a separate children's clinic, so as not to miss any signs of brain injury, as due to alcohol girl fell and hit his head, said Ritchie.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoriya Scott, mother Naidzhi.
It could well be fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use a non-alcoholic substance or disinfectant wipes, besides chtby remove liquid disinfectant for the hands of children's reach zone.
Apart from alcohol poisoning, some disinfecting fluid is associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contains methanol - a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which has been listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three student-fourth-graders in the north of New York conspired to poison them "nasty" by the teacher "spread of antimicrobial agents in the class," according to a police report.
At the teacher's severe allergy to disinfectants for hands, and she forbade keep them in class.
Police believe that the failed plan was "empty talk", and addresses the issues of discipline to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the Regional Children's Library. NK Krupskaya sad cast iron owl.
The kids, who come for the books, trying to feed her sweets.
For several generations, she goes to the library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twenties of the last century, staged here loud readings, staged plays on verses of Mayakovsky, conducted literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as he wrote in 1939, the newspaper "Young Stalinist" every day "friendship between Nadezhda Krupskaya and friends of Barnaul Children's Library" was becoming stronger.
Nadezhda even sent once distant Barnaul friends his childhood photo.
And when barnaultsy asked no objection if Krupskaya to the library was given her name, I wrote that there was no objection.
Letters long been gathering dust in the museum, and grandchildren of the first to explain to readers whose stern is decorated with bas-relief profile of the library building.
In the years of perestroika, often called different people, outraged: Why Children's Library is not renamed?
Let it be a library name of a good children's writer, with no political overtones!
Library staff sat down and thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" - this is probably the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul like "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - path of yellow brick.
"The Wizard of Oz" - a favorite theme of the artist Oli Moskovka.
Previously, Olga was a manager at a law firm, came to work at eight, went to five, and from all the other managers differed only love to draw.
And then I found on the Internet announcement: "Illustrator is required to book."
I write a book a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mother has cancer."
Olya did illustrations, and thought life could end at any time, and no miracles would not it, if you can not create their own.
Now she works in a library, illustrates children's books writers all over the world and she writes stories.
Traditionally, children lose interest in the book, they increasingly live in some virtual space ...
But to us, then go read the children and their parents understand the value of reading - says the "Russian world" director Tatyana Kushvid library.
In recent years we have even emerged a moment of confidence, that the children's library is needed, and it will live - the kids something going here!
I think the interest in reading returns.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained with updated photo exposition.
Once a quarter, posted new photos of readers who go to the library with your family: mother, father and children.
In the library I am happy that children are increasingly began to arrive Pope.
If in two years to read all the baby Chukovsky, the older age of the book he needed a little more complicated.
But now the law on which the eight-year child prodigy is forbidden to give out books from the category 12+.
To get a book, the child must bring a parent - they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" has become for them a kind of a family club.
The library has a treasure - a collection of pre-revolutionary epics with yatyami and erami, stories Korolenko in the annex to the magazine "Niva" filing "Murzilki" for 1936.
After all, we are now not only the conceptual space "book temple", we are now open to traffic, we try to be a special place: not home, not work, not school - says Tatiana Kushvid.
To us, you can come to collectively read, play, draw.
We did a play area for kids - baby arrives just play, and the hand is still reaching for the book!
Some parents carry our readers, and they abut legs do not want to leave.
Often come mothers with prams - and we are pleased that the library they are tied for first place among all the other places where it is necessary to come with the kids.
Tatiana Kushvid says today's children just as we do when something like the classic children's literature:
"Publishing is developing, and much attention is paid to the authors, who are the link between the generations."
And if we talk about small children, then it is important that there was some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to part with their heroes.
The library is constantly releasing booklets for parents, which explains what is happening in contemporary children's literature, which books should pay attention to and why.
Booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are interested, but the library is still not for them.
Enduring books beyond reading room for adults is prohibited.
This magical privilege is only for children.
... In the farthest room of the library is the square hatch with ancient wooden staircase to the basement, in the stacks.
The steps will creak under your steps - this is a very old time machine.
With a book of his childhood meet as an old friend: hello, good thing we're not changing.
Ellie still fun walking along the road paved with yellow brick, lazy Toll Ryzhikov steals magical match and Malchish-Kibalchish did not say damn burzhuinam military secrets - is too strong a word from him.
Such books - as passwords on them anywhere you can find their own.
There is a real book store, and a rarity - such as pre-revolutionary collection of epics with yatyami and erami.
Or in the famous story Korolenko annex to the magazine "Niva".
Or filing "Murzilki" for 1936.
Time to grow old pages, paint them the color of tea.
These publications readers are no longer issued.
It fragments of our future collections, I dream - and retire'll rare children's books.
But the children on it already, so to speak, lead: and paint in old books is not very bright, and the subject ... you open the first page, and then - Lenin, the Party, the Young Communist League.
Now I think: why we all subscribed to the "Pioneer truth?"
Still, it was interesting, - says the "Russian world" Galina Ilyasova, head of the book depository.
Pages "Murzilki" dark times.
Galina book depository in charge of his whole life.
She knows what color hat Pinocchio, in any school year, Harry Potter became captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team to the championship on the situations in which Carlson uses a silencer for motor, and he works the father of Alice Selezneva.
For the librarian job paid little, and those who can live without these book series very quickly find yourself another profession.
There remain only the most convinced: educators, teachers, ministers of the cult book.
They can learn more and smile - it is believed that this feature of the professional children's librarian.
When he smiled at you in the first minute of conversation - it's a professional.
I do love children's books: As a librarian I like them to be, to smoothly and beautifully stood on the shelves, and I also love to read, - says Galina.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.
I read contemporary Russian authors, translations of fresh ...
Of course, it seems to me, in my childhood, everything was different.
Books were the most interesting and exciting of all, then what happened to me.
And since I'm really fond of them, it seemed to me that the library - it's a magical place.
And I wanted to work where all sit and read.
I hope that the book will always, in spite of the readers.
And I am glad, when our former readers bring their children and even grandchildren ...

Why do I - the witness executions in Oklahoma
Today, evading legal intervention at a later stage, I'll look like a person execute.
If that happens, and I hope that all is not well, I'll sit on the viewing gallery death row in Oklahoma prison, when Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time the request was made in January, after his close friend, and although I was plunged into shock, I agreed.
With the approach of that day, I began to be afraid.
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to be present at executions in the United States, and, as often wanting more than the seats of the grim lottery to decide who will be selected.
In Oklahoma, the number of seats for the press cut from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotion.
I can not do it.
I'll sit down with my closest friends Richard Glossipa, and we with him any personal relations after months of phone calls and one visit, which lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk with them.
The prison administration states that I can not be both a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and pen to write down what I see.
I'll try to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter that I'm doing my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of a prisoner as he likes to access.
I complained to her.
She acknowledged that she "could be better and to formulate", but still believes that I am wrong in what I do.
Richard Glossip disagreed with something from what I said and wrote.
He did not tell me what to write, and I would not do it, even if he was talking about.
I told him that he could erase me from your list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants the international edition of the journalist was there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that the publicity will help the movement for the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from the "Huffington Post" to be together with me.
If you want to know about this fact more, listen to podcasts, which I recorded.
I will not go into detail here again.
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treeze make him guilty of aiding and abetting the crime.
But I believe that there is a high probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death penalty was not enough.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And I will watch him die from this angle.
I can not say that I would be completely objective.
There will be other reporters, to which it is possible for it to apply.
From me you will learn what it is - to look like a man that I like, without having to die.

Peter Moody accuses stewards in an attempt to spy and threatened to leave the equestrian sport
Peter Moody Racing Victoria stewards accused of trying to implement a spy in his stable last year and threatened to leave immediately equestrian sport.
His target was the stewards and the employees of the department of ethics Racing Victoria, whom he accused of having organized a campaign against him personally, and removal from the start Lady Tatai due to violation of rules of use of drugs in the starting day, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media, he always makes every effort by participating in the race, and he found himself in a difficult situation, when it came to a positive result, LIDAR samples for cobalt, which he can not explain.
He adhered to a language on the suspicion of spying for a year and a half and did not want to make it "look like sour grapes."
"I'm not going to say anything about it, and suffered for a long time, but sometimes you it is so unsettling that no longer constrains", - said Moody.
They know that this is going on.
Sometimes you react, then you must experience the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
Today I'll go home and sleep soundly.
I want to walk with your head held high and I want to make my owners know - I'm doing everything possible for them.
When they start to think that this is not the case, then I will have to stop being a coach.
Then I have to think what to do with your license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally said during an interview on racing.com, that the Ethics Office was trying to spy on him in the stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I'll call if asked, and offered him a job in my stables to transmit information about what I do in my stable," - Moody's said on Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a crook.
If so, all of them, of course, should apply, since my attempt to catch it failed.
Robert Ralston, former chairman of RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondrio, any present executive director of RVL, knew about it all the time and know today.
Should not this make me think that the case becomes personal?
Should not in RVL courage to call to account for what happens in this business, people other than coaches?
I bad for the profession?
So I bad for the profession?
Maybe people there think that this is the case.
Maybe they need to pick up my license and pushed me away, and I have no doubt - what I am saying, can make them think about it.
But right now I got to the point where I do not care, and it saddens me.
I on this really sad.
I'm going to put pressure on them and hold them responsible for the decision.
I have the support of the family, and I can leave.
Annoyance coach only grow in the course of a long investigation into the case of cobalt and LIDAR, and the last removal of horses from the start forced him to declare that he can "throw his license on the table."
Moody, best known for the fact that prepared the invincible champion Black Caviar, described the requirements for the use of medicines in the day of the competition "ridiculous" after the horse legs was applied a poultice of clay, which is a violation of the rules.
It is a violation of the rules at the races.
"I have to take full responsibility for it, - he said.
One of my employees mistakenly gave her wrap on the leg.
She could get a compress last night.
She could get it yesterday, as it were.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody may be disqualified for three months according to the rules on the use of medicines in day of competition for the use of a compress, about what the stewards have opened an investigation.
This anecdote.
People who create these rules, do not know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far", - said Moody.

Coach "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellamy is parried accusations opponents in the use of hard power devices
Coach "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellamy named intercept the ball criticism of his team as "the imposition of the agenda" by the two favorites NRL championship.
Coach "Sydney Roosters" Trent Robinson said that the judge allowed the "Storm" to "fight" with his team during a sudden victory "Storm" in the final qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Coach "Brisbane Broncos' Wayne Bennett made a clear allusion to the" Storm "after his team won the final of the qualifying tournament for" Northern Queensland Cowboys "on Saturday night, when he called the game a" typical "for rugby league and said that two Queensland team were "very successful" in the melee.
Bellamy defended intercept the ball and his team said that they were just focused on the "contact", intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he inspired confidence criticism of his team from the top two coaches, because it means that they are concerned about the possible defeat of the "Storm".
"It continues to emerge - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about the hard receptions, when they beat us with a score of 24: 2" - Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed a whole year in their systems or techniques of protection, just in the last six weeks, we have paid special attention to contacts with the interception of the ball, and it was a turning point for us.
Trent there for three years now and he obviously coached by a great team, so he probably was not used to losing, and it was a shock for some of it.
Funny how it always appears at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with the idea of Bennett about "spectacular football," recalled his teacher that "St George-Illawarra Dragons" Bennett won the championship in 2010, showing the "boring" football.
Wayne says of exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our Friday night, and see just how impressive was their game, "- said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010. "St. George's" a lot of criticism, calling the boring team, and Wayne said that it is not at all concerned.
But now he has a team that can show that he believes the football spectacular, especially their young midfield with their speed.
This is football, in which you would want to play when you have such players.
He made this observation in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two such halfback Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play.
It gives me more confidence, because they say these things, because they are more concerned about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably were not thinking about us when got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game "Storm" and "Roosters" was a match with more points than a game "Broncos" and "Cowboys".
The game "Broncos" was probably good, I have not seen her, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18, there were two attempts - and that this is an impressive football?
Or consider impressive breaks and failed attempts?
For me it's routine.
If they mention us, this means that at some point we can meet them there.
In "Storm" at the end of this week off, as they have won the right to host a "North Queensland Cowboys" or "Kronalla Sharks' next Saturday evening at the preliminary final at AAMI Park stadium, tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning .

I talked with coach Dimitris Itoudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, - quotes "R-Sport" Freeland. - In fact, to me, would be entrusted with Sasha Kaun, who left the team in defensive constructions, as well as in the attack of a three-second zone, and I think I can handle it.
Yes, I need some time to rebuild to the centering position, still in the NBA, I played more forward.
Now it will have to resist more than a large pivot opponent, but I'm already used to doing this, so I think, and now can handle.
CSKA won the Euroleague last time in 2008.
Since then they have traveled six times to the "Final Four", but each time there could not show his best basketball.
It argued that the team someone jinxed.
That's the game you can not win forever.
Of course, it is difficult, I understand the frustration of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best of what they are capable, then we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
Ever wanted to win this title, Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this will be a year of CSKA.
As for the evil eye, I am not a superstitious person and I do not believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then everything is possible.
I and before the games do not have any specific rituals, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.

The captain of "Arsenal" Mikel Arteta says his team-mates must support the injured Jack Wilshere ahead of the game with "Dinamo Zagreb"
In a conversation with Wilshere Wenger also said that even only in September, and that provided the Wilshire recovery goes according to plan, then it is nothing to prevent return to the game for Christmas.
At the Wilshire favorable development of events exactly miss at least the next four games in England and, given what had happened, his participation in the European Championships next summer remains in question.
Most offensive of all in the recent issue of the fact that Wilshere confidently finished the previous season with an ankle injury and only going back to the usual aggressive style during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury does not threaten his career."
It's just not fully healed bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
This is not due to the ankle or with injuries that had occurred before.
This may be related things from a medical point of view, but is also made Wenger, there are associated risks further injury to any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, at the Wilshire recorded 23 various injuries that occurred to him in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he played in only 65 of the 157 "Arsenal" games in the league over the past five seasons.
If you look at the balance of the "Arsenal" is wider, you can see that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, "Arsenal" was one of two clubs in the Premier League, which account for most missed due to injury days.
Wenger admits the likelihood of getting stuck in a vicious circle, but in the "Arsenal" believe that the improvement of statistics on injuries in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, returning from injury, you are in for some time, see yourself vulnerable - during this time you need to recover and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough and cope.
I hope that he will recover physically, I'm sure of it, as well as the fact that his career would be such that it deserves.
Arsenal is launching a campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday with the match "Dinamo Zagreb" and it will continue on Saturday with the games, "Chelsea" and the following Wednesday - with "Tottenham Hotspur", and Wenger intends to rotate the composition.
Hector bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, therefore, likely to be in the starting lineup to play Arteta and Mathieu Debuchy.
Maybe Wenger will also introduce a part of Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead Nacho Moreale and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep a balance and give some respite to those players who need it," said Wenger.
Although the "Arsenal" an absolute favorite in Group F, the stadium "Maksimir" in Zagreb is one of the most disappointing in Europe.
"Dynamo" have not lost any of the 41 matches since they got to spend last season as the "Invincibles".
On Tuesday evening, the stadium has been exposed to an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have learned the lesson from last season, when the team was defeated in the Champions League game against Monaco, and remains with the faint hope lead the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
"This is an incredible drive", - said Wenger.
"Arsenal" has never done.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have the ambition, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy show that teaches us great lessons of male friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially when you consider just how desperate was the need of men of candor, now more than ever, despite the fact that the suicide rate among young men is at a maximum of 15 years.
In 2013, it became the single biggest cause of death in men aged between 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom, and the men happen three times more often than women.
In an attempt to understand the problem of "Campaign against the miserable life," he declared 2015 the Year of men to challenge the culture that does not allow men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle, to take up this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 university students exhibiting symptoms of depression, found that if a patient has a sufficiently large number of friends "in a normal frame of mind," the chances of a cure are doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of friends of the mentally healthy halves the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, the friendship worked, first of all necessary to make it.
In an age when communications are controlled by social networks, when the style preferred content, speed of response is often more valuable than a meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to appear strong, loving, fun, and successful, even if in reality reigns alone.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, is entirely due to internal values, our internal desire for personal growth and friendship that strongly affects our mental health.
And, as recently noted by one billionaire creator of video games, for money generally can not buy more happiness.
Dignity Friends that they draw attention to it.
Each of the characters are not defined by their work, but, rather, through the personality, which manifested itself in communicating with friends.
Humor Joey and Chandler's permanent embrace, moments of football viewing in a comfortable chair, sighs Rachel Ross on - all proceeds from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from a full investigation of his senses.
As I said the employee "Samaritens": "... my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal, highlights how even a small chat friends can benefit."
Often the men who come to us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old teaching "live with it" much the same as the feeling that a frank discussion of the problems can be perceived as a weakness. "
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer a continuously operating coping mechanisms.
It emphasized the subtle moments of male friendship.
As for my problem, the status of a stranger, talking on the phone, helps people in moments of despair, as long-term support comes from the inner circle of family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, where the holiday is fully restored scenery, why not take your friends to have a drink at Central Perk.
Or even better - if you see a lone man in Starbucks, smile and say "hello."
Obviously not guess what benefit can bring friendship.
The series Friends show on Comedy Central from beginning to end, all the 236 series by tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores by helping "PSG" to defeat the "Malmö"
Angel Di Maria on a par with Blaise Matyuydi and Edinson Cavani celebrates score balls into the goal, "Malmo".
Angel Di Maria, making his debut in the Champions League, scored than allowed, "PSG" easy to get around, "Malmo" on Tuesday.
Here are the match reports and reaction on the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have done their job, when the "Paris Saint-Germain" has begun the game in the Champions League with a very comfortable win 2: 0 against "Malmo" at the stadium Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored a goal in less than four minutes after he started his first game in the Champions League as a player, "PSG", to set the direction of champions France, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increased their advantage when Cavani scored a goal on 61 minutes.
Along with the "Real Madrid" and Donetsk "Shakhtar" in Group A, "Paris," it was necessary to take a good start in the game against the champions of Sweden, as they are not aimed at the qualification of the playoffs, and the continuation of a series of successful games the past three seasons, where they reached the quarter-finals.
They earned points, but at the same time, it was not the best solution on the part of Laurent Blanc count Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later to replace him on the field in a game against a team from his native city and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999 .
"It's not easy - to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win with a score 2: 0, deliver opponents problems and excellent play in defense - is a good start, even if there are things that we will need to modify for season ", - said Blanc.
This is promising.
We wanted to win and we did it, even though I regret that we did not score one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic back from injury in one of the substitutions as part of the Paris team that brought her a draw with a score of 2:2 in a match with "Bordeaux" in the First League at the weekend, but it upstaged Di Maria in the fourth minute.
Argentine striker celebrated as a player capable of leading the "PSG" to a new level in Europe, after it last month bought the "Manchester United", and he proved why when he ran onto a pass from Marco Verratti behind protection "Malmo" and beautifully finished off an attack, sending the ball past Johan Villanda into the far corner.
However, if someone expected then from the "PSG" light and a big win, they had to be disappointed.
"Malmo", which defeated Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, having composed of nine world-class players on the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two defensive midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, except for the impact of Nikola Dzhurdzhicha in which the ball flew past the far post gate Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
But "PSG" sometimes let himself transmissions ineffective and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who in the first half failed to realize at least five attempts, and then could not handle the ball, Cavani scored immediately after the restart of play.
However, he proved to be far more skillful in the exact pasach, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, who received Di Maria sent the ball swirling strike, which was held tightly to the rod by Wieland on 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after after Ibrahimovic corrected ball sent into the midfield from the left flank by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that were in the "Malmö" about returning to the game, only to intercept the ball and Wieland from close range did not allow David Luiz to increase the final score before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi goal will not count in the very end of the match.
Coach "Malmo" Aage Hareide later acknowledged that PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, but this is not the level.
Qualifying is not enough.
Glory "Paris"!
It was a wonderful match with them.

The forum also will bring together representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian businessmen.
Will work trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.

News Economics - Nobel laureate: globalization
Print processes of globalization were to contribute to the reduction of inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, the difference in incomes of the population in emerging economies, by contrast, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To fix this, you need to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, said chief researcher at the International Laboratory for the analysis and selection of HSE solutions, Nobel Prize in Economics in 2007 Eric Maskin.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Business borders between countries were becoming more open.
Proponents of globalization, predicted big gains for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," - emphasizes Maskin.
For example, China and India have gained significant growth in GDP per capita.
However, not all so rosy.
It was expected that globalization would reduce the gulf between the "haves" and "have nots" in poor countries, which manifests itself in a large income inequality - or rather, wage.
But in fact this inequality only increased, notes Eric Maskin, in his article "Why the global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, which translated and quoted NIE Economics.
Together with the economist and Harvard professor Michael Kremer Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory, which demonstrates why the increased difference in incomes in poor countries by increasing globalization, reminds NIE Economics.
The new specific processes are the global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin identifies four levels of professional development - A and B for the rich countries, the D and C - for the poor.
After globalization D professionals from poor countries do not have enough skill level to cooperate with the experts A and B of the rich countries.
And if workers P from poor countries the salary increases due to cooperation with the staff of the B-rich, the workers do not feel the growth of D or their wages did fall.
The final effect is that the internationalization of production will increase the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thus increase inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin offered surprisingly beautiful model, alternative Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It helps explain why globalization has led to inequality in income - says Fuad Alasgarov, ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory for the analysis and selection decisions, Head of the Department of Mathematics, Higher School of Economics.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge of empirical studies in this field.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the educational level of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist does not have this money and unprofitable companies to pay for their education.
In this situation, a significant role can governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations, Maskin said.
Scientists note that the developed theory in any case does not call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has brought and brings to fruition in the form of GDP growth.

The US Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The US Embassy in Russia has expressed regret in connection with the closure in force at the Library of Foreign Literature, American Center.
Center in Moscow worked more than 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Center of the US Embassy at the Russian State Library. Rudomino in Moscow.
"Unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent years, have questioned the commitment of the Russian government relations between the Russian and American people, who were not interrupted even during the Cold War and in other difficult moments of the long history of relations between our countries", - says the statement of US Ambassador John Tefft received by "Interfax".

It was a center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings, with numerous American prominent figures, among them the astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Last year alone, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational activities and adopted more than 50,000 Russian visitors," - said the diplomat.
Tefft said that about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program) program of educational exchanges.
Green Tribunal appeared imminent in the massacre.
A typical situation: the four officers standing in front of the judges table Svatantera Kumar, listening to his claim to the work done.
The Court did not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We are not to have provided you with 110-page order that you made fun of him, - says Kumar. -
If you would put at least one more brick, we will order to demolish all the buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NGT) - judicial authority, established in 2010 in order to stop the rapid environmental pollution that accompanies rapid economic growth in recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal had to consider more than 10 thousand claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and the construction of dams.
In two of the three cases the court takes a decision to halt construction, leading to contamination.
Bids are incredibly high: in less than 60 years have passed since the declaration of independence enhanced industrial development India has become the country from virgin jungle in one of the most congested and polluted countries in the world.
Particularly acute is the problem in large metropolitan areas, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: the city covered with dense smog, rivers filled with pesticides and waste management businesses and households, and the few remaining residential areas are being cut down for development of new residential areas.
Despite the formal support of the green movement on the part of the state, NRT is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as is often the main reason for the abolition of the largest investment projects.
So, in May of this year the Minister of Environment environment called the court decision "extreme" and "unfeasible."
Sometimes the court decision actually can not be executed in the period delivered by the court, the lawyer confirms in environmental cases Raj Panjwani.
However, unrealistic deadlines and have a positive side, at least they make the responsible persons to move.
"Its main goal - to shake up the system", - adds the lawyer.
Green Tribunal has repeatedly canceled large building: in his account termination airport construction, power plants and hundreds of smaller structures.
At the same time about people trying to also not forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnana polluting the local river fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are responsible for, and economic consequences.
"People lose their jobs," - commented on his decision to Kumar.
However, such explanations do not always find understanding from ordinary people whose lives may change due to one stroke of a judicial pen.
So, in April, the Tribunal has decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years to enter the capital, which led to nation-wide outrage.
Despite the sharply fallen in popularity and a barrage of criticism, Svatanter Kumar refused to reverse this decision.
Instead, he ordered the government statistics about Delhi travel in and out of vehicles, as well as the proposed purchase 10 thousand additional buses previously learned in factories, whether they perform a similar order in the state.
As soon as to the attention of the court began to fall into such pollution sources as landfills, fuel quality, and even traffic accidents, people's anger had begun to subside.
But the most painful topic of principle the judges was a program to clean up the Ganges River, announced with fanfare by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the past year.
When it comes to the Ganga - sacred to the Hindus River, the judge often ceases to restrain their emotions and moves to cry.
You know, what does the word "holy"?
Someone poured water from the Ganges to the statue of God, and there were feces - Hot judge. -
You continue to pollute the river, because you think: is the Ganges Ganges, he will take away all our sins.
This river, which we worship, and see what you are doing with it every day.
Clean Ganga is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project, announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in the river exceeds the norm in more than 120 times.
Every year, between 1.5 and 3 of the 700 million Hindus bathe in it to die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Fund for Saving the Ganges money raised from the sale of his suit, in which he met with Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: costume was bought for 700 thousand dollars, while it requires at least eight billion to clean up the river.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India is still a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but it does not believe that the price of progress is to be ecology.
"In a developing country for the environment calls are often perceived as a luxury - says the activist organization" Call of the Ganges "Malik Bhanot. -
And the court is trying to find the right balance between environment and development. "
