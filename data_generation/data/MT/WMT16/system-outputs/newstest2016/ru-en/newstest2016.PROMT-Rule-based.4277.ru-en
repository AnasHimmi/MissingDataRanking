The social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as the electronic payment instrument.
Changes provide preservation of a travel privilege in public passenger transport.
Since September 24 the order of the organization of travel privilege of citizens with use of the social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region changes.
As the press service reports the government of Russia across the Ivanovo region, changes provide preservation of a travel privilege in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual settlements under the social card into accord with requirements of the Federal law No. 161 Federal Law "About National Payment Service Provider".
At the same time the social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as the electronic payment instrument.
Respectively, conditions of its application change.
So, the limit of replenishment is set not on trips as earlier now, and in an amount of money, with preservation of the winter and summer periods - in the winter no more than 400 rubles, during the summer period - no more than 800 rubles the current month.
Now social card holders on the receipts issued in transport will need to keep track not of quantity of the remained trips, but the rest of money.
The cost of discounted travel for citizens will make 1/2 tariffs, acting at carrier.
The remained half of fare is compensated by the regional budget.
The schedule of replenishment of the social card in cash remains the same - during the period about 24 numbers of the last month on the 23rd day of the current month.
The new order of traveling with the social card will have a number of advantages.
So, there is an opportunity to keep the detailed account of an expenditure of money on the social card to within kopeks.
Besides, there is a possibility of return enlisted, but unspent money.
Let's add also that the scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent as now a half of fare is paid by the citizen, and just the same sum is compensated to carrier by the budget.
No fee at loading onto the card of money will be charged.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, the deputy chief of department of road economy and transport of the Ivanovo region, reported that in 2014 in the region more than 33 million trips with use of the social card, in the 2015th - nearly 25 million trips were made.
More than 470 million rubles are provided in the regional budget on providing travel privilege of citizens with use of the social card.
As of September 1 compensation sum on these purposes made more than 312 million rubles.
During a 911 call the teacher admits murder of the girlfriend
During a 911 call by voice almost without a shudder the teacher of higher education institution Shannon Lamb told polices that shot the girlfriend and that employees who would arrive to them home are necessary.
Lamb emphasized that in the house there is "doggie" who is alive, but is probably upset, and told that contacts of family members died can be found in its phone.
Indoors police officers found Amy Prentiss's body and the note which is carelessly handwritten on a white leaf of the ruled paper: "It is a pity to me, I would like to return back everything, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me", - it is said in a note, according to representatives of bodies, signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb who conducted two online courses at the University of the state of the Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi managed to go for 300 miles by then to a university campus, where as the police considers, he shot the highly respected teacher of history Ethan Shmidt on a threshold of its office.
The police chief of the University of the state of the Delta Leann Baford reported that the staff of the university learned about firing at 10:18 in the morning.
He reported that Lamb made that truthful 911 call soon after that.
By the end of day of the victims will be one more: Lamb committed suicide as soon as the police surrounded him.
Next day after firing in educational institution forced students and teachers to hide behind the locked doors, the staff of bodies still tried to put the motives which induced Lamba in one picture.
Information which investigators at both ends of the state shared and also students and employees who knew it helped to make a portrait talented, but, perhaps, the concerned teacher.
Students told that they looked forward to it occupations.
The police in Gautier where Prentiss died, reported that charges of violence or criminal cases are not registered for it.
Shmidt included Lamba in the book written to them in which he expressed gratitude to "beautiful people" with whom it was crossed in the teaching life.
Both of them taught at faculty of social sciences and history which totals 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures of that and another.
At the same time there were some prerequisites of emergence of problems.
One student who praised Lambe Brandon Bivers, reported that he besides seemed alarmed and nervous, "as though with him something was not as it should be".
Other student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb at the end of the academic year 2014-15 told him about how he struggled with a stress.
Earlier Lamb asked the University of the state of the Delta to grant it a sick leave, having told that it has some problems with health.
This year he taught only on two online courses.
Recent changes in university hiring policies meant that degree of the doctor on which receiving Lamb so persistently worked, would not guarantee it automatic receiving a position of the teacher.
The president of the university William LaForge reported that he does not know of the conflict between Lamb and Shmidt, but "obviously, Mr. Lamba had something on mind".
These are questions which Lamb will not be able to answer any more.
The police found Lamba's trace after his escape from a campus when it went back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself from the otdnozaryadny gun of the 38th caliber on the backyard of the house, in one mile to the South from the house of the parents Greenville, Mississippi in the suburbs, reported the coroner of the district Washington Methel Johnson.
Its car with the running engine still stood on the access road.
Not at once it was unclear why Lamb arrived to this house though, according to Johnson, she believes that he knew the people living in it.
Lamb grew up in those regions.
Lamb began to work at the university at which 3500 students in the city with the population about 12000 are registered, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogics.
He received a doctorate in education in the spring of the same year.
One of longtime friends of Lamba described it as clever, charismatic and cheerful person.
Carla Hairston told what to her was 15, and Lambu is 20 years old when they got acquainted through mutual friends.
It and her friends went to high school, and it the cool guy was more senior which within several years tried to teach her to play the guitar.
Those years it had success with women.
All girls melted when it was near", - Hairston whom now 40 and who lives in Jackson, Brandon's suburb says.
Lamb and Prentiss by the time of the events, probably, met already some time.
During a 911 call of Lamb told: "I killed the wife", but record about registration of their marriage is absent.
Couple had a dog by the name of the Lightning which lived with them in Gautier in the brick house which reverse side comes to the canal.
According to police, with a dog everything is all right.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends and that they have a daughter, which 19 years now.
"It is absolutely suppressed", O'Steen told about the daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen told that he did not meet Lamb, but heard from the daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb got acquainted with Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they together played at concerts from time to time.
O'Steen told that his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for the different companies.
Mike Shaffer, the bartender and in combination the coordinator of entertainment programs in dimly lit bar The Julep Room in the suburb of Gautier, told that the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss in the evening on September 5 when Lamb stopped playing the guitar and a harmonica for few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
"Just happy couple", - he told.
We had fun and made fun of each other.
In sense that both of them were very witty.
Shmidt, the died teacher, conducted seminars for first-year students and specialized in history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, - Don Allan Mitchell, the teacher of English in the same educational institution told.
He was married and at him was three small children.
He studied at the University of the State of Kansas in Emporia and was the president of fraternity and student government.
In a campus of the University of the state of the Delta in Cleveland in the evening on Tuesday about 900 people, including teachers of the university, personnel, students and associates, participated in a candlelight memorial.
Shmidt's wife of Lise and the brother Jeff Shmidt were also present at a ceremony during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Lessons will be recommenced on Wednesday.
"We try to return our students", - LaForge told.
Crisis is undergone.
Today day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Authors of Associated Press of Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans helped to prepare the reporting.
Material was edited in connection with the statement of police that Lamba is ringing came to service 911 after Shmidt's murder and also because though Lamb also spoke about Prentiss as about the wife when it called in 911, information that they were married, was not confirmed.

Glava of the UN declares that the military solution in Syria does not exist
The secretary general Ban Ki-moon declares in response to rendering military support of Syria by Russia that for almost five-year conflict "the military solution does not exist", and growth of arms will only aggravate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The head of the UN called all participants, including the divided UN Security Council again, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find the political solution.
Ban Ki-moon declared at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans a meeting with Ministers of Foreign Affairs of five permanent members of council - the USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month for discussion of Syria.
It expressed a regret that disagreements in council, and also among Syrians and local authorities "made a situation unsoluble".

8 results of poll which show that Donald Trump does not joke
Some tried to label on it the provoker.
Others waved away from it, having apprehended as a joke.
And some demand scandal.
But as some republicans try to shake a high position of Donald Trump in results of polls, they did not manage it (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump's advantage in two-digit figures, and some begin to ask seriously that it means to the real estate mogul from the point of view of chances to receive the nomination.
Of course, it only beginning of an electoral period.
From this means nothing that Trump has chance to be nominated Republican Party.
Experts points that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry conceded the preimshchesvo to Herman Cain gaining popularity, nobody of which won also one state in the course of nominating.
Also there is a set of the reasons for which he would begin to fight on a general election.
But external groups, such as "Supercommittee of a political aktinost" of Jeb Bush, and the economic conservative group "Club of Growth" recognize the indefatigable strength of Trump and begin to get the dollars to overturn it.
Here some figures of polls which say that the real estate mogul - not just intermediate phase:
The ratings of sympathies for Trump made 180 degree turn.
Just before that as Donald Trump announced the candidacy in the middle of June, poll at the Monmouth university showed that only two of 10 republicans were positive to this real estate mogul.
To the middle of July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six of 10 republicans are positive to Donald Trump.
About three from 10 say that they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators win at the initial stages.
Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of republicans there polozhtelno concern to Trump.
Would arrange two thirds voting for GOP with Trump as the candidate.
In CNN/ORC survey conducted last week, 67 percent of republicans told that they or were "enthusiastic", or with "satisfaction" if Trump became a candidate.
Only two from 10 say that they would be "upset" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates approximately the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say that they would be "enthusiastic" against 40 percent of those who tell the same about Trump).
Following on a level of enthusiasm?
Marko Rubio who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of republicans say that they "will not be satisfied" or "are upset" if the favourite of an establishment Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.
Most of republicans do not consider Trump's temperament a problem.
While Trump is criticized in large quantities for his boasting and insults, 52 percent of the voters inclining to republicans through the whole country think that the magnate has a suitable temperament to be the president as showed poll of ABC News/Washington Post held on Monday.
The same figure appears at the country's first closed meeting in the State of Iowa where the same 52 percent of republicans think that at it that person who can be the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he is not that person who can be effective on a post, and nearly six of 10 independent voters say that his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to messages of ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to this thought.
When they put on the hats of experts, republican voters think that Trump is seriously.
On a question who the most probable winner in the GOP nomination, four from 10 told that Trump was a favourite, according to CNN/ORC poll last week.
It already not so when four of 10 put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full exposure: Voters of GOP had no correct magic crystal earlier.
In the same time in last cycle a cycle four of 10 republicans chose Rick Perry as the most probable candidate whereas only 28 percent supported the possible candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it shows that a great number of voters of GOP consider Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if republicans would rally around other candidate, Trump still ahead all others.
Some experts specify that such dispersion, most likely, plays on Trump's advantage, and at the same time not supporting Trump are evenly distributed among the supporting more than ten other candidates.
But survey conducted by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in the hypothetical competition "in private" between Trump and most of other republican candidates, Trump almost always gets support of the majority.
It is ahead of Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marko Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and, at last, Rand Paul, Jonah Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
It has a draw with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who bypasses him?
Ben Carson overtook the businessman on the whole 19 points in the hypothetical competition "in private".
Slightly more than a half of supporters of Donald Trump say what they changed the mind.
The new survey of CBS/NYT conducted on Tuesday shows that only the more than a half voting, supporting Trump say that they are sure of the voices.
Obviously, a lot of things can occur and change a situation, and nobody can tell actually what he will never change the mind.
46 percent say that they leave a door open for other candidates.
In that N less, the most intense competition at Trump at the moment - with the colleague outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say what they changed the mind, most likely, will choose Trump.
Six of 10 republicans say that they agree with Trump concerning immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "tyrants" in the performance opening a campaign two months ago, the subject of immigration became the most urgent in a talk in 2016.
Disturbs some that Trump's peacockery will avert key voters of the Latin American origin from Republican Party and will interfere with rebranding.
But according to ABC/Post survey conducted on Monday, six of 10 republicans say that they agree with Trump in questions of immigration.
Therefore until immigration draws general attention, it seems, that Donald Trump will remain on the same position.
The disappointment with the government gains new steam.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson count on support approximately from a half of republican voters, mainly, because of the status outsiders now.
Six of 10 republicans on Monday new poll of ABC/Post declare that they want the political outsider rather, than the person with experience in the government.
And they are also offended to Washington.
Poll of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa held two weeks ago shows that three from four republicans in Iowa are disappointed with activity of republicans in the Congress, at the same time 54 percent "are not satisfied", and 21 percent "in rage".

Meanwhile the decision of the leader of labourists to stand is silent during performance of the national anthem on service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75 anniversary of Fight for Britain sparked criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and became a subject of several editorials in newspapers.
The decision of Mr. Corbyn not to sing a national anthem drew attention
The press secretary of Mr. Corbyn declared that he "stood in respectful silence" and recognized "heroism of the Royal Air Force in Fight for Britain".
However the member of shadow cabinet of Mr. Corbyn Owen Smith reported to Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of labourists to sing the national anthem "independently" from his belief in need of cancellation of the monarchy.
Nearly ten of shadow ministers refused to play in team of Mr. Corbyn, sounding disagreements concerning economy, defense and international policy whereas less than one sixth members of parliamentary party supported him as the leader.
The political correspondent of BBC Robin Brant says that political disagreements also "are saved by a pile" in Labour Party after appointment of Mr. Corbyn to a position in the European Union and restrictions of compensation payments by the government.
Mr. Corbyn declared at a conference of Trade unions that the Labour Party made the amendments directed to cancellation of the idea of restrictions in general.

Mr. Corbyn declared that Angela Igl, the Minister of Economics in shadow cabinet, will replace it on questions of premieres-minstru when it is absent - for example when Mr. Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea to allow other colleagues to take the floor at an opportunity, having told that he addressed the speaker of the House of Commons John Berkou to discuss this question.
Having become the leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron declared that he wants to leave from political style of the "an exhibition buffoonery" which is often associated with the procedure of questions to the prime minister, but recognized several years later that it did not manage it.
From the moment of the first broadcasting in 1990 questions to the prime minister became a key indicator of views of the leader, their ability to operate the House of Commons and reputation at other members of Parliament though critics declare that it turned into a caricature and demands large-scale reforms.

Is staked much as in South Australia and Western Australia shops under the IGA brand make nearly 30% of all shops Metcash and show higher profitability, than Metcash IGA network in Eastern States.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as adherents of habitual routes therefore the market is more favorable for retailers of IGA here, than in states New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in YuA and 24 percent in WA in comparison with about 14 percent in Eastern States.
However analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, consider that Aldi will beat off 5 percent of the market of food in these two states within 12 months after opening of the first shops, taking away sales volume from all present players, but mainly, from independent retailers.
In the report published this week Tom Kierath, the analyst of Morgan Stanley, considers that retailers of IGA can lose on sales 360 million dollars in a year, and Metcash - 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on an assumption that Aldi next year will open 25 shops in SA and 30 - in WA, having achieved sales on 500 million and 600 million dollars in these markets respectively.
Losses of revenue and sales volumes of food at the high level of constant expenses of Metcash about 13 million income before payment of percent and taxes can cost the companies, Mr. Kierath considers.
At the same time, Metcash loses a share in the market in Eastern States, mainly, because of Aldi and Coles and this with the fact that the recent research of the Morgan Survey company found out that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley considers that sales of food of Metcash will drop by 3,8 percent in 2016, for 4,1 percent in 2017 and for 2,1 percent in 2018, having reduced a share of the company in the market from 14 percent in 2015 to 10,3 percent by 2020.
Last week the top share manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, noticed the attendee at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "can with high probability disappear within a decade.
The Metcash company refused to comment on comments of Mr. Douglass publicly.
But it is supposed that the board member of the Metcash company contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA share in the market decreased since 2010 from 18 to 14 percent, and the income of Metcash from business in the sphere of food which the company delivers to about 1200 retailers of IGA dropped by 43 percent in comparison with 2012 owing to operational deleveraging and in view of pressure upon indicators of sales and profitability.
Nevertheless, the company is not given, spending more than 150 million dollars annually for the sake of equalizing of retail prices with the prices in Coles and Woolworths one thousand positions weekly and helping retailers of IGA with a reorganization of trading floors, and also offering quickly extending range of fresh products and more wide choice of specialty food.
The CEO of Metcash Ian Morrice says that equalizing of the prices and re-equipment of floor spaces gains steam, and hopes that the company will achieve increase in net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of Tennis Australia Steve Hili
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor, but not criticism for the behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis indirectly suffered in recent scandal over his friend Nick Kyrgios and for the behavior deserves honor more, than critics as the president of Tennis Australia Steve Hili speaks.
Kokkinakis, younger in the talented duet and often called "Special Ks", involuntarily came under the spotlight because of a shameful skirmish of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka on the Montreal Masters tournament.
Soon after that, during the hot qualification match in Cincinnati the judge on a tower had to separate twice Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, at the same time Harrison declared: "Wawrinka had to lay on Kyrgios's shovels, and I have to lay on shovels of this guy".
Since that time as Kokkinakis last time saw breaking a racket after the spasm in his leg saved Richard Gasquet from possible defeat on US Open, Hili faithfully protects Kokkinakis.
The young man is in Glasgow now, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomic in singles in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I sharply worry about one thing, namely the fact that Thanasi was involved in the conflict", - Hili told.
He really broke a racket when at it cramped a leg on US Open, but he is not the first player who broke a racket when hopes fell, and I know Thanasi rather well to be sure that he would not begin these to be proud.
But actually he was self-controlled very well in quite provocative situations in US, with Harrison, etc., and I am sure that it is credible.
It is surrounded by excellent team, it has a fine family, and I just think that treated him a little unfair.
He is very mature 19-year-old person, he works hard, perfectly fits into team, it never had problems with other players, he is respected out of court, he intensively trains, it in an excellent form, he is very purposeful and developed young man, and I think that it should be appreciated.
Hili also supported the decision to forgive Kyrgios for the sake of the important match beginning on Friday, believing "mutual consent" the correct exit for all, but expecting that the guy from Canberra will return to team as the long-term player.
"First of all we want that the team completely concentrated at a match, but not on disputes around [Kyrgios]", - Hili told.
And I think that Nick gained strength very quickly that is proved by people like Federer and Marreya, it grows in the face of public, he made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all that criticism that he receives, but we try to help it to realize consequences of the actions, and it is necessary, I consider, to bring him out of the center of attention to some time that he could reflect over them, and it is the best of all for team and is the best of all for it.
Migratory crisis in Europe: Hungary declares emergency situation, closes border, detains migrants
Having declared state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked border with Serbia on the southern border and detains those who try to get into the country illegally to constrain the flow of migrants flowing inside.
On border there were disorders - hundreds of migrants crowded in the border territory what the Serbian authorities sharply negatively reacted to.
Having got stuck for indefinite time on the section of the road between check-points of two countries, the people running from the armed violence in the homeland pitched tents and located on this area.
However the discontent increased.
When over them turned the police helicopter, migrants shouted "Open border!" also cried out insults to the Hungarian police of special function.
Some in protest refused food and water.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary when them arrives from Macedonia and Greece more and more.
Serbia wants to be a part of a solution, but not accompanying damage.
It is necessary to hold negotiations with Brussels and other countries in the next few days", - declared in Prague Ivica Dacic.
Disorders on the Hungarian-Serbian border began next day after the block from 28 countries could not develop the general immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to bear shared responsibility for 40 000 people who are looking for shelters in the crowded Italy and Greece and hoped that in the future (next month or by the end of the year) the agreement according to which member states of the European Union will accept 120 000 more refugees, including refugees from Hungary will be reached.
The German chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded to organize next week the emergency summit of the European Union for discussion of the immigration crisis which captured the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for fast actions from Brussels or neighbors.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday conferred in two southern regions to the authorities more powers on actions concerning crisis that allowed them to block roads and to accelerate lawsuits about granting a shelter.
Meanwhile the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Wengija Petter Siyjarto declared that his country plans to build also a fence from a barbed wire on the site of border with Romania to block a flow of migrants through the country, now, when it finished a fence on the Serbian border.
The correspondent of CBS News Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were connected to urgent work on end of a fence from a barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
For the last several months Hungary became main "bottleneck" and the border crossing point of the European Union for immigrants, many of which are refugees - the victims of wars in Syria and the countries of the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the prime minister of the country Viktor Orbán insists that most of the people arriving in the country are the economic migrants who are looking for more safe life, but not refugees - the victims of military operations which have the right for protection, and this point of view sharply disperses from opinions of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws which came in Hungary into force at midnight consider a crime crossing or damage of a 4-meter (13-foot) fence from a barbed wire built by the government along the southern border with Serbia now and also include longer prison terms for defendants in human trafficking.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency", - the representative of the government Zoltan Kovac in the southern city of Szeged declared to journalists.
We accurately let know: illegal crossing of border - a crime.
Formally the parliament still has to authorize placement of military forces that is expected next week, but reporters of Associated Press who are on border, within several days observe presence of the military personnel armed cap-á-pie with vehicles and dogs there.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's adviser for national security, reported about capture by authorized bodies of 45 people trying to cross the border on the border, and 15 more people - within the country.
They crossed border, having broken a fence, are in custody of police at present and are accused of commission of administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities quickly restore a fence.
The Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of seven passes on border with Serbia, having driven the railway car wound by a barbed wire for blocking of one of passes.
Disorders flashed on the main pass through border near the city of Roszke (Hungary) as Hungarians placed the office for the admission of people in a metal container, and crowds of people pressed each other to break inside.
About 20 persons managed to get inside, at the same time thousands of people remained outside.
One more group of migrants blocked the main highway conducting from Serbia to Hungary and announced the refusal of food and water until they are allowed into Hungary.
Elections of 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders was cut by half in national poll
The former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold two-digit advantage in a race of democrats for the nomination through the whole country, but senator Berney Sanders catches up with it.
Clinton has support in 47 percent among primary democrat voters now (from 58 percent down), and Sanders goes the second with 27 percent (from 17 percent up).
The vice-president Joe Biden who did not announce yet whether he is going to participate in a presidential race gets support of 15 percent of primary democrat voters.
For more than five months prior to rivalry on primary elections most of democrat voters say that else too early to say that they decided on that candidate who will be supported.
Supporters Clinton are more sure of the choice, than podderzhvayushchy other candidates.
Since holding poll of CBS News last month Clinton lost support of some demographic groups, and Sanders achieved some bonuses.
Clinton holds big advantage among women and moderate, but this advantage was reduced.
Its support among men significantly fell, and Sanders lags behind it on only 5 points.
Preference given Clinton by democrat voters up to 50 years disappeared, and they with Sanders now as equals.
However Clinton still has big advantage among more senior voters.
Last month Clinton overtook Sanders on two-digit number among liberals, but Sanders has advantage in 5 points in this group now.
Nearly a half of primary democrat voters through the whole country say that they with enthusiasm would support Clinton if it became the candidate of this party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
It is possible, no wonder that present supporters Clinton, most likely, will show more enthusiasm into its account.
Among those who at the moment do not support Clinton views are more contradictory - only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support her.
Whereas 48 percent of primary democrat voters say that they with enthusiasm would support Clinton, the smaller number of republican voters tell the same about the leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When to supporters Clinton is set an open question why they want to see the candidate it, the most popular answer - that it has the necessary experience (16 percent), then - that now the woman president's time (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 percent).
Also supporters Clinton speak about the association connecting it with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also is called to the soglayena on questions and chances of election.
As the vice-president considers potential participation in elections, 57 percent of primary democrat voters would like that he joined a race - though a third considers that it does not follow it.
When they are asked whom they would like to see on the second place among candidates from the party, primary democrat voters in most cases call Biden.
Among supporters Clinton more than a half says that they would choose Biden as the second, it is more, than at Sanders.
If Biden decides not to propose the candidature from Democratic party, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders will be increased from 20 points with Biden among participants of a race to 30 points without it.
Fifty five percent of democrat voters see in Clinton the candidate with the best chances of a victory on a general election; however this figure decreased from 78 percent last month.
On this indicator Biden with big lag on the second place, but percent of those who consider him the most probable candidate increased.
Nevertheless, answering a question that it is the most important in the candidate, democrat voters choose other options besides chances to be elected.
Similar to a situation last month, none of candidates of democrats or potential candidates are not an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Candidates of democrats, or potential candidates, showed good result on some key characteristics among primary voters from the party.
The majority considers Clinton, Sanders and Biden the honest and credible people having high leadership skills.
Biden from all three is in the lead on honesty, and strength Clinton in its leadership skills.
Thirty percent of primary democrat voters do not consider Clinton honest and credible, is twice more, than those who tell the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no certain opinion on it in this respect.
Primary democrat voters also in general consider similar ideological views Clinton, Sanders and Biden.
To all these measures about a quarter of democrat voters have no opinion on Sanders.
Though questions of rather personal box of e-mail and the server at Hillary Clinton during the stay of her Secretary of State proceed, most of primary democrat voters are satisfied with her explanation in this respect and consider that it did not affect negatively their general opinion on it.
But it another story altogether at the American public in general.
A half of Americans are not satisfied with her explanation today, and about a third are satisfied only.
Opinions of the public on it were shared in March shortly after this history became known.
Most of Americans say that polemic concerning e-mail did not affect their general opinion on Clinton in any way though 36 percent say that their opinion on it worsened.
Generally it is republicans, more than six of everyone 10 who claims that their opinion on Clinton worsened.
Even thus that Clinton consider honest and credible voters from its party, it continues to be a problem for it among the registered voters in general: only 32 percent consider it honest and credible, is eight points lower in comparison with last month, and on 15 in comparison with May.
Sixty two percent of the registered voters do not consider it honest and credible.
At the same time 55 registered voters through the whole country do not consider Trump honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump both, however, receive good marks on leadership skills.
From six tested candidates Biden, Carson and Bush show the best result on honesty.
The majority see rather honest person in Sanders, than is not present, but as about Carson, many have about it no opinion.
The mistake limit for selection of 351 primary democrat voters makes 6 percentage points.
By results of national poll Ben Carson came very close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson closely approached Donald Trump in the last poll of CBS/New York Times
Two of these candidates collected a half of votes in new poll, having left all others in search of a support under legs
Republican voters through the whole country continue to support in large quantities Trump whose percent of support increased from 23% in the recent survey of CBS conducted on the eve of the debate on Fox News last month to 27% in survey conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson flew up for the same period from 6% to 23%.
Poll also showed that Carson enjoys support in all demographic groups, having pressed Trump in group of republican voters with the higher education.
Other candidates, except for Carly Fiorina and the governor of Ohio John Kasich, were rolled away back together with the governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
The former governor of Florida Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and senator from Florida Marko Rubio together take the third place from 6%.
The mistake limit for selection of 376 republican voters in this latest poll makes plus or minus 6%, survey was conducted in September.
The recent poll of CNN/ORC published last week showed Carson's growth in polls - having shown support of 19% among republicans, for Trump from 32% of support.
The last poll of ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump significantly is ahead of Carson.
Due to growth of support of Carson last week Trump made several critical attacks to the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for the fact that he called in question Trump's belief.
"We need energy", - Trump last Saturday in closing-time of a campaign in Iowa told.
Five members of a brotherhood are accused of the death of the first-year student of Baruch College
About two years later after death of the student of college during the dedication ritual in a brotherhood in Pennsylvania charge of murder was brought in the mountains Pokono against five people.
"Members of a brotherhood of Pi Delt Pxi from the New York Baruch College cruelly attacked Chang of "Michael" of Denga during a dedication ceremony in September, 2013 and did not take him to hospital in time that caused his death", - reported in police.
Officials say that the student blindfold and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind the back several times was pushed while he tried to achieve the objectives, going on a slippery surface.
M-r Deng eventually complained that it is hurt by the head and then fell unconscious.
Members of a brotherhood of Pi Delt Pxi did not call in 911 when Deng fainted, and waited still presumably hour before taking him to hospital, tell in police.
They, however, found time to replace Denga's clothes, to find its symptoms in Google and to communicate with Andy Mengom, the national president of a brotherhood to ask council as the police chief Chris Wagner told at a press conference.
"At this moment members of a brotherhood began to hide personal property, in essence, putting welfare of a brotherhood above Michael Denga's health", - the chief Wagner told.
It could not be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the report on opening, Deng got several stupid injuries of the head, trunk and hips.
"Too many families suffered as a result of dedication rituals in a brotherhood as at least one student perishes during them every year, since 1970", - Douglas Feierberg, the lawyer representing a family of Deng said in the statement.
Brotherhoods and their members have to bear responsibility, and this step from the authorities is very important.
The jury counties of Monroe favored charge of murder of the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty two other members, including m-ra of Menga, will receive charge of violence over the beginner and collusion.
"We want to make responsible not only certain participants, but if there is an organization which authorized all this officially or informally, then and it", - Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday declared.
Baruch College forbade a brotherhood, and the national brotherhood expelled local office from the structure.
What happens when the Federal reserve raises interest rates
There will be an increase in rates, and "the market of bulls" will stumble, bond yields will grow, and the economy will fall down in recession.
We know it.
What we do not know, so it what is the time will pass before approach and as long it will proceed.
Specifically for economy history explains about time little.
Recession occurred in only 11 months after the first increase in rates and for the whole 86 months.
Rigidity of the Federal reserve in a raising of rates often, though not always defines reaction of economy and financial assets.
Therefore the administration of the Central bank of the USA so persistently emphasizes that investors should not be focused on when it begins to raise the stakes, and on that how many adaptation will borrow.
Really, in a game a set of variables.
Eventually, however, participants of the market can find out that all vanity around increase in rates is exaggerated.
"The first increase in rates the Federal reserve with approach of global financial crisis will be inevitably interpreted by some as a signal of the end of an era of "cheap money", - Julian Jessop, the chief specialist on the international economy in Capital Economics, in the comment for clients reported.
On the contrary, we do not expect that gradual return of interest rates to the USA to more normal, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse of which many are afraid.
It does not mean, however, that consequences will not be.
Here a view of how some fields of economy depending on historical tendencies could react:
As already saw the market for the last month or about that, expectation of increase in rates can result in instability for some time.
At increase in a rate, however, consequences usually not such drama.
"It is unlikely that the income from actions braked for 12-24 months after the first jump that, besides probably reflects a delay in monetary policy" - analysts of Deutsche Bank in a recent research of results of increase in rates the Federal reserve told.
If is more concrete, the market for the last about 35 years more often sharply changes - about 14 percent - towards increase in rates, remains rather equal within 250 days after that (the average height of 2,6 percent), then, after 500 days, 14,4 percent for the last six cycles, according to the recent analysis which is carried out by Bob Doll, the chief specialist on the strategy of stock trade to Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's come back to the normal state with average profitability.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends to become more expressed at a stage of increase in rates not at once, and the income from actions begins to decrease.
Recessions are the fact of economic life, but increases in rates often play them promote.
In this case the Federal reserve is put in such conditions which did not exist earlier and can accelerate recession.
Generally the gross internal product will be almost in the lowest point for all the time of existence of the raised rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases povyshenya rates since 1950 only twice nominal annual GDP was lower than 4,5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter 2015 it was 3,6 percent very few people believe that it for a long time, thus that in the third quarter it remains at the level only 1,5 percent, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increase in rates on such unstable economic a background can be risky and raises the question "whether will be this time in a different way", reported in Deutsche.
Participants of the market prepare for increase in rates by the Federal Reserve System all year, at the same time their all eyes are attracted to a meeting of Federal committee of the open market which comes to an end on Thursday.
So far many specialists in strategy and economists consider that FOMC could approve increase in rates at this meeting, future trade speaks about only 25 percent probability.
"In our research since 1950 all cycles of increase in rates till today were in a supercycle of the increasing financial leverage at GDP blocking the peaks preceding recession, very quickly after the beginning of restoration", - it is said in the report.
By contrast, it was extremely slow restoration after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle at the moment - the longest for which the Federal Reserve System waited since the end of the last recession; the record made 35 months, all it lasts 74 months and did not end yet.
The fixed income also became unstable while the market expects increase in rates, and this scenario is to some extent similar on that which is implemented for actions.
Basic difference such is that in for bonds the effect will come quicker, than for actions when the Federal system changes a strategic course.
In case of bonds it seems that profitability changes a vector at once after approach of the first increase / reduction in rates in a cycle.
At the end of a cycle of increase in rates bond yields immediately fall", Deutsche reports.
Specialists in strategy from Charles Schwab believe that increase in rates will lead to the fact that levels of profitability of long-term and short-term bonds will approach, having made a curve of more flat.
Bonds with high profitability often behave better in such climate though "all of us still are afraid of profitability fluctuations", - the analytics of the fixed income in Schwab is said in Kathy Jones's research.
It is interesting that Jones considers that the markets already adapted to the expected results of policy of Federal system.
"In addition to strengthening of dollar and falling of inflationary expectations there are signs that the market adapted to prospect of more tough monetary policy", - she wrote.
Interest rates for short-term loans were raised, a profitability curve more flat, credit spreads extended, volatility increased - all characteristics of the market when toughening policy of Federal system.
Speaking generally, the companies doing the main business in the USA will be benefited from increase in interest rates, and local production will become more attractive.
The international companies with a set of debts will fall into the worst state as the growing dollar does their production more expensive in world market space, and their debt more expensive - in financial.
"History shows that "qualitative" actions show efficiency above market within three months after initial increase in rates", - analysts of Goldman Sachs in the report for clients told.
The companies with a stable financial state bypassed the companies with an unstable state by results of each increase in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 on average on 5 percentage points.
The companies with high profitability of the capital, and also an action with low volatility also showed the best efficiency, than actions of poor quality, on average on 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will become a big question.
The companies with high percent of a debt with a floating rate will lose most of all, according to Goldman.
Besides purely exchange transactions, consumers will receive benefit from the growing dollar.
Investors could see profit also through higher profitability though experts disperse in that, how fast it will occur.
"BBC Radio 3 - the copy of Classic FM", - the member of parliament from conservatives Andrew Bingkham claims
The member of parliament from conservatives Andrew Bingkham scarified the station for "decrease in standards"
Proves that it becomes less distinguishable from the commercial competitor
Also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award is torn simply off with Brits
The colleague from parliament Damiyen Collins who fell upon The Voice with the same criticism was not original
"BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM", - the leader of members of parliament declared, inducing broadcasting company to prove that it does though something that is not done by business firms.
The member of parliament from conservatives Andrew Bingkham also declared to the management of BBC that it seems as if the public radio station "grows stupid" and becomes less distinguishable from her commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I do not like to use the word "simplification" - but it seems, it turns into Classic FM", - he told.
He also aimed at the award BBC Music Awards started last December.
The BBC Music Awards which started last year looks as The Brits under other name.
So if you try to make something other - here two examples that the first occurred to me in which you actually only copy what already is in the market", - Bingkham told m-r.
The CEO of BBC rejected charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is ahead far of the commercial rival when business concerns live music and education of audience.
I do not learn what I learn thanks to Radio 3 about classical music more anywhere.
And his devotion to live performances and creation of music actually will not be compared more to anybody.
"It is also really very important, I think, interest of Radio 3 in search of new music and in promotion of new works", - he told.
Earlier this year the manager of BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey claimed that the radio station should work much more to attract audience, than in the past because British are less formed in classical music.
However Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC which took the battering for treading to heels to commercial competitors during hearings of special Committee on culture, mass media and sport.
The member of parliament from the Tory Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical show of talents which BBC redeemed from the Dutch Talpa Media for estimated price in 22 million pounds sterling.
You see why this program is often discussed due to the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the show BBC 1 in which as judges Paloma Faith and Boy George participate was made in "typical style of BBC".
He added that he wants from Corporation that that "found a hit in own house stable" next time when it starts the entertaining project.
However he does not consider it necessary to interfere with the order of new seasons of The Voice in the future or to use of money of those who pay licensing fee, on other entertaining formats.
Growth of Internet sales was as much as possible slowed down in August and the cause is there can be a Black Friday
In the first three months 2015 increase in online sales by seven percent was observed
Last month the slowest growth was noted since began to watch it in 2000
Online sales became more active due to use of mobile devices for shopping three years ago
Experts are convinced that November Black Friday could promote control of expenditure
Within about ten years virtual shopping tests a boom, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost towns.
But experts say that now signs of alignment of online sales appeared after the latest data showed only seven-percent increase within the first three months 2015.
The general expenses on online shopping in August showed the minimum growth since they began to be fixed in 2000, having increased only by five percent.
Experts say that now signs of alignment of online sales appeared after the latest data showed only seven-percent increase within the first three months 2015
"If you look at growth rates in previous years and will return back by 2000, then they always found a reasonable explanation", - Andy Mulcahy, the editor of an index of sales of IMRG told Guardian.
He explained that online sales became more active three years ago when buyers began to use the mobile phones for shopping.
It meant that even more people had an opportunity to buy online and that they could do it in any conditions, for example, sitting on a sofa.
But now it comes to the plateau, and you can see decrease (growth).
The phenomenon of Black Friday which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons of delay of sales.
Experts believe that buyers could abstain from purchases on the eve of the event which takes place last Friday of November.
Last year buyers in quantity hurried five times more average to computers to manage to take advantage of favorable offers, having brought down thereby a number of websites of sellers.
Experts consider that Black Friday when buyers enter the real fight for favorable purchases, could force people to abstain from shopping
According to the research published by British Retail Consortium a little more than 1 pound sterling from everyone 5 are spent online.
As for such goods as TVs and washing machines, it is more, than one third them is on sale through online stores.
At the same time more than a quarter of people buy clothes and footwear online more willingly, than in boutiques on the central streets.

Other victims will receive a half of this sum.
The head of B&Q claims that the trend is explained by presence of the East European masters working for small money
According to Veronique Laury, British even more often employ specialists in repair
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe grows
Result - opening more than 200 new shops Screwfix for experts
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q shops warehouses through the whole country
Author: Rupert Steiner, chief city correspondent of Daily Mail
They say, British put aside hammers and paint brushes, and instead employ the qualified Eastern Europeans for performance of work in the house
If you are able to handle the hammer or to dexterously paint walls, apparently, that today you in minority.
Because, according to the B&Q company owner, British everything cheshche employ specialists masters for performance of simple housework.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher owning network of services for arrangement of the house reported that behind this trend there is an essential inflow of the qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering services in minimum prices.
As a result of Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops specializing in goods for masters and at the same time to close 60 B&Q shops warehouses.
Mrs. Laurie told that she would like to see more women as a part of personnel of B&Q shops as eight of ten decisions on purchases in shop are accepted by women.
Now most of personnel - men.
According to her, it is necessary to notice also the recent demographic trends which are characterized by the fact that the quantity of the households consisting of lonely women who are engaged in arrangement of the dwellings more, than in the past grows.
Mrs. Laurie told: "In our shops mainly men still work.
It is necessary to take steps to achievement of balance.
In general, a half of our clients is made by women, and 80 percent of decisions on the acquired goods are accepted by women.
Women play a large role in decision-making process.
Mrs. Laurie - one of five women who are at the helm the leading British companies whose actions are considered in the FTSE100 index - also changed line-up of the team of top managers, having achieved among directors of equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher - nearly only company, in which exactly 50 percent of managers - women, including the general and finance director.
Mrs. Laurie told: "It was the conscious decision, diversification - an important question for us.
It was simple to find suitable women in the board of directors.
After the group footed the bill on closing of shops, the Kingfisher company showed decrease in profit and sales volumes for half a year.
As a result of this trend of Kingfisher, Screwfix owning brands and B&Q, opens 200 new shops
Decision-making time on an interest rate of the Federal Reserve of the USA
The world watches the meeting held by Federal Reserve Bank at which within two days adoption of the major decision is discussed - to raise or not an interest rate for the first time for the last decade.
Survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters revealed that a little more than a half of those who last week considered that the Federal Reserve will go to it believe now that it still will wait a little and will keep a rate at the level of the current range of 0-0,25 percent.
This historical event as passed seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered a rate to zero.
For the first time we approach that the main bank can move from a zero mark and begin process of normalization of interest rates", - Angel Ubide, the leading expert of Institute of the international economy Petersona declared.
The economy of the USA works effectively, economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However the Federal reserve cannot ignore how the decision will influence world economy.
He prevented the markets that it is necessary to prepare for changes, but everything speaks about their confidence that every chance against such step.
CET on Thursday will be announced the decision at 20:00.
New Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" - chant hundreds of refugees at check-point Horgos on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday Budapest blocked border for immigrants.
Seekers of a shelter already begin to probe other options of routes to the European Union.
One of them bypassing the closed border with Serbia lies through Romania.
Another - through Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some information, buses which carried refugees from Serbia to Hungary go to the city of Sid on the Croatian border now.
Drivers received the order from the authorities to follow without stops.
The Serbian Minister of Internal Affairs Nebojsa Stepanovich assures what his country is done by all depending on it to help refugees, but its opportunities are limited:
Our work is in securing Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we have to help also these people, provide the humane relation to them.
But it is already all-European problem.
To solve it it is difficult, no country in Europe alone will cope with it and the more so such small country as Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open border for refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán is unshakable:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia he has to fill in documents necessary for this purpose.
And if he does not make it, then and our country he will not be let in because in Serbia it is quite safe.
Hungary already built a 175-kilometer fence on border with Serbia.
But Orban on it does not intend to stop: he plans to erect the same obstacle on border with Romania.
Bucharest already declared that it is incompatible with the European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us".
Vangelis Meimarakis was included into the right-centrist governments which brought according to left, the country to financial crisis for a number of years.
Now it, having become the interim party leader "New Democracy", throws down a challenge to Tsipras.
Some days before elections it met the journalist of Euronews.
Euronews: Mister Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: I thank for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago your party suffered crushing defeat, having conceded to the coalition of SYRIZA, but now, judging by polls, "New democracy" was made even to it in popularity.
What changed during this time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece, and we changed too.
Mister Tsipras lied much in January of last year.
Nine months ago Greece had a surplus of the budget and the prospect of economic growth.
Now at the country again budget deficit and high unemployment rate.
Investors left because mister Tsipras banished them.
For the last nine months Greeks had an opportunity to estimate family way in which the country was in January, and false promises of mister Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare promised with what really happened.
Everyday life became much worse in comparison with January when the situation improved, and it concerned most of the Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that you in case of a victory on elections will aspire to the unions with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The matter is that as we understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is not casual that programs for rescue still work in all other countries where worked or, political forces and all ruling parties gathered to realize the program according to which they reached consent, without refusing at the same time the political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at a present stage only cooperation of political forces and institutes will allow the country to go forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in support of the agreement between mister Tsipras and creditors of the country.
If on Monday you become the new prime minister whether you will implement this agreement, or will try to change it, at least, partly?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Actually we voted for the movement of Greece on the European way because well we represent to what pernicious consequences would lead a country exit from the EU.
Now Europe helps us, providing subsidies to our farmers for their production, we have funds of solidarity, Juncker's package and the help in the banking sector.
All this would be lost if there was no contract with Europe.
But present measures of austerity became result of how mister Tsipras conducted negotiations.
I know that Europe does not wish to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government within the first year in power wants to bring order, works rationally and lets know that the country has a strong political will on implementation of the program of rescue, then, I am sure, all assumed obligations which cannot be executed because lead to recession can become a subject of negotiations again, but only later certain time.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of operation of the new agreement we will be able already to return to negotiations with our creditors as they expect full implementation of the arrangement.
If we want to regain their trust, we have to continue privatization, reforms and structural changes which were coordinated, continuing to take advantages of financing of the EU and great investment opportunities which we have to open for the best understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during negotiations Tsipras's government did not present any serious arguments on many key political affairs that we found out, discussing these questions with our European colleagues.
I can give the example connected with the income of farmers.
We explained to our European partners that this is not about the fixed monthly income and therefore it cannot be taxed completely in advance.
We were answered that Tsipras's ministers never spoke about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and badly informed, and therefore unsuccessfully conducted negotiations and concluded the unsuccessful agreement.
Euronews: If you win elections, then will appear at one table with mister Juncker, Hollande, madam Merkel and other European leaders soon.
Whether what you will tell them will differ from what was told them by your predecessor Antonis Samaras?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014 we tried to implement in the best way the agreement of 2012, bypassing the acute angles which were available in it.
We advanced reforms.
Of course, we lacked necessary determination and speed, but we acted in force majeure.
The market fell, and it was not visible the potential buyers ready to pay the price arranging the Greek government.
I at that time was a speaker of parliament, I managed to coordinate opinions of three parliamentary groups making then the government majority.
And despite their serious ideological disagreements under key bills, we had a working parliament, and it in the presence of populists and extremists, and also the mass demonstrations which were taking place outside.
And we managed to remove the country to a normal situation which would continue to improve if process was not interrupted with the early general election which became result of December presidential elections.
Euronews: The last weeks across the territory of Greece the mass flow of refugees moves.
What do you think of this situation, and of reaction of the European countries in which these people aspire?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Crisis with refugees is a time bomb with which we should deal after the victory on elections.
And the reason is that the government of SYRIZA did not work in this situation as followed.
In such questions it is necessary to affect an advancing because if the problem overtakes you, then there are only emergency measures.
And we now in such situation.
Even the provisional government which replaced SYRIZA in only seven days made more, than mister Tsipras made in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of provisional government to which the president of the republic who urged to hold the EU summit gives valuable help will allow to find the solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice - refugees not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events which happened to them.
This question has deeply humanitarian aspect, and we will adhere to a position which the European politicians have to accept in this new situation.
The relevant decision has to be made at the EU summit, also the United Nations has to be involved.
We also need the best coordination of actions, more effective border control and the centers for reception of refugees.
We also have to use effectively the economic help which we receive from the EU to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mister Meimarakis, thanks for an interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: I thank you.

The person who opened fire at the University of the state of the Delta left a note with apologies
After firing and murder of the girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before it shot and killed the colleague later on the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note in which it is said that he "regrets" for the first murder and would like "to return everything back", reported authorized bodies on Tuesday.
The police in the city of Gautier, Mississippi, reports that the teacher of geography and social sciences at the University of the state of the Delta, called service 911 about 10 o'clock in the morning.
on Monday also reported that he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needs to send people to him home.
He reported: "Last night I killed the wife", and also mentioned that in the house there is "doggie" who "will touch nobody", but is probably upset.
The police took an interest in a name calling, but he did not call it.
Lamb did not explain why he opened fire.
Having arrived to the crime scene, the police found Amy Prentiss's body, 41 years there, and the handwritten note from Lamba, 45, in which it was told: "I regret I would like to return everything back.
I loved Amy and she only who ever loved me.
Having written a note, Lamb passed 300 miles to the University of the state of the Delta where killed Ethan Shmidt, the teacher of history, and in the evening on Monday when it was surrounded by police, committed suicide.
The rector of the university William LaForge reported that he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Shmidt, but "at Mr. Lamba something was obvious on mind".
Despite information which arrived on Monday that Lamb assumed the novel between Prentiss and Shmidt official services on Tuesday reported about "lack of any information or proofs" of "a love triangle".

According to the summary, Lamb posted on the university website, spring of 2015 received at the University of the state of the Delta a doctor's degree in the field of pedagogics.
The stars which lost the good luck
The actor (at the left), in the photo with the son Redmond (on the right), worried several difficult years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost the long-term companion of life Farrah Fosett who died from cancer.
As it is reported, the actor also suffered from a drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All this, certainly, played a role.
Luke Shaw left Manchester United for several months because of a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke the right leg in two places during the match of the Champions League in which Manchester United lost PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender worries about it because of which he will not be able to leave in the field at least within six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play in this season again.
The trauma occurred during a reckless tackle of Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw rushed into a penalty area of PSV.
He was given help in the field within nine minutes and gave oxygen before taking away in hospital.
Van Gaal told: "It has a double fracture, and it in hospital".
It will be transported to Manchester tomorrow or one day later, and then operated.
It is awful - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18 years, overcame great difficulties and began to play extremely, and here it happened.
In a locker room on it there was an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it for six months, and the guy will not be able to play in a group stage.
I hope that it will be able to play in this season again.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and the penalty was not awarded.
The arbitrator Nikola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal considers that the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge when I say that it costs a penalty and a red card.
It was very bad tackle from two legs.
On the twitter Shaw writes: "Thanks to all for your messages, words not to describe how I am devastated, my way to restoration begins, I will return even stronger, than was".
On a subject: Manchester United endures misfortune with Luke Shaw at defeat in a game with PSV
At the defender of British will be additional incentive to recover to the European championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the coach of PSV, told: "It is very severe injury".
When any player leaves with a similar trauma, all are very upset with it.
It never was intention of our players - to injure the opponent.
Moreno was transferred by a fracture of the leg when played for Mexico against team of Holland under the leadership of Van Gaal in the World Cup of 2014.
"Now it is very difficult for it as it had no intention to wound the opponent and when you hear that it is very severe injury, you feel badly", - told Cocu.
I had no opportunity to see the moment.
The only thing that I could see, is a ball which flew in other direction so it looked as if it (Moreno) concerned it, but I did not see a tackle under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6 told Moreno: "I know what is it, I know how it is difficult to transfer it.
To me it is very heavy, and it is a pity to me.
Andrés Guardado from PSV was also taken to hospital after collision with Chris Smalling.
Whether David Cameron knows something else about Lorax?
Each parent very quickly acquires one thing: if your child liked any book, there will pass a little time before you leave to know it almost by heart.
Probably, if only you not David Cameron.
Answering a question of the representative of the company which is engaged in the organization of children's rest on vacation, of the loved children's book, the prime minister chose Lorax - the fairy tale with an ecological bias written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was the difficult choice, Cameron in the comment published on the website of the SuperCamps company wrote and continues: "I like to read this cheerful, touching, unusual story with the strong message to the children because in it some image or the message which we miss is always found."
And everything is good, except the last paragraph in which Cameron as it is supposed, retells contents of the book, but actually tells a plot of the film of the same name shot in 2012 with the new characters and details added to diversify quite short original narration.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded with high walls where there were no greens and even air was on sale for money, the boy by the name of Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart - girls of the dream, having granted her desire - to see the real tree", - we in the text read the description of a love story unknown to Dr. Seuss (a real name Theodor Seuss Geisel) who died in 1991.
If it looks insufficiently suspicious, Cameron's text is read almost like the summary of a plot of the movie "Lorax" uploaded to the website Internet Movie Database: "In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded with high walls where everything was artificial and even air was on sale for money, the boy by the name of Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart - girls of the dream."
It seems improbable that Cameron, being, admittedly, an active parent, is so unfamiliar with contents of the book in which not called by the name of the boy he learns about how the greedy chopper of trees and the knitter "vsemnuzhek" destroys by Nakhodkins the environment, despite Lorax's protests (whose name is taken out in the name of the book) - a ridiculous being with moustaches which "speaks on behalf of trees".
Most likely, such simple PR-task was charged to the performer never reading to the child the book about Lorax the 20th time in a row.
The representative of the Downing street declared that the text presumably was received from Cameron's office in the constituency.
The SuperCamps company confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but further comments did not follow.
For Adam Lyth there was obviously a risk not to get into English national team, but all this still a difficult question
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates - a difficult task, but if to look on the national team which England selected for this tour at repetition of defeat in a test series with the score 3-0, the incident last time, does not seem to me probable.
I would also not exclude a victory on the home field.
Alastair Cook's team, perhaps, is less skilled, than that that was three years ago, but in it among beating off there are players who are masterly accepting spinners, and the collective thinking is strong; they will not bring with themselves scars from 2012 but only a youthful positive.
With a ball Moyen Ali turns into the bowler serving spinners, and Adil Rasheed even if it the unknown figure for test level, represents the attacking option.
On a subject: Adam Lyth left English national team on test cricket and is replaced by Alex Hales
The decision on Adam Lyth's exception to me, his head coach in Yorkshire, certainly, it is difficult to analyze.
Two good attacks in difficult conditions, and obvious, but cruel reality that players are estimated at cricket by judges by result fell on its seven test matches.
There were no questions according to Joe Root, for example, as led to this announcement because (and I already told it earlier) players best of all choose themselves.
Couple of fifty, and Lyth could wait more long career, but he was in the power of own destiny.
We hope that if it gathers more ran for Yorkshire, one more opportunity will appear.
The head coach of English national team, Trevor Beyliss, praised his spirit, even when it did not show what it is capable of, and it does not surprise me; he is first of all a command player, and then already all the rest.
The question, what is the time will pass before the batsman of test cricket leaves about himself impression - a difficult question.
Lyth played in seven games, as well as Sam Robson to him, and Nick Compton - in nine.
Only Compton got chance to play on the and on the foreign field.
The only thing what you could complain of - the fact that England chose Johnathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier league when Lyth was in the best form, but this lost opportunity already in the past.
There is Alex Hales, and he is a batsman whom I highly appreciate.
He is an unpredictable cricket player that we also saw in the Yorkshire club at the beginning of this season when he earned 236 in a match against us from the Bridge Trent platform that there was already something.
The same opportunity has to be at least given it, as well as those who was to it, but it, of course, will depend on team's line-up in the UAE.
To put a thought Moena near Cook as the opening batsman that would give the chance to enter additional spinners, having kept four high-speed bowlers, is considered, and I at all not against it.
I do not see the reasons for which the beating player cannot return a ball there, and this lefthander already showed that he is devilishly good cricket player.
Moen, perhaps, not absolutely what is necessary for the County of Worcestershire, but became the third number for them, and there is no big difference here.
My old team mate Justin Langer played the first 38 test matches "the third batsman" before leaving as opening in 2001.
He won at once three hundred and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the national team as reserve spinners, and at my short communication with it he seemed me very promising young man.
People can look at its approximate statistics - on average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball - and to think that it is a risky rate, but among the spinners voting pro a little, and selecting chose youth.
He will learn much in this tour.
Besides the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions in trainer's structure.
Makhela Dzhayauordin's appointment, the shri-Lankan batsman, as the consultant for test matches, could be the masterful course.
It one of the best guys for a game who will introduce in it the wealth of experience got under all possible conditions and in any attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy, and ruthless speed in a set up.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in the international cricket, whether it be a game or trainer's work, and as Makhela, has considerable intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in a locker room even if they say what was already told earlier, can give new forces to team.
The colleague Kolli at the command of Durham Ben Stouks is left for a something ephemeral, the similar break in connection with Australia is provided to Root, and I, for example, have about it no problems.
Though not all will agree with it, the trainers and persons selecting players do not define the schedule.
And you have to remember how players, their positions depend on results.
Such decisions are never made easily.
The camp of supporters of an exit of Great Britain from the European Union can win a victory if the economy is in a depression by 2017
The unreasoned policy of David Cameron on resumption of negotiations about preservation of Britain in the EU experiences every day more and more difficulties, even without thinking about ingenious Jeremy's election - "It yes or no?" - Corbyn the leader of labourists or indignation of TUC concerning Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have the of Korbina and Naydzhela Faradzhi too.
The friendly European diplomat explained the other day that at that situation in which there is the EU enduring various crises now - not all from them own production - some member countries are full up the British egocentric agenda of the concessions sowing conflicts and the changes undermining arrangements which they generally do not want.
Having gathered in Brighton on an annual meeting, TUC decided that he does not want them anyway if they destroy social protection.
We could even call it "the program of a selfie of Dave and George".
The prime minister and the Minister of Finance ride on the summits and bilateral sessions in the foreign capitals, photograph himself against the background of the known local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or without it, then come home and say that they attract allies to reform.
All this about me.
My European friend who wants Britain interested in maintenance of external contacts under an awning of the European Union - "Do not abandon us together with France", tells Berlin - offers that blinkered ministers and officials in some capitals reached understanding when it becomes all the same, there will be we or will leave.
Angela Merkel, very careful German chancellor, - the ally, but she is in power 10 years and wants to leave an office before the situation for it worsens as it worsened for sat up on the place with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
The head of France François Hollande faces re-elections or replacement in 2017.
It loses force too.
Poland can soon receive the nationalist government of the right sense, Spain - left.
It is heavy to see them going all out to help "selfie-britam" whose energy could be spent on prevention of an exit of Scotland from Great Britain - what they do not want too because the majority has similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers can even plan issue intentionally of useless notes in SNP style during the referendum campaign in Great Britain in 2017 to urge on process of an exit of Great Britain of the EU, my friend assumes.
"Revision was fixed idea" and "Britain received nothing valuable from the resumed negotiations".
Europeans on the trouble know what predator can be Fleet Street and as skeptically in relation to the EU media moguls are ready, unlike times of the referendum started by Tony Benn in 1975 which supported our introduction in 1973 by a ratio 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the inveterate Euro-opportunist who became famous for the "direct bananas of the EU" of the Bruxelles correspondent at the beginning of the 90th.
At all the nonsense Ed Miliband knew who his enemies.
They included speckled group from the afraid taxes of swindlers, telephone hackers strangers and pseudo-nonresident who own the majority of our large newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair was about them absolutely the same opinion, but realized that when you are in a cage with a violent gorilla, you have to give it bananas to distract it and not to allow it to eat you for a lunch and once again with tea.
Upon Miliband there was a bigger adherent of Blair, than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea about a referendum as Blair renounced the principles in favor of the repealed constitution of the EU buried by the French and Dutch voters in 2005 who issued it the advantageous ticket.
The press of nothing from this forgave it.
But a milyag Jeremy Corbyn who friendly clapped me on a back in Westminster on Monday - I told it that it has no time any more to spend it for me - probably, risks to repeat Neil Kinnock's strategy "boycott to Murdoch" from the 80th - a mistake both then and now.
It can take time, but he has to develop consecutive strategy of interaction with the press - not with me, but absolutely precisely with Andrew Marr on whose sofa in the Air Force he sat on Sunday.
Official position of Corbyn across Europe is what I delicately call evolving.
He speaks, he would like that we remained in the reformed EU.
Really, most of people outside a tradiotsinalistsky tendency of Ukip and more wide range of "supporters of small England" among the Tory can probably tell on it "yes".
It the same that Hilary - "Benn, but does not bennit" - Benn told on radio and TV this week, at the same time his internal boy scout very much refused to recognize that appointment of intolerable John McDonnell as Corbyn as the "shadow" Minister of Finance was the bad idea.
It reminded me about the 70th years when his old man father very much fought on TV for disloyalty to colleagues on a labor office, without going too far and without losing the post in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But fight for remaining "under any circumstances" - Benn's phrase - not that, McDonnell said and not that Dzh. K. spoke to peers and members of parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, in general opinion.
That there the democrat and "the guy" Corbyn wanted to report - you remember, it touched even me - the discipline of messages remains important in a century of the round-the-clock television seven days a week, and especially in a whirlpool of social networks, the center of paranoia and treachery.
It is reasonable - not to give it to Cameron so simply to get off Europe, allowing it to take for granted support of labourists during the campaign for holding a referendum as McDonnell told.
Simon Jenkins definitely so thinks.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's main delusion concerning membership in the EU - within "Bennite" economy of the besieged fortress - any more is not a question of an esoteric discussion among the left dissidents for whom the narcissism generated by insignificant difference is the central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his delusions concerning NATO - Tom Watson is unshakable that Dzh.K. will not agitate for an exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to inform of it the heads at home.
Why to Paris or Berlin to spend the political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions of Britain when all this can be senseless?
The USA is already very disappointed with weak military operations of British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even while the government of the Tory in power cuts down expenses what reminded me on Monday during a lunch on somebody a forum under the name British Influence Security of.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
Statements of the agency financed by the government that electronic cigarettes for 95% are less harmful, than smoking, were heard at a meeting of 12 people some of which are connected with the tobacco industry as researchers reported.
The experts who are published in British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with the Lancet scarified the proofs used by the Public Health England (PHE) agency in the report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the important report - "a rotary milestone" last month, having called it "a comprehensive review of proofs".
But some researchers called into question reliability of data and pointed to connection of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In the editorial article in the medical magazine Lancet last month scarified "extremely shaky argument" on the basis of which PHE constructed the main conclusion.
In the article BMJ two more researchers asked a question whether have these statements under themselves "the firm or unsteady bases".
Martin McKee, the teacher of the organization of the European health care at the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine, and Simon Capewell, the teacher of clinical epidemiology at the Liverpool university, reported: "The fundamental principle of health care - rules have to have the proof of efficiency in a basis".
According to them, the public expects that statements of PHE that "the current best assessment shows that electronic cigarettes for about 95% are less harmful, than tobacco smoking" were based on detailed analysis of proofs and modeling.
Actually, it is brought out of the only meeting of 12 people who gathered for development of model of the multi-criteria analysis of decision-making to generalize their opinions about the harm connected with various nicotine-containing products; results of a meeting are in brief given in the scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that the company under the name EuroSwiss Health about which CEO it was reported that earlier he received financing from British American Tobacco for an independent research was one of sponsors of a meeting.
He also confirmed certificates of BAT in health sector in the sustainability report.
One of 12 people at a meeting declared financing from the producer of electronic cigarettes, without mentioning that financing which he as he is reported, received from the tobacco company Philip Morris earlier.
The reasonable explanation of the choice of members of council was not provided, but among them there are several famous supporters of electronic cigarettes some of which also declared financing of the industry in the publication.
It is unknown whether other participants of a meeting have an experience of management in tobacco business.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco direction in PHE.
The scientific article published by group "gracefully agrees" that there is a lack of "strong evidences of harmful effects of the majority of products by the majority of criteria", McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, any of these communications and restrictions were not mentioned in the report of PHE.
McKee and Capewell told that statements of PHE that "currently there are no proofs that electronic cigarettes are the road, leading children or non-smoking to smoking", are premature.
The prof. Kevin Fenton, the area manager on health and wellbeing in PHE, told that on statements of BMJ answers were already given earlier.
He told: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful, than tobacco smoking".
One of two smoking all life died of the addiction.
All proofs mean that threats to health from electronic cigarettes are rather small, but we have to continue to study the remote consequences.
PHE has an accurate obligation for informing the public concerning what is proved and what is not proved by these proofs, especially where the public had doubts concerning relative danger in comparison with tobacco.
About 80 000 people a year die of the diseases connected with smoking, and smoking costs NHS 2 billion pounds a year.
It is clear having designated obvious - that though electronic cigarettes are also not safe, they do only a part of the harm done by smoking - we carry out our tasks before the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 considers that the BBC company has to stop series EastEnders
The former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson considers that BBC should stop release of such programs as EastEnders and The Voice, having noticed that their competitors on business would give a lot of things for such successful shows as the soap opera about "Albert Square".
Johnson noticed that licensing fees have to be used only for creation of such programs which are not issued other British broadcasting companies.
He criticized BBC for the fact that the company puts transmissions of public broadcasting which are watched for certain by only a small part of audience, for peak broadcasting time when competitors have shows with high rating, and on such channels as BBC4.
After the CEO of BBC Tony Hall told that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he in due time within six years unsuccessfully tried to set up cooperation with BBC in operating time on Channel 4.
"I cannot escape the thought that BBC prepares for start and broadcasts transmissions which could show the competing companies not receiving subsidies", - Johnson told members of the committee on communications of the House of Lords within clarification of the future of BBC.
If you keep licensing fee that I do not consider the good decision in the average and long term, then the company should leave on air only those programs which are not issued and are not going to be issued other companies.
The show The Voice airs on a prime slot because creators want to get the greatest possible support on the future.
The idea that nobody more it showed, is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I do not understand why regressive taxes have to go for financing of transfers which could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice - one such example, EastEnders - another; it is well-known that they own production.
Other channels, undoubtedly, for it would give a lot of things.
I do not understand how it can be public broadcasting.
I do not think that it somehow would belittle BBC.
The serial businessman Johnson heading Channel 4 channel from 2004 to 2010 accused BBC of a pursuit of ratings "because of ambitions of employees and because of their belief that it is the best way to catch support for long term".
His comments on the most popular shows on BBC have something in common with comments of the executive director of Sky Tony Ball who in the lecture suggested BBC to sell to MacTaggart's memory in Edinburgh in 2003 EastEnders series.
Johnson noticed that more niche transfers of BBC of public character "continue to go on BBC4 where often it is impossible to estimate audience, but function of the company is executed, and it can be shown as an argument in the sanctimonious sermons justifying the income from licensing fees in 4 billion pounds: "well, of course, we make all these unclear transmissions which nobody watches".
They put them in the slot where nobody will never watch them.
Concerning licensing fee Johnson reported to committee the following: "I urge you to find more regressive system as for who most of all will receive from it.
Of course, all of you think, all of us think that 150 pounds a year - the huge sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds - big money, are interesting to me they so consider because they not really look and listen to BBC.
The former executive director of Sky and Channel channels 5 David Elstein who addressed committee last Tuesday too, told that BBC Rita in advantage has to reconsider a mission "inform, educate and entertain".
He noted that now only an insignificant part of the released BBC materials formally is classified as educational - according to him, it is 1% of television content and 0,1% for radio - and that the company has to take up an initiative of the Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies under the motto "inform, educate and entertain".
Concerning partnership Elstein noticed that BBC should make more efforts in such spheres as "Promenadny concerts" (only part of them, according to him, is shown on TV) and also to enter alliances with the business broadcasting firms to make them available to viewing online.
"Sonogenetics" allows to operate cells of a brain by means of sound waves
On the video it is visible how nematodes change the direction of the movement at the moment when they are affected by sound impulses.
Scientists brought worms with genetically modified nervous system which can be operated, using ispulsa of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change the direction of the movement while influence them sound impulses, too high that the human ear could hear them.
Impulses make impact by activation of the neurons which are genetically modified to use membrane channels which react to ultrasonic waves.
On a subject: Researchers operate brain activity by means of light
Scientists told that worms show possibilities of a new technique under the name "sonogenetics" which essence consists in use of ultrasound for excitement of certain cells of a brain, heart and muscles, at the same time the source of ultrasound settles down out of an organism.
Chalasani's Shrikant, the research associate in Salk Institute, La Jolla, California, told Guardian that this technique could replace deep stimulation of a brain once - the invasive procedure at which electric impulses are sent to a brain of the person and which is used in treatment of a disease of Parkinson.
Hearts nematodes usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found out that they began to react when they were placed in the liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found out that bubbles strengthen ultrasonic waves which then get into an organism of worms.
The strengthened ultrasonic waves influence the structures called by "ion channels of TRP-4", found in membranes of some cages of worms.
Ultrasonic waves force these ion channels to open and excite cages which are connected with them, is reported in the report in Nature Communications.
For creation of nematodes which can be operated by means of ultrasound Chalasani made genetic modifications of worms so their motor neurons used ion channels of TRP-4.
During application of ultrasound for impact on the modified organisms sound waves amplified microscopic bubbles and were entered into organisms of worms, activating the modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that which is applied in "optogenetics" - the new direction which allows scientists to switch on and off neurons by means of light impulses.
Chalasani claims that in comparison with this technique sonogenetics can have some advantages.
Unlike light which is delivered to the necessary site of a brain on optical fiber low-frequency ultrasonic waves freely pass through body tissues therefore for their delivery it is not necessary to pass in a cranium.
"We consider that for treatment of some neurologic diseases in clinical conditions use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to make for a while human neurons sensitive to an ultrasonic signal", - Chalasani told.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscular and insulin - to the producing cages.

Advertisements scoff at the British traffic in arms
You watch a commercial of Amnesty International with a protest against an arms exhibition.
Tremendous drones murderers!
The iron shackles destroying a shin!
Cluster bombs!
The electric sveto-noise bludgeons which are causing intolerable pain, but not leaving marks!
The vigorous voice and the drawn animation do not leave doubts that this advertizing of the largest international exhibition of arms - the caustic parody prepared by Amnesty International with the purpose to draw attention to intention of the British government "to push" weapon to the repressive modes, having used the exhibition of defensive technologies and security systems which is taking place in the ExCeL center in Docklands.
On a subject: Exhibition of arms of DSEI: authoritarian regimes go to London
But the special campaign also leads to sudden emergence of a set of posters on bus-stops and in trains of the subway which demand to look at them once again.
"The important announcement, going through DLR from September 15 to September 18?" - it is written on one of them by fonts of the London subway with the image of the DLR line turning into a tank silhouette.
In September of this year the crowd of dealers in weapon will appear suddenly to the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help to prevent a weapon exhibition.
300 posters are drawn by artists who exposed the works in "The museum of cruel design" in Banksy's park "Dismalend".
Collective under the name Special Patrol Group helped to extend them across London, using "set of the burglar of the spaces", a 6-pound set of wrenches which as it is declared, "gives access approximately to a third of advertizing space on bus-stops of the planet".
To transport workers of London gloomily from such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, the curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and the teacher in the University of Essex, artists become more exacting and aspire to informing of political art audience outside galleries.
Many artists begin to work with activists of protest movements, understanding that they should leave to the real world for the sake of the art if they want to influence society.
One more poster against an exhibition of arms welcoming passengers in the subway.
Video from Amnesty was watched more than 100 000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by the VCCP agency working with pro bono, with involvement of the graphic designer and actor of dubbing, also working for free.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever was struck with advertizing silence around an exhibition of arms - with the admission in ExCel calendar - and thought: "Let's organize them a campaign which they try to avoid".
They thought to create more realistic and smart corporate advertizing, but "to fill her houses in bright colors and animation it was more fascinating occupation".
"They incredibly helped us to draw attention to sale of the illegal torment equipment at an exhibition", - says Volume Davis from Amnesty.
Now it is necessary for us that the government of Great Britain took measures and guaranteed that this torment equipment illegally will directly not be on sale at our threshold.
Perhaps, the most creative art on an exhibition of arms goes from within ExCeL where participants trade in extremely euphemistic production.

Eight golden rules of accommodation in dormitories
Already 11 years passed since I moved to the dormitory as the normal 19-year-old person who is still trusting in berets and a moral relativism, but only now I remember affected smiles of those whom I irritated - and numerous, long complaints to others.
Generally what I learned, can be spread out by eight simple rules.
Moving to the hostel can vary from slightly irritating to absolutely frightening.
He induces to stir: to tell people from where you whether you took the academic vacation and where carried out it whether you support Corbin and why you "honestly, neither I love, nor I hate "Marmite" because, seriously, children, it is just the XAXAXA barmy extract, I will be at myself".
Take rest.
Also help others to take rest too - ask questions and show interest.
It keeps up the conversation and helps you to find people who are pleasant to you, but not to what you would even not begin to talk even if you would sunbathe eyelashes, and they would distribute fire extinguishers.
Give to people space.
Rooms of people often turn into pubs, midnight cinema halls and places of the general parties, but they as well that place where people put on and correct underwear.
On a subject: Even do not think to begin study at the university, being in the relations
At the universities treat introverts unfairly.
Your room has to be a shelter, however many hostels form culture of swaying of one room in another that promotes friendship, to communication and conducts to the long friendly relations.
It can be hell for this purpose who tries to restore forces.
Nothing in culture allows you to tell: "You are pleasant to me, and I want to continue to be on friendly terms with you, but it is necessary to me that you left, and I could restore energy which I spent for communication with you".
Try to feel when the fellow student is tired with communication - and not to be knocked to it, and to send the SMS.
By the way, about knock: do it.
One guy in my hostel followed such principle: if the door was not locked, then he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends by means of pastries.
As you begin university life at the peak of popularity of the show Bake-Off, to knock at the door to people to be presented and present a plate of chocolate cookies, - any more not such strange action, not so reminds the 1950th years from them "Welcome, we are neighbors, I to you baked something, and now smile, and I will ask you private matters".
To offer house entertainments - an excellent way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel that they are obliged to chat with you, and as a result probably your person will be associated at them with a pleasant surprise.
Certainly, it depends on as far as you are a good baker.
Badly stuck together lumps of flour, sugar and fat will force people to pretend to be rather sleeping when you to them are knocked.
Theft of food - a typical crime in dormitories.
Certainly, assignment of someone's chicken - theft, but unless this theft - to take itself slightly milk for tea?
Cope with the owner of milk.
Most likely he will suggest you not to hesitate even if inside boils from rage.
If someone steals your things, it irritates, and I sympathize with you - but try to treat it is more adult, than my neighbor who poured in the milk liquid for washing of ware to revenge those who took it without demand.
Now it in prison.
You should not make noise which will prevent people to sleep or study.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are those people from a saying about glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to lower a drum sound and bass guitars as there were 3 o'clock in the morning, and at her in the morning examination.
In reply the neighbor increased loudness.
When he at last became silent at 5 in the morning, she graciously allowed it to sleep two hours, and then cut the music and locked for herself a door, having gone to three-hour examination.
Whether it was romantic if your future spouse lodged in the same hostel, as you?
On the contrary, it would not be extraordinary, to biting of elbows, clumsily if you took the neighbor for the future spouse, was fond of it, suspended relations and would have to see it every day, and it is possible, to observe as it draws all your mutual friends on the party?
Of course, the heart has a will of its own - but if the hot neighbor absolutely definitely not your future spouse, try to damp own ardor slightly.
At that concerning moment when you understand that someone left keys in own locked room, a side between a draw and persecution is thinner, than it seems.
Good draw - it is cheerful, but turns into the contrast for only a few seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting lesson of safety, having hidden something - but never soil someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock others door and lower keys in glass with water which you will put then in the freezer - but do not paste others things Blu-Tack glue to a ceiling more than two times.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on iPhone after release of updating from Apple
The new operating system can be requested, having come into the Settings appendix, to choose General, and then - Software Update.
If it is ready, phone will allow you to download it and to establish.
Some faced problems after installation when there is an error message saying to them that "Updating of the application did not work well".
To avoid it, it is recommended or to wait to users, revival will not cease yet, or to try to be updated through iTunes.
Hints on phone will allow you to undergo all process up to the end.
Process can include removal of applications for increase in an empty seat - but Apple minimized probability of this action, having reduced the amount of updating, and also simplified performance by means of the special utility which suggests to delete applications and repeatedly repeatedly to establish them after completion of process.
It is worth being convinced that when performing updating your phone is charged or is near the charger not to allow a battery discharge.
If the charge too low, Apple stops updating as phone discharge in process can lead to updating failure.

Washington responded to military activity of Russia with phone call.
The U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the Russian colleague Sergey Lavrov to discuss a situation in Syria.
In his opinion, military support which Moscow gives to the president Assad leads only to escalation of the conflict.
At the same time the head White at home is not going to speak about it with the Russian colleague yet, PJ Media writes.
The U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss military activity of Russia in Syria.
Reports the PJ Media edition about it.
"Kerry's secretary clearly let know that further support of the president Assad from Russia creates risk of an aggravation and extension of the conflict, and also negatively affects our common goal - fight against extremism, - if we also do not continue to concentrate on searches of ways of permission of the Syrian conflict by direct transfer of power", - U.S. State Department Spokespersons declared.
They also noted that once again emphasized with Kerry commitment of the USA to fight against Islamic State within the coalition from more than 60 countries.
He also noted that the president Assad will never be able to be her member.
Besides, the USA "will be glad to a constructive role of Russia in attempts to resist to Islamic State".
Last Friday representatives of the White House declared what they definitely do not know what actions are taken by the Russian troops in Syria, however Washington this question is going to discuss with Moscow.
However, the press secretary of the White House Josh Earnest noted that time for telephone conversation between the U.S. President Barack Obama and the Russian leader Vladimir Putin did not come yet: "When the president will decide that telephone conversation with the president Putin will do good to our interests, then he will lift a tube and will try to make this call".
Barack Obama considers the decision of Russia to increase support of the regime of Assad "a losing rate".
I remember our conversation with mister Putin four or five years ago when I told it that it is a mistake that further support of Assad will only worsen a situation.
"But he did not listen to my preventions - and as a result the situation worsened", - the U.S. President declared.
The imported yachts will exempt from payment of the customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to exempt temporarily imported yachts and other watercrafts for rest and sport from payment of the customs duties and taxes.
Corresponding changes in the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the ministry of an order of the Government of the Russian Federation.
About it Izvestia was reported by the Assistant Secretary of economic development Elena Lashkina.
In June, 2015 the prime minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev following the results of a trip to the Crimea charged to a number of departments - to the Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, Ministry of culture, the MFA, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, FSB, to FTS, Rostourism - to prepare offers on creating favorable conditions for yachting in coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is total absence of infrastructure for storage, service and the maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to store the vessels abroad - about €200 million annually go to treasury of the European states for maintenance, repair and service of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation prepared the draft decision of Council of the Euroasian economic commission "About modification of the Inventory, the customs duties which are temporarily imported with full conditional remission, taxes", providing full conditional remission of the customs duties, taxes concerning the imported yachts and other watercrafts for rest and sport.
According to the ministry, it, certainly, will promote creating favorable conditions for development of yachting in coastal zones of the country, - Lashkina noted.
The matter was submitted for consideration of a subcommittee on customs tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration which meeting took place in September, and following the results of discussion was also approved by departments.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure for full conditional release when importing is in essence a privilege.
Therefore after the approval of the minutes of a subcommittee in the government of the Russian Federation the Ministry of Economic Development will make the offer in the Euroasian economic commission for discussion with EEU member states, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods which are completely exempted from payment of the customs duties, taxes includes the goods necessary for rendering assistance of foreign economic activity and to the international cooperation, for application in the sphere of science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, for international assistance, etc. Among them - the office equipment (personal computers, typewriters), instrumentations, drilling equipment, scenic suits and scenery, mobile laboratories and workshops, a water ski, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious practices.
In the press service of Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation Izvestia were told that prepared obligatory resolutions on seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosiya and Yevpatoriya which provide the simplified order of registration of calling and an exit of small size, sports sailing and pleasure crafts in seaport.
Ministry of Transport gave instructions to captains of seaports of the Crimea to provide application of the simplified order of calling of small size, sports sailing and pleasure crafts seaport and an exit of the listed vessels from seaport.
Also Ministry of Transport prepared drafts of orders of the Government of the Russian Federation about the statement of borders of the water area of seaports of the Crimea.
Concerning Yalta and Feodosiya orders are already accepted, the others are in a coordination stage, - noted in the press service of department.
According to Ministry of Transport, concerning the small size vessels used in non-commercial purposes the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol have to carry out state control, classification and survey, state registration.
The problem is that in Russia extremely hard with yachting because of poorly developed infrastructure.
If to look at the South of Italy and France, then there it is the whole constantly developing industry in which a large number of people is involved.
In Russia actually everything stands still.
Our coast uninviting, the only piece where it is possible to operate all the year round yachts, is the Black Sea near Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But big complexity is that in this area extremely strict rules of the border service: in order that on the yacht to leave to walk, it is necessary to issue the mass of permissions.
Besides in Russia the yacht even has no place to refuel.
Two days it can go with the fuel, and then there is a problem where to take it, - the sales director of the Nordmarine company Denis Novikov says.
As for places for storage of yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg there are special hangars for yachts to 30 m now. Also yachts send for storage to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that buyers of yachts are rich people, however from the beginning of crisis demand for yachts decreased.
The World Bank allocated to Ukraine the credit of $500 million.
The World Bank approved the new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for development of the financial sector.
The press service of the international organization reported about it.
"New financing will support a number of priority measures for carrying out reforms in the banking sector in response to financial crisis in Ukraine", - it is said in the message.
The director of the World Bank of Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Qimiao Fan declared that reforms of the banking sector will help to revive the credits in real economy and will stimulate restoration of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities accepted the impressing steps on reform of economy and in the World Bank observe the first signs of stabilization.
But because of gravity of problems Fan calls the government of Ukraine for acceleration of reforms.
Earlier Polish government approved granting the credit of €100 million to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reports.
Prisons ask to create separate blocks for transgender people.
On Public council at the Federal Penitentiary Service (FPS) on protection of the rights of convicts in October, 2015 among other questions will discuss a possibility of creation in colonies of separate blocks for transgender people and transvestites.
About it Izvestia was told by the member of council Vladislav Grib.
In his opinion, depending on total in Russia the convicts who did not decide on a floor in domestic prisons it is possible to provide separate cameras, blocks or even (if is many such criminals) to create in the long term for transsexuals special colony.
However Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to define on departure of punishment of citizens to such isolated places only after convicts pass the corresponding medical examinations which will prove that the criminal really is the person identifying himself as the representative of an opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is sure that isolation of transgender people from other prisoners will ensure safety serving sentence.
According to him, the offered practice successfully works abroad: separate cameras for transgender people, and in correctional facilities - special blocks are provided in the pre-trial detention center (where defendants are before the judgment).
Today it is the only thing to do during the work with such criminals.
Unambiguously they need to be isolated as presence of transvestites and transgender people at ordinary cameras is dangerous to them, it sufferings for their families and an array of problems for the staff of FSIN.
Humiliations of trances from cellmates are guaranteed, - Vladislav Grib says.
Depending on that how large city, how many criminals with an uncertain sex, it is necessary and to count where them to distribute.
Pre-trial detention centers separate are definitely not necessary - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, the separate colony is possible if there will be a lot of transgender people.
As Grib explained, the block can contain 50 or 100 people and if the specialized case is created in Russia one, then the imprisoned transsexuals will be able to arrive on punishment departure there from any regions.
Citizens are held in the pre-trial detention center in the place of commission of crime therefore arrival of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects during the investigation and trial is unreal, and to here enter such practice for already condemned in separate colony - yes, - Grib considers.
Let's remind, the day before law enforcement officers could not solve to what pre-trial detention center - men's or women's - to define the 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov detained for possession of drugs (known under a name Alina Davies) because of what the man with maiden appearance was not arrested.
He was released home on recognizance.
This news was widely discussed on social networks and media as there is no mechanism of keeping of transgender people in the pre-trial detention center and colonies in Russia really yet.
The Russian human rights activist, the activist of the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolai Alekseev supported the idea of creation of special places for serving sentence by transgender people, having noted that definition of people in colony - men's or women's - depending on their own desire is abroad also possible.
Considering the atmosphere in the Russian prisons, the offer correct.
Yes, it is very small percent, but the problem exists as well as a question of providing in prisons of safety for homosexuals, - Alekseev says.
Prisons have to be safe therefore separate blocks could be made for the sake of it and for homosexuals especially as in prisons it is more of them, than transgender people.
At the same time Alekseev doubts that in Russia there will be many citizens ready to give itself for transsexuals to get in excellent from usual colony.
Of course, it is possible to enter medical examination before placing people in colonies for transgender people, but not always everything happens unambiguously.
For example, in the USA one of Chelsea Manning's prisoners looked as the man, and already in prison declared that he wants to change sex, - Alekseev told.
The person can feel as anyone.
But while there are no certain places for serving sentence for transgender people, I doubt that the staff of prison will think seriously of safety of such people and to penetrate into subtleties of their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time the international expert in reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze noted that introduction of new system of distribution of transsexuals criminals in colony can strongly delay the beginning of departure of punishment by convicts.
The commission is created - it is a sexology question, psychiatrists make long observations, it is not one test on the basis of which the high-precision conclusion becomes.
Today's opportunities of psychiatry it allow.
Therefore and before sex change potential patients pass always such examinations - they precisely show whether sex change with surgical intervention is a necessary measure, - Lordkipanidze says.
However it is difficult to me to present how to introduce this system in relation to convicts, on average on such inspection month leaves.
The doctor, in spite of the fact that in general supported the idea of creation of separate blocks for transsexuals, also doubts that he in present economic conditions will expediently allocate funds for construction of new rooms, medical examinations, - transgender people in Russia of unit.
It is difficult to count, there is no official statistics, but if to consider that homosexuals in Russia about 5%, then it is possible to tell that it is even less transgender people, and those who have such deviation and also commit crimes, at all insignificant quantity, - Lordkipanidze told.
Now according to the petition before administration of colony homosexuals, transgender people already can receive separate conditions of keeping.
Mikhail Antipov won the junior World Cup in chess.
In Khanty-Mansiysk the World Cup in chess among juniors up to 20 years came to the end.
The ending of superiority was given more than intriguing.
The winner was defined only in the last tour, and Russian Mikhail Antipov who managed to overtake after all for Pole Jan-Krzysztof Duda who seemingly surely went to a title became him.
At girls the victory was celebrated by the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buksa.
The World Cup in chess which was taking place since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk already to the middle of a tournament distance, appear, lost almost all intrigue as the representative of Poland Jan-Krzysztof Duda who gave a series from four victories (competitions are held on the Swiss system in 13 rounds), surely took leadership.
Considering that Duda was the favourite rating of superiority and in general the probability that he will miss the got separation is considered one of the most promising young chess players, it was represented very insignificant.
And even when Duda reduced turns and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to catch up the backlog to only 0,5 points, he remained the obvious favourite in fight for a title.
To Antipov to catch up with the leader, it was necessary to win by all means in the 13th tour.
But even it would not help, win Duda the party.
Plus this obligation of a victory, of course, could affect a game of the Russian chess player and lead to optional mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He surely coped with Francesco Rambaldi then he was forced to wait when the game is ended by Duda meeting with Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately for Antipov the Polish chess player drew opposition with the Dutch.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored equal quantity of points - on 10 of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
And therefore to it the leadership of Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug which governor Natalya Komarova, traditionally pays much attention to development of chess in the region awarded the first prize.
And here in competitions of girls of the intriguing ending it did not happen.
- Natalya Buksa (Ukraine) - for a title gain was not to lose to the leader of a tournament in the last tour enough that she with success also made.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol did not allow it to catch up with Buksa.
The Russian sportswoman remained the second with lag from the champion of 0,5 points.

Comfortable rate for investment loans - 10-13%.
According to the experts, the market of financing of small and medium business in January-April of the current year sank for 40%.
What, by your estimates, a situation today?
After panic moods of the end of 2014 - the beginning of 2015 volumes of crediting of SME considerably decreased.
The reason is clear: sharp increase in interest rates.
Crediting under 25-30% per annum was not favorable to anybody.
If earlier the bank could put in the raised rate all the possible problems further, from delays to non-returns, then now it cannot be made: rates already transcendental.
For business the current level of rates on the credits of SME is uncomfortable.
The current level is unacceptable for a considerable part of investment projects from the point of view of their payback.
Level of rates of 10-13% would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and to form on them attractive profitability.
As far as, by your estimates, demand of businessmen for the credits is satisfied?
After downgrade of the Central Bank of an interest rate the situation improved a little.
Credit resources became more available.
However, on our observations, clients began to apply for the loans much less often.
First of all, business does not understand the prospect of the development and future income.
Today at business one exit: it is necessary to learn to work, being guided by today's economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to keep track more attentively of the current results, to control cash flow.
At the same time in the presence of financial resources it is worth using the new technologies allowing to upgrade the equipment, to reduce costs of production and power supply.
All this, eventually, allows the company to make production of more competitive and to keep business even in an unstable economic situation.
What main tendencies of the market of crediting of SME will become stronger and will influence its development until the end of 2015?
Whether the interest rate will change?
The forecast for decrease in an average rate will depend in many respects on policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator shows the sequence in a question of decrease in a key interest rate.
However you should not wait for radical falling of the price of the credits for SME.
In the current situation a problem, first of all, is inflation which does necessary the raised interest rate for obtaining the real income.
Besides, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even at decrease in rates of the Central Bank.
If to speak about delay level, then traditionally the companies of small and medium business limited both in opportunities of replenishment of money, and in options of correction of economic behavior, certainly, will represent bigger risk for creditors.
I would not begin to expect essential reduction of a share of the bad credits.
The main reason - the international sanctions and their negative impact on national economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
The word Mazda is quite so written with the Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautifully, laconically and at the same time quite difficult for those who got used to Cyrillics or Latin.
And new CX-5 crossover, as, however, and any other model of brand: without pretentiousness it is attractive outside, innovative inside.
Japanese already just owing to "Japaneseness" it is capable to bring attachment to products of the Land of the rising sun to a condition of full delight.
It is possible to adduce as much as necessary arguments in favor of cars from other countries, and people even in principle will agree with these arguments, but all conversation will be scattered from the final phrase: "But same Japanese car!
And to argue there is nothing!
Such people probably have to love not only the equipment, but also all other Japanese.
To quote straight off the Bass, to season food of wasabi, to collect katana and to dress the girlfriend - no, not in a kimono, of course, and on canons of street Japanese fashion: lovely, creatively and very unexpectedly.
Perhaps, the Japanese school uniform - the only uniform which girls wear with pleasure and after leaving school.
It has surprising properties: at the same time both sensual, and strict.
And than the girl is more senior, that the skirt is shorter.
The main change in appearance of CX-5 - a front grille with five horizontal lines.
But far stronger the new drawing of headlights and back lamps by which the car is instantly recognized in a steam of cars changes shape of the car.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, forms sensual, but appearance at the same time has a severity raid.
It is not necessary to call the police.
Driving CX-5, one of the safest in the world, it is possible to feel only stoical Japanese tranquility.
The 2,2 l diesel engine provides high torque in the wide range of speeds.
At the same time fuel consumption of this 175 hp motor - only 5,9 l. The power unit is completed with exclusively automatic transmission and the four-wheel drive.
Black boots, black raincoat, black bag...
To add to this image of a little black humour, it is possible to choose leggings with a print from the police film Not Cross.
However, in Mazda made every effort that driving CX-5 you did not appear on the place of own road accident.
To increase even more comfort, having kept at the same time excellent controllability, at a suspension bracket processed a design of forward and back shock-absorbers, and also optimized a form of plugs of forward lower levers.
The system of the four-wheel drive is adapted under the Russian conditions.
Noise level from the road and the engine at high speeds is reduced by 13%.
The bathing suit in a floret or a strip is as boring as the budgetary sedan.
Other business if the girl sports in a bathing suit with the original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in a genre of the role fighter.
It then will get attention not less, than to new CX-5!
At new CX-5 the improved design of both forward, and back seats that provides an optimum stock of space and for big shoulders, and for long legs - who what possesses.
Still long-legged for certain will estimate that an emphasis in a forward part of the central tunnel soft and does not beat now anklebones in bends.
The broadest set of systems of active safety Mazda is offered on CX-5.
To distinguish potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used here.
There is both an adaptive lighting, and the warning of a descent from a strip, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking here.
At the Mazda CX-5 one of the best luggage carriers in a class.
The convenient, having minimum of ledges, it contains in itself(himself) freight of 561 l. Back seats develop 4:2:4 in a proportion - at the same time each section is supplied with a separate portable lever - and increase a luggage compartment to 1560 l.
Suit of the hero of the animated film in Japan call "kigurumi".
Especially fervently the kigurumi pajamas looks.
In it all is possible!
Of course to sleep.
But still - to entertain small children.
Or just to stroll such small animal down the street...
After all, it's wonderful when there is an opportunity to choose - cool clothes, a manner of behavior or the car.
We thank for assistance in the preparation of material Kawaicat shop.
Kiev broke up the atomic union.
Kiev officially issued refusal of Ukraine of cooperation with Russia on completion of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovnaya Rada on Wednesday from the second attempt nevertheless voted for cancellation of the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements on completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not succeeded to start implementation of the project.
On Wednesday the Verkhovnaya Rada of Ukraine adopted the law terminating the agreement with the Russian Federation on construction of the third and fourth block concluded in 2010-2012 on the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
It was succeeded to carry out the bill introduced by the government of the country only from the second vote, for the first time he was supported by 210 deputies at a necessary minimum in 226, but then after the revote 234 members of parliament supported the project.
The Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant inititated during the Soviet period on the initial project had to contain four 1 GW power units with pressurized water reactors, but managed to construct only two.
Negotiations with Moscow on completion led to 2010 to the conclusion of the intergovernmental agreement, in 2011-2012 Rada adopted the relevant laws.
As means in the budget of Ukraine were not, it was supposed that it is necessary to build blocks on the credit of the Russian side, but funds were not allocated.
After the revolution in Kiev in February, 2014 and the cooling which followed it in the relations of two countries Kiev began to phase out dealings with Moscow in nuclear sector, having announced the refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant and on the project of construction in Ukraine of nuclear fuel plant.
Purchases in the Russian Federation of fuel for the operating Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about a half from power production in the country) remained the only sphere where the relations remained, as to replace with still Ukrainian National Nuclear Energy Generating Company "Energoatom" the Russian deliveries there is nothing.
With other contractor in Ukraine still finally did not refuse plans of completion of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant: in 2014 in Kiev declared negotiations with Czech the Skoda JS.

Distributed to parties mandates.
Yesterday the election commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of elections to City Council on the municipal district, having distributed 12 deputy mandates played according to party lists.
Traditionally many complaints to violations during elections were heard from the representatives of the CPRF who accused electoral commission of "concealment of falsifications".
Remarks of opposition were not accepted.
At the same time the electoral commission refused to Communists of Russia party the organization of the referendum concerning cancellation of a payment for overhaul of apartment houses.
The city electoral commission officially presented results of elections to municipal duma of Nizhny Novgorod on the municipal constituency.
In total electoral registers in Nizhny Novgorod included 1,03 million people, voting bulletins to precinct election commissions 746,7 thousand were given, and voted on elections of 268 thousand voters.
More than 11,7 thousand bulletins, and 24 - lost were recognized as invalid.
Yesterday 12 mandates among political parties depending on the votes received by them were distributed.
According to lists of United Russia six deputy places in municipal duma rely Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of LDPR was received by the party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Two mandates of the CPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and the deputy of the State Duma Alexander Tarnayev.
Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin get three mandates of Just Russia.
Now within five days these candidates have to be defined whether they will work as deputies in City Council: in case of refusal from the mandate it passes to the following candidate on a party list.
The chairman of municipal electoral committee Aleksandr Makeev told members of the commission that he enters watches for "mailing of telegrams to Zhirinovsky and we designate" regarding refusal of mandates.
At the adoption of the protocol on results of elections representatives of the CPRF declared multiple violations.
The member of municipal electoral committee with advisory capacity from the CPRF Leonid Krasnokutsky suggested not to recognize vote results on four districts No. 21-24, having reminded that according to the order of the head of administration of Sormovsky district the entrance to the administration building where four district commissions were located was closed.
Inside long there could pass neither Gosudma's deputies, nor candidates, nor observers, and resonant scandal with storm of doors of district administration was shown in an air.
At meetings of the district commissions all observers and members of the commissions with advisory capacity had an opportunity to be present.
To them the head stopped access only when vote ended and yet precinct election commissions did not come to hand over the bulletins.
It was made for the purpose of prevention of different provocations.
"Then the head was corrected, and interested persons could be present at all meetings", - the member of municipal electoral committee Natalya Andryushina parried.
Communists objected that they illegally held more than four hours the deputy of regional legislative assembly Lyudmila Aristova in the blocked administration building concerning what the application is directed to investigative committee.
The opposition was also indignant that in a number of UIKOV in the election day began to seal up ballot boxes at 6-7 o'clock in the morning, spreading in them bulletins for early voting.
At the same time and observers nobody notified members of the commissions with advisory capacity therefore they came already by the beginning of elections at 8 in the morning.
Communists are sure that they before opening of polling precincts could throw in the morning bulletins in ballot boxes uncontrolledly.
However the municipal electoral committee which already considered more than 124 complaints in different occasions according to Aleksandr Makeev, did not find any violations with throws of unaccounted bulletins.
Members of the commission and the proposal of the colleague from Just Russia Maria Popova through regional election committee to leave with amendments of the regional legislation did not support accurately to determine time of opening of envelopes with bulletins of early voting which then get to a ballot box.
"As own initiative address though to the CEC", - advised Aleksandr Makeev madam Popova.
At the end of the meeting the member of the CPRF Sergey Samokhin shouting fell upon the chairman with loud charges that the electoral commission ignores tens of complaints and covers falsifications on elections.
"You here not on a meeting, declare more carefully!" - the chairman of electoral commission took offense.
As a result the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
Till September 27 the electoral commission has to approve the general results of elections then within three weeks the first meeting of City Council of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be appointed.
Except definition of results of elections the City Elections Commission refused to political party "Communists of Russia" registration of initiative group for holding a local referendum.
Judging by documents, Party members were going to submit two questions for discussion of residents of Nizhny Novgorod: whether they agree that charges for overhaul of apartment houses should "be cancelled immediately", and "to freeze tariffs for housing and communal services till 2020".
However the lawyer of a thought Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of Communists of Russia contradicts the legislation.
The revenue of FedEx has the mixed character, decrease in forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported on unfavourable results of the last quarter, and the giant of service of delivery reduced the forecast of annual profit because of decline in demand for services of a cargo transportation and growth of expenses in the division of land transportations.
Also the company declared that it plans to employ about 55 000 seasonal workers for holidays.
In the same time last year FedEx reported that it will employ 50 000 temporary employees for holidays.
Its actions fell in price approximately by 2,5 percent at the preliminary auction in 45 minutes prior to opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. declared that plans to earn from $10,40 to $10,90 in financial year which comes to an end next May that is 20 cents less, than in the previous forecast.
Analysts assumed $10,84 according to the review of FactSet.
Decrease in the forecast is observed despite raising of rates on average for 4,9 percent which will come into force on January 4, and growth of charges for land transportations heavy or cargoes within loading range which begins in November.
The company declared that it still plans growth of revenue in comparison with last year thanks to cut in expenditure, increase in gross revenue and growth of online trade.
The chairman and CEO Fred Smith declared that the company "worked steadily taking into account weak, in comparison with the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade".
Plans of hiring of labor on holidays were announced next day after the statement of the competitor, UPS, that they plan to hire in addition 95 000 employees, about the same as employed last year.
In a quarter which ended on August 31 FedEx earned 692 million dollars, is 6 percent more, than the previous year.
The income on an action made 2,42 dollars, is close to the forecast on average 2,44 dollars on an action which is carried out by Zacks Investment Research poll of 12 analysts.
The income increased by 5%, to 12,3 billion dollars.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks assumed 12,23 billion dollars.
FedEx suffered from recession in the sector of urgent international transport in recent years that resulted in lack of growth of gross revenue in its division of express transportations.
However the boom of purchases on the Internet sharply improved results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter the proceeds from land transportations grew by 29%, however the operating income was left whole without changes because of the raised costs of large departures and self-insurance.
The division of express transportations gained higher income because of higher base rates whereas the income fell in the cargo sector because of increase in labor costs.
At the preliminary auction approximately for an hour before opening of the exchange of the stock FedEx fell to $3,85 or 2,5 percent - to $150,15.
They closed Tuesday, having dropped by 11 percent in a year and 17 percent below than a record of June 11.
On the most anticipated for several years to a meeting heads of the Federal Reserve System will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from Honduran mahogany, deciding whether it is time to raise a key interest rate for the first time almost in ten years.
In one end of richly decorated room for meetings height to two floors over them the wall image of the United States will hang.
This card - a reminder that the chairman of the Federal Reserve System Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have to put economic interests of the country above all others.
The central bank received a double assignment from the Congress: as much as possible to increase employment in the USA and to keep here the stable prices.
But since Great recession heads of Federal system recognized that there is also the third, unwritten assignment: financial stability.
And this third assignment can be an unknown factor in almost predicted decision which will be declared on Thursday, whether the economy of the USA is ready to coming off the unprecedented incentive provided with almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even while the majority of data show steady growth of economy, recent shocks in the world financial markets can keep careful heads of Federal system from addition of volatility by a raising of a base rate for federal funds as it is - even only on a quarter of percentage point.
"It is obvious that labor market and inflation will become the first and most important subject of consideration", - told Lindsay M. Piegza, the chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co broker company.
"However I think that if they looked for the reason not to raise the stakes, the increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them a justification to wait further", - she noticed.
There is no consensus about what will be made in the Federal Reserve System that in itself provokes fluctuations of the financial market.
About a half of the economists who are recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted growth of an interest rate this week.
The financial markets, however, expect that the Federal system from it will keep, thus that the key indicator shows only approximately 30 percent probability of fast rise.
It can lead to stock market falling if the Federal system raises a rate provided that those who make decisions will not soften blow the promise that the following increase will be at a distant day.
On Tuesday the Dow Jones index rose by 228,89 points, or for 1,4%, to 16 599,85.
Take-off was provoked by expectations of the fact that the persons defining the strategy of Federal system will leave a rate this week, - John Lonski, the chief economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research group declared.
"Will be a surprise if the Federal system raises rates in this timepoint", - he noticed.
If the management of the Federal Reserve System acts this way, "they should come far in the adoption of the strategy to hold the financial markets in hand that they did not panic".
Other experts objected that increase in a rate could calm the financial markets as it will remove uncertainty on the subject of how the Federal system will work.
In total a month ago the Federal system, apparently, inclined to raise a rate for 0,25% this month, doing the first small short step in slow toughening of financial conditions that could confirm durability of restoration of the USA.
Yellen declared in the spring and at the beginning of summer that she expects increase in a rate this year, despite complaints from liberals that bigger economic progress is necessary.
Though emergence of new jobs in August was slowed down, growth of labor market was stable this year.
Unemployment was reduced to 5,1% last month that is the lowest indicator for more than seven years, and almost at that level which in Federal system is considered full employment.
Growth of the salary shows acceleration signs.
And, though inflation continues to be below the annual indicator planned by the central bank in 2%, the management of Federal system declared that the temporary effect of sharp drop in oil prices became the key reason.
The economy "can cope also with higher rates, and needs them, taking into account labor market reduction," - Ian Sheferdson, the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics noticed.
However worldwide began to shake the financial markets at the end of the last month after China devaluated the currency.
The average Dow Jones index for stocks of the industrial companies dropped by the whole 16% of rather record-breaking high value in May as investors were afraid that delay of the Chinese economy can slow down world growth.
The market partly restored the positions this month, and the Dow Jones index is about 10% lower than high May value now.
For the management of the Federal Reserve System market indignation in addition complicates difficult calculations of term of increase in an interest rate.
"In the absence of data on what occurred in the financial markets and news about weakness of the Chinese economy in the last several weeks they would begin to put the clamps at this meeting", - Stephen D. Oliner, the senior researcher of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and the former employee of the Federal Reserve System declared.
Now, according to its forecasts, they will wait, at least, for month to receive more control over consequences.
"There is a big uncertainty in what can be consequences for the American economy, and they almost have no reliable data after the latest events in China", - Oliner told.
Health of world economy is not included into the main cares of Federal system, and technically it should not be considered at adoption of these decisions.
But in essence the Federal Reserve System became the world financial power.
Influence of the Central bank was huge in recent years.
Only one hint from the chairman Ben S. Bernanke of that time in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System can "muffle" the monetary expansion, caused shocks of the markets worldwide.
In the world where the markets and economic systems more and more intertwine with each other, it would be possible to expect that heads of the Federal Reserve System will not only monitor succession of events everywhere, but also to consult with representatives of other Central banks and with experts better to understand world economy.
Their decision-making process - "it is rather an art, than science", - Zachary Karabell, the head of Envestnet Inc - the companies which are engaged in the global strategy of management of states noted.
Jeffrey Lacker, the president of Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve System there were cases of overreaction to the movements of the financial market which are, it seems, not connected with the economic principles".
Lacker, the member with the right to vote of influential Federal committee on the open market insisting on increase in a rate gave solutions of 1998-99 as an example.
Financial crisis in Asia led to the fact that the Federal system lowered the base rate by 0,75% for three meetings, "despite of the limited identified consequences for growth in the USA", - Lacker told.
A year later heads of Federal system cancelled these decrease.
The Federal Reserve System should put on the first place care of stability only at the time of big crises, such as as a market collapse in 2008", - Adam S. Pozen, the former member of the committee on establishment of an interest rate in Bank of England told.
The last panic also close did not approach this level, he told.
"You, of course, would not want to appear in a situation when you are frightened by growth of rates because the markets endure a shock", - Pozen, the president of Institute of world economy of Peterson told.
The law on the Federal Reserve System still has the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I do not think that they should advance events.

The speaker of the State Duma Sergei Naryshkin assumes that the USA intentionally destabilizes a situation in the Middle East that waves of refugees rushed to Europe.
As transfers Interfax, it expressed such opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar within the autumn session of Parliamentary Assembly of OSCE.
"I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question arises by itself: whether Europe is an ultimate goal of those who with such maniacal persistence destabilized a situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?" - it asked a question.
"For certain someone assumed and knew that flows of refugees, these unfortunate and the deprived who is saved from death will direct to safe EU countries", - he added.
Naryshkin took an interest: Whether "Many political leaders of Europe frankly spoke the reasons of this crisis, this wave of refugees which now literally overflows their countries?".
"No, old Europe, with rare exception, prefers to be silent", - he stated.
According to Naryshkin, NATO tramples on many European values and rules of international law.

Government troops and paramilitary forces loyal to them are resisted by the rebels consisting generally of Islamists.

According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and the sovereign states.
It would like to move away one person these countries and to put on his place another who will act for the benefit of the western countries, but not for the benefit of the Homeland, he noted.
Assad paid attention to a sharp turn of the western media from the beginning of a revolution in Ukraine.
According to him, for them the president of Russia Vladimir Putin "turned from the friend of the West into the enemy, the tsar, the dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition which came to the power in the non-democratic way in spite of the fact that he was elected as a result of the democratic elections recognized in the West".
Putin urged the world community to unite forces with Assad for fight against Islamic State.
Commenting on constant statements of the West that Assad has to leave, he noted that the president comes to the power with the consent of the people, through elections and if leaves - that upon the demand of the people, but not according to the decision of the USA, the UN Security Council, the Geneva conference or the Geneva communique.
"If the people want that it remained - the president remains, and otherwise it should leave immediately", - he emphasized.
Assad called Russia and Iran the friendly countries and reminded that with them cooperation is carried out.
Also Syria fights against terrorism together with the neighboring Iraq.
Speaking about military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noticed that this country supports the Syrian state in policy, in economy and in the military sphere.
He disproved statements that the Iranian military units go to Syria.
Tehran delivers us military equipment.
"Naturally, exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran takes place, however this exchange was carried out always", - he explained.
As for other states, we are open to cooperation with any of them in the presence of serious desire to fight against terrorism.
"We do not see it in a case with the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-ISIS coalition conducted by the USA", - Assad specified.
The death toll exceeded 230 thousand people, the number of refugees - 11,5 million.
The part of the territory was taken by the Islamic State terrorist group banned in Russia.

Boroday emphasized that he does not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken out on the territory of Russia by "connected".
I suspect that it is provocation.

"It is slander both on me, and on Strelkov", - he concluded.
Earlier on the The Washington Post pages there was article in which Borodaya that it took out Strelkov on the territory of Russia forcibly are quoted.

The Brazilian union of pediatricians of Rio Grande propagandizes healthy food for nursing
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS thought up a scandalous method by means of which it is going to convince women of need of good nutrition during breastfeeding: the method means demonstration of images of the babies sucking the breast painted with images of junk food.
Various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates from which children receive all nutrients necessary to them for formation of strong immune system are a part of breast milk.
Due to the high energy needs pregnant women and the given rise women are recommended to increase day norm of calories approximately by 500 calories a day.
However the recent research is shown that one increase in caloric content is not the only change of a diet which mothers have to make.
In the recent research conducted by Robert Waterland, professor of the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas it became clear that healthy food of pregnant women actually influences an expression of genes at children and prevents development of tumors in them.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy food on immune system of the child was revealed.

Enjoyed a victory two-three of days.
World champion in track and field athletics Sergei Shubenkov.
It is possible to call this season triumphal for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergey SHUBENKOV.
It managed at the crown distance 110 meters with barriers to win on a team championship of Europe, to set several records, and, above all - to become the world champion, and the first in the history of domestic barrier sprint.
Besides, recently the athlete won a final stage of "Diamond league", having taken the third place in the overall ranking.
"Noviye Izvestia" asked Shubenkov to share impressions of the leaving season.
Sergey, a season for you is not finished yet?
Yes, I am going to compete at the World war games which will be played October in Korea, and then I will already think of rest.
However, to prepare now I am at home, in Barnaul, and to be at home - all this absolutely other state.
It is easier and easier, than to be wound every week on the world.
You somehow told that fall - favourite season for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September - fine time.
Passions after the main start of a season ceased to boil, responsibility freight does not press any more.
It is possible to compete in pleasure, on "relaxation".
You know plus, as a holiday very soon...
And the fatigue is?
After all season special, mass of positive emotions...
The fatigue by the end of a season always collects.
And here it is not important that did more - won or lost.
Each competition is a stress.
Continuous flights, moving - all this does not pass for an organism completely.
You are tired physically and emotionally.
But now emotions at me, of course, on rise.
In any case - I am simply happy!
By the time of when finished in the World Cup in Beijing, you come back often?
Happens.
And you, journalists, do not allow me to forget about it.
But in general I consider that that athlete who lives old victories is bad, scrolls the successful runnings again and again.
Enjoyed a victory two-three of days - and it is necessary to move further.
Preparation for this remarkable season strongly differed from habitual?
I cannot tell that there was something like that special.
We began to prepare in December, but I passed a winter competitive season.
Trained at first at home in Barnaul, then on collecting, then again at home.
In total as usual.
But with the trainer set the task: to try to come to the new level at which I was not yet.
Practically all winter time was spent on putting base.
Ran a heap of cross-countries, did exercises on overall physical conditioning which included both draft, and a squat, and we pumped over a back.
Then were accepted to barrier preparation, were engaged in the equipment much.
How rivals act, watched?
I always try to do it, the benefit during an era of the Internet with it is not present any problems.
Looked at the winter European championship, and there in barrier sprint all pedestal was occupied by French!
Thought still: it is necessary to do something, to dilute this company.
With each start in this season you added and added in results.
It gave to confidence?
At me all last seasons develop according to approximately identical scheme.
It that I run at first 13,20, and then - 13,50 is absent.
Always I untwist the form gradually.
The main thing that wanted to be made, - to run out from 13 seconds.
All work was directed first of all to this result.
But the paradox is that it seems you feel that it is ready for feats, and at competitions to show the readiness it turns out not always.
How it was, for example, at the Olympic Games in London?
I am, frankly speaking, that semifinal running (Shubenkov could not be selected in the final.-) tried to forget at once.
It was ready very well, really could run out from 13 seconds.
Yes even if would repeat the best result at that time, would become the bronze prize-winner of Games.
But it was not lucky.
You remember the first World Cup?
And how?
In Daegu it was.
I very much then wanted to get into the final, there was such maximum programme.
Also fell off directly with it will be wiped, in preliminary runnings.
Then understood that to tear and rush like mad - means in general not to come running anywhere.
In two years in the World Cup in Moscow already reached the final with the best time.
Well I remember the feelings before a decisive running: there was a strong wish to win "gold" already then!
How it is possible, gathering decent speed, not to lose also the head, not to be disconnected?
And this is also the most difficult.
It is necessary to be very accurate, concentrated on the equipment not to bring down barriers.
Noticed that when you are adjusted not on result, and on process, so much easier.
And the high when you have a feeling that you run also all as if by itself turns out!
The word of honor, it is worth it.
Our many athletes from the remote place after the first serious progress seek to move closer to the capital.
Never there were such thoughts?
It is all the same best of all than the house.
And I do not represent where I without the trainer to whom I am necessary?
Perhaps it would also be good to have conditions better, but I try to be happy with what I have.
C Klevtsov you long ago together?
Since 12 years since came to track and field athletics.
More precisely, at first I trained at his wife who worked with children, and then already she transferred me.
I began with sprint, then in length jumped, threefold.
The children's all-round was - it is when metat a ball, jump in length from the place...
In 14 tried run with barriers, and it was pleasant to me.
From the first running it turned out to execute the standard of the second adult category.
And remained.
The fear of barriers never was?
Somehow at once it turned out to agree with them.
But it was always necessary to work on the equipment much.
Over one dispersal how many suffered!
But from this routine not to get to anywhere.
The equipment should be perfected constantly - that at night I could be woken, I got up at once and would run through barriers.
All who saw your running in Beijing, claim that it was very beautiful run.
Thanks.
And most it was pleasant to me.
Usually I do not reconsider the runnings, and here could not keep.
But it is necessary to work on efficiency further - there are no limits to perfection.
You are not afraid now that the victory one year prior to the Olympic Games will lie heavily upon shoulders?
As speak in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
Time chose this road, means has to go all the way.
My trainer likes to repeat: if you are not a weakling, should not feel any additional freight.
And I absolutely in it agree with it.
Kushanashvilli's flocks
Well not so I am naive that I was surprised by reaction to the interview which happened in Ukraine.
People are angered, I understand, do not feed with their bread - give, throw the enemy.
And though I was not wound with a flag, and the same, exactly the same, one million times spoke here, and directly called nobody the bastard, - another touched me.
All my pseudo-friends in a moment, in a second evaporated somewhere.
Pressure to which I am exposed, so strong that even I, the worldly-wise fellow, think that people of a henbane ate too much.
As if went to itself, went, and you were attacked by crowd and well to beat rods.
But it is necessary to know me, I am not a room eagle, me a fist, I from a howitzer will hit, I am old, children to be afraid.
Another matter - any support.
I and so had no illusions, and now...
Self-sufficiency so take a bite was the best in me always.
And to give passports to such freaks as Fred Derst or Monson, only morons can.
Better to me, the best journalist, work not shameful.
A week ago in Kiev of Flocks of Kushanashvili in a sharp form characterized the Crimean events:
What was made with the Crimean peninsula - a crime.
It is also called annexation.
I so believe that the reference to how tipsy Khrushchev tried to sign something in any time does not fit into an overall picture of human community.
It how to come to the neighbor and to take away his living space...
War from the Kremlin went, and it will end only there.
I practically for 100% am sure that, as well as in the summer of the 2008th, it began with a call of some bastard from the Kremlin torture chamber.
I have assumptions who it could be...
Kobzon not so needed to live much.
I do not understand, he is the most great actor why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
It what, will lose the apartment?
Well, demolished to it a monument.
Of course, people remembered it as offending the small homeland.
And reconciliation depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich now.
Sunrise of the Seventh is in the lead in rating despite attempts of the Ninth to light loss of leaders in Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's sortie to Canberra for illumination of consequences of the statement of the Liberal Party for release of the place of the leader could not lift the rating of Today strongly.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the state capital after defeat by Malkolm Turnbull of Tony Abbott.
The competitor - Sunrise - with leaders David Koch and Samantha Armytage, got stuck in London within a week series of the international broadcasting which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture in distance, it seems, was not of great importance for the Australian TV viewers while the audience of Sunrise totaled 397 000 viewers in five biggest cities in comparison with audience of Today in 339 000.
Today gathered a little more in comparison with the rating on Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), however its figure was worse, than last Thursday (343 000).
Today reduced a gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August Today had 318 000 in comparison with 330 000 at Sunrise.
At the beginning of a year the gap fluctuated between 40 000 and 50 000.
So far in September Sunrise has 349 000 viewers against 314 000 at Today.
This the most interesting that there was all morning.
Winds of change influence more, than Parliament this morning, children!
Karl and Liza as it should be, thanks for specification!
TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015 is published.
The tremendous debut of 800 Words with the former star of series Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson was important news to the Seventh.
The new drama about recently become a widow/widower father of family who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with the two children collected impressive audience in 1,219 million viewers.
Critics argued whether Thomson can cope with a popular show alone, without star of Rafters of Rebecca Gibney.
Result of yesterday evening - the loud answer "yes".
The X Factor of the Seventh remained on strong positions with audience of 1,136 million audience, having easily bypassed The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
For the Seventh good luck and failure in the second evening of Chase Australia mixed up.
The first half an hour (from 17:00 till 17:30) a new television quiz show which was conducted by Andrew O'Kifi brought together 446 000 viewers.
The second half an hour (from 17:30 till 18:00) the figure jumped up to 623 000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat of Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday evening the first half an hour of Chase Australia brought together 520 000 viewers, and the second half an hour - overwhelming 720 000.
Hot Seat brought together 620 000.
The Ninth will force to recognize falling of ratings of Chase Australia for the second evening quietly that Hot Seat will dominate after all at 5:30.
Chase Australia - replacement of Million Dollar Minute which could not change McGuire's show.
It was initially published as "Sunrise is in the lead whereas Today remains at the local level"
Three finalists are unanimous that "Bachelor" Sam Wood is the ideal guy, but who will be chosen by him?

Diabetics with small obesity can be helped by obesity surgery
The favorable effect after obesity surgery at the people with small obesity having diabetes 2 types can last not less than five years, according to a new research.
However now for the present early to claim that diabetics with small obesity live longer after obesity surgery, than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The statistics of mortality is shown absolutely not at once", - doctor Robin Blackstone, the expert in obesity surgery who wrote about a new research in a column of the editor of JAMA Surgery declared.
The obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods for reduction of the size of a stomach.
They reduce feeling of hunger and limit ability to organiza to acquire food.
For several years the bariatric surgery proved the efficiency for treatment of diabetes 2 types, but the main researches were conducted among the people with morbid obesity having the body weight index (BWI) 35 or above.
BMI, weight concerning growth, is considered normal at value from 18,5 to 24,9.
BMI 25 or says above that the person has an excess weight, and people with BMI higher than 30 reckon as people with obesity.
You can calculate the BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new research researchers from the Taiwan hospital Min-Sheng General used the data collected since 2007 for comparison of two types of bariatric surgery - shunting of a stomach and sleeve gastrectomy, with medical treatment of diabetes 2 types at people with small obesity.
The BMI average value at those who underwent surgical intervention fell with 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in a research.
At the same time BMI at those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains approximately at the level of 29.
Among those who underwent an operation completely recovered from diabetes of 36%, and partially - 28%.
In the group receiving drug treatment for comparison, full treatment from diabetes was observed only at 1%, and partial - only approximately at 2%.
Besides, indicators of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL of cholesterol "in general were better in surgical group", - authors declare.
Researchers also controlled A1s hemoglobin levels in blood which reflect sugar levels in blood in dynamics.
A1c hemoglobin is better to hold lower than 7%, - researchers write.
After surgical intervention the average level of A1c hemoglobin decreased approximately from 9% to about 6%.
In therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, approximately at the level of 8%.
But the best indicators of glycemic control reflected by good levels of A1c hemoglobin did not reduce death rate in five years, according to the head of researches Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research group also compared average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, in comparison with group, polchivshy sleeve gastrectomy, the group of shunting lost more than the weight (18,7 kg against 14,2 kg), achieved bigger decrease in BMI (on 7,4 against 5,1) and A1s hemoglobin (3,1% against 2,1%), and also was closer to full remission of diabetes (46,9% against 16,7%).
Though the new research does not show advantages of a surgical method regarding life expectancy after five years, there are confirmations by results of a research of people with excess body weight in Sweden that surgical treatment really leads to increase in life expectancy as Blackstone from College of medicine to Phoenix reports, the University of Arizona.
According to the Swedish research for the people with obesity who chose bariatric intervention, probability to die for 15 years was about 29% lower in comparison with group in which more traditional methods were applied.
In spite of the fact that the new research did not show increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with BMI lower than 35, interested in such procedure.
"Here the report is very important as it in it is claimed that such surgical intervention is safe in group with low BMI where there is no increased risk of mortality or renal diseases", - she declared.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors have to begin to treat the weight as soon as BMI of the patient gets to range between from 27 to 30 seriously.
"I consider, we too long wait to force people to treat it seriously", - she told.
It seems to me that as soon as they save up genetic changes which start obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is back very difficult to turn it.
In Mytishchi robbers took out from the house of a fur coat and 9 million rubles.
In Mytishchi robbers attacked inhabitants of the house situated near Moscow and stole from them 9 million rubles and three women's fur coats.
Informs Interfax with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation on it.
Incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown through an open entrance door entered the house located on Gorky Street connected the 20-year-old son of the hostess of the house and, threatening with both knife, stole 9 million rubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage made 9 million 265 thousand rubles, criminal case under the article "Robbery" is brought.
Fans from Europe risk to become the homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to place with themselves tourists who in 2018 will come to look at the FIFA World Cup.
Other hotels do not hurry to get the corresponding permission yet.
According to experts, it is very alarming sign.
In the run-up to the world championship the authorities urgently should think out how to settle all city visitors.
Interlocutors of Rosbalt consider that because of a tournament cost rent of rental apartments will grow by 10-30%, and and after the championship it is necessary to overpay for rental housing.
The FIFA World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to a condition of the Russian hotels.
Under the law written specially under superiority, each hotel of St. Petersburg has to undergo the procedure of classification and prove that it corresponds to the declared quantity of stars and level of service.
Already now it is clear that it will be possible to make not everything: hoteliers so are afraid of checks that they often do not even send documents for inquiries of Federal Antimonopoly Service across St. Petersburg.
As the head of OFAS Vadim Vladimirov told, department studied 138 hotels and now plans to open 34 cases concerning hotels, many of which just did not answer anti-monopolists.
There are signs that the management of three tens companies deceived citizens, placing this or that quantity of stars in advertizing, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now on the account literally each number, any it is impossible to lose before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city tourists can count on 30,5 thousand numbers.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 - two - and three-star, 550 - one-star.
According to the first deputy of committee on development of tourism Nanna Gvichiya, at the moment classification there underwent only 23 hotels - so many inspections were carried out by the companies accredited in St. Petersburg.
And whether some hotel here ordered the similar procedure from the regional enterprises, Smolny on surprising combination of circumstances does not know.
That is undergone classification maybe it is more, but nobody knows about it.
"The last half a year hotels not really sought to undergo classification", - the director of Northwest office of the Russian Union of Travel Industry Ekaterina Shadskaya recognized.
It is explained by a high season during which hoteliers earn most of all money and do not want to be engaged in another matters.
One more reason - budgets in which expenses on checks were not put at the same time the procedure can cost hotel depending on the status from 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
But nevertheless recently heads of hotels became more active and began to submit applications for classification, Shadskaya assured.
Hotels should be in time till July 1, 2016, otherwise they not only will pay a penalty, but also will not acquire the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that depending on stardom the fixed payment for the room in hotel for the period of holding a tournament will be developed.
Formulas on which the cost will be calculated will publish next year.
It is made not to allow a price hike for 200-300% as it occurs, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
It is necessary to have conscience and not to allow increase by two-three times, but also hotels need to allow to earn.
"I think, growth will be to 50%", - the president of the Russian hotel association Gennady Lamshin explained.
In turn Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that fixing of the prices corresponds to understanding of market economy.
I do not know as far as it keeps within a framework of the economic theory, but I hope that this measure justified.
"It is better than an impetuous rise in price", - he noted.
It is not clear what will be with popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the State Duma introduced the bill according to which hostels have to be forbidden in houses.
Very much we hope that this law will not be adopted or will not concern St. Petersburg.
"We will argue the point of view that hostels have to be kept", - Nana Gvachiya considers.
However, according to her, owners of mini-hotels have to be anyway ready to toughening of the Housing code.
If the State Duma after all approves the bill, then in St. Petersburg about 80% of hostels will be closed, and at the moment in them there are 1,5 thousand numbers.
According to the president of Federation of restaurateurs and hoteliers of the Northwest Leonid Garbar, in St. Petersburg there are not enough two - and three-star hotels which just and are demanded by football fans, but there is a distortion towards hotels with four and five stars.
Such situation is similar to a situation when "at 80-thousand stadium 75 thousand VIP sit".
It can be corrected just at the expense of mini-hotels.
The expert considers their possible ban "idiocy": "It seems to me strange that one people can live in apartments, and here visitors for some reason cannot."
If the hostel is used as the hostel, then I agree that it is wrong.
But if as hotel to which guests come for short term, then why and is not present?
Mini-hotels risk to miss the FIFA World Cup and because of the sluggishness.
The whole hundreds of small hotels just will not manage to undergo classification, and dig a hole to themselves.
To summer of 2016 works will book all hotel room of the city.
"The companies which can carry out this procedure not so much therefore they will refuse less paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those which are more expensive", - Gennady Lamshin noticed, having added that in a number of the cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, indicators of the undergone checks at the moment are much higher than St. Petersburg.
The reason of the St. Petersburg delay is connected including with constant shifts in the tourist block of the government that does not promote harmonious work.
According to experts if all lack the St. Petersburg hotels that most likely it is necessary to pay attention to regional hotels and rest houses.
By an example of celebration of the 300 anniversary of St. Petersburg to the city can mobilize the river fleet, that is guests of a tournament will be able to live in cabins.
Besides many fans it is prepared will come by vans in which it will be possible to spend the night.
"The main thing not to adjust so many hotels that then they were empty", - Gennady Lamshin is sure.
During football superiority removable housing will enjoy also wide popularity.
Most likely in the city will create a reserve of rental apartments.
Rates on rent will grow by 10-30%.
"Obvious - the first will be left by housing near stadium", - the specialist in rent of the Agency of development and researches in the real estate Larisa Bragina noted.
And the price of rent can not return on the previous level after the championship, especially in dormitory areas.
It will be promoted also by construction of new traffic intersections on suburbs of the city, she emphasized.
You should not forget also about human qualities of citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg was always the hospitable city in which people not just prompt the road, but can hold a mini-excursion.
There are also complications.
My father in the 1970th in the yard met to year a family from Murmansk - the father, mother and two children.
It was it there is no place to spend the night: with hotels then it was difficult, at the station it is heavy to sleep.
"And the father brought them into our communal flat to sleep", - the interlocutor remembered.
However, added that now such line in residents it was not necessary - to call to himself home it is fraught with consequences and it is terrible.
But maybe, in 2018 after unsuccessful decisions of the State Duma, mistakes of hoteliers and the governments it is necessary to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "merged" the Amur region.
With admiration looked at Zhirinovsky's clownery in the State Duma today.
It did such things when our generation just learned to trade in newspapers, and still is in peak form.
Performance subject, it seems, - "a protest of LDPR against results of elections in the Amur region".
Protocols does not shake - because there is nothing; except signed by electoral commissions, the LDPR, apparently, has no other protocols.
Here it lifts Ivan Abramov who took the second place and something shouts it seems: "Here - the winner of elections!"
And right there snatches from anything on Rodnina, and then, after the skirmish already with the chairman, takes away fraction from the conference hall, crying out literally "All of you with your fronts swindlers and thieves".
The press, naturally, gives accent not on Abramov, and on scandal and a demarche of fraction as a result of this scandal and an insult.
Really Volfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole country it is the next trick of Zhirinovsky in style "Geeks!", and not a protest of political party against results of concrete elections at all.
And the fraction formally rowed, and elections if to trust the website of party and Ivan Abramov's Facebook, are not recognized, but the leader from a subject obviously gets down.
Provides to the dead on Amur to bury the dead persons, and itself preaches against United Russia in general and innocent Rodnina.
The graceful decision that also not to lose face, and not to go to the real, but not ostentatious scandal.
Another thing is that now Abramov also falls into a strange state.
Except cries from the administration he waited for nothing, there are no protocols alternative on hands.
It - out of focus public attention, on the one hand, and with another - for a narrow circle it became a formal reason and for an insult of dear champion, and that even more abruptly, boorish attacks to ER and ONF.
And here he, of course, should think seriously very much what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of elections, the politician number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 for the only regional single-candidate district he can turn into the pariah which own party management and a super-irritant for that ONF and the party guide of the stranger successfully used.
Here precisely - there would be no Zhirinovsky, he should be thought up and respectfully to watch him.
To Trump to him still grow and raise.
There was news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the following plenary meeting.
That is the bath fell in general from anything.
Only, Abramov's subject under itself buried.
Beautifully really.
"It is impossible that all arrived to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, Dalai Lama declared, having added that the real solution of the current crisis of refugees lies on the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists urged to stop violence in the countries which are the homeland of refugees.
Dalai Lama concerned a question of the continuing crisis of refugees in the speech at opening of the Center of compassion of Dalai Lama in Oxford devoted to ethics researches at the beginning of the 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He declared that in the existing circumstances interests of mankind have to be above interests of the certain countries or even continents.
He also emphasized that though it and causes admiration, reaction of the Western European countries to crisis of refugees is not adequate to a situation.
"It neozmozhno that all arrived to Europe", - he noted in the speech.
Though Dalai Lama highly spoke of the actions undertaken by Germany and Austria in connection with crisis, he emphasized that it is only temporary solution.
"Care of thousands of refugees - it is fine, but at the same time you have to think also of long-term decisions how to bring the real world and the real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries", - he emphasized.
Eventually, we have to think of how to reduce number of murders in their countries.
We have to weaken use of force.
Use of force never solved these problems", - he added.
Speaking about violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after acts of terrorism 9/11, having declared that rigid reaction of the USA started a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed condolences in the letter to the president Bush and told it that the solution of this problem is possible through a non-violence.
I know that its intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences", - Dalai Lama told.
Fourfold increase in number of the children who swallowed hand sanitizer for the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States reported about almost 400 percent increase, since 2010, the number of children are younger than 12 years which swallowed hand sanitizer with the high content of alcohol as reports poison control center of the State of Georgia.
According to doctor Gaylord Lopez, the director of poison control center of the State of Georgia, cases of ingestion by children up to 12 years of hand sanitizers about which it was reported in poison control centers increased with 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children contact to these substances more often, and, unfortunately, their some percent goes to emergency department", - Lopez told CNN.
He told that some children drink sanitizer specially, and some do it to make an impression on the friends, or on a bet for social networks.
On videos on Youtube it is visible how teenagers drink sanitizer as cheap binge.
As it is reported, teenagers mixed sanitizer with alcohol-containing mouthwash to receive stronger drink.
Pleasant smells of sanitizer can attract children of younger age.
"The child does not think that it can do much harm to him", - Lopez reported.
Many of the most attracting (hand sanitizers) - those which are flavored.
There are hand sanitizers with a smell of strawberry, grapes, orange which are very attractive to children.
Hand sanitizer contains from about 45 to 95 percent of alcohol.
In particular, only several squirts can cause alcohol poisoning in small children.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol", - Fox 4 in Kansas City Dr. Stephen Thornton, the chief physician of poison control center in hospital of the Kansas university told.
You would not leave just like that a shot glass with whisky, but people hold these hand sanitizers on a look and if children reach them, it is a fast way to take a large amount of alcohol.
Naidzha Russell, the six-year-old girl who at school swallowed recently hand sanitizer with strawberry aroma in number of about four squirts, was sent for treatment in emergency department.
It had a blood alcohol level 179, is twice more, than at the adult who under the law is considered being drunk, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey - the emergency doctor who treated her in the medical center Gwinnett near Atlanta.
The Naidzha confused words and could not go when it was brought to emergency department.
Doctors observed it all night long in separate children's clinic to do not pass any symptoms of a brain trauma as because of alcohol the girl fell and hit the head, Ritchey told.
"It was very terrible", Ortoriya Scott, Naidzhi's mother told CNN.
It quite could be deadly to my child.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers to use nonalcoholic products or sanitizing wipes, besides, chtba to remove hand sanitizers from a zone of reach of children.
Besides alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers connect with death.
In 2013 two women from Ontario died after swallowed the disinfectant containing the toxic not declared ingredient.
Officials of health care suspect that the product contained methanol - the deadly agent, but not ethyl alcohol which was specified as active ingredient.
In January three pupils fourth-graders in the north of New York agreed to poison their "nasty" teacher with way of "distribution of antibacterial substances in a class", according to the report of police.
The teacher has a severe allergy to hand sanitizers, and she forbade to keep them in the class.
The police considers that the failed plan was "insignificant talks", and addresses questions of discipline to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became family club.
On a bench back at an entrance to regional children's library of N.K. Krupskaya the pig-iron owl longs.
Kids who come for books try to feed her with candies.
Already several generations go to this library within 95 years.
The very first readers in the twenties arranged of the last century loud readings here, put performances on Mayakovsky's verses, held literary quizes and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
Correspondence continued four years, and as the Yuny Stalinets newspaper wrote in 1939, every day "friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of children's library of the city of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent to distant Barnaul friends the children's photo once.
And when Barnaul citizens asked whether Nadezhda Konstantinovna that appropriated to library her name objects, wrote that they are not present, does not object.
Letters become dusty in the museum long ago, and grandsons and great-grandsons of the first readers should explain whose the severe profile decorates a bas-relief on the library building.
During the perestroika years often different people called, were indignant: why the children's library is not renamed?
Let there will be a library of a name of some good children's writer, without political overtones!
Library workers sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as is.
Krupskaya is, perhaps, the most known and favourite library in Barnaul as "leninka" in Moscow.
On a floor in a library lobby - a path from a yellow brick.
"The wizard of the emerald city" - a favourite subject of the artist Olya Moskovka.
Earlier Olya was a manager in law firm, came to work to eight, went to five, and differed from all other managers only in love to drawing.
And then found the announcement in the Internet: "The illustrator for the book is required".
The book was written by the little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mother has cancer".
Olya did illustrations, and thought: life can end at any time, and no miracles in it will exist if you do not create them.
Now she works in library, illustrates children's books of writers of the whole world and itself writes fairy tales.
Traditionally it is considered that children lose interest in the book that all of them live in some virtual space more...
But to us the reading children go, and their parents understand value of reading, - the director of library Tatyana Kushvid tells "The Russian planet".
In recent years we even had such moment of confidence that the children's library is necessary, and it will live - children go here!
It seems to me, interest in reading comes back.
In a lobby of library the big exhibition stained-glass window with the updated photo exhibit hangs.
Quarterly new photos of readers which go to library all family are hung out: mother, father and children.
The library rejoices that with children fathers even more often began to come.
If in two years read to the child all Chukovsky, then at more advanced age he needs books more difficult.
But now the law under which the eight-year-old child prodigy is forbidden to issue books from category 12+ works.
To receive such book, the child has to bring with himself parents - they come, then come back again, and gradually Krupskaya becomes for them something like family club.
In library there are treasures - the pre-revolutionary collection of bylinas with the old letters "yat" and hard signs, Korolenko's stories in the annex to the Niva magazine, bound file of "Murzilka" for 1936.
We now not only conceptual space "the temple of the book", we are open for the movement now, we try to become the special place: not the house, not work, not school, - Tatyana Kushvid explains.
To us it is possible to come together to esteem, play, draw.
We made a game zone for kids - the child comes just to play, and the hand all the same reaches for the book!
Parents carry away some of our readers, and they dig heels, do not want to leave.
Often mothers with carriages come - and it is pleasant to us that they put library on the first place among all other places where it is necessary to come with kids.
Tatyana Kushvid speaks: modern children as well as we once, love classical children's literature:
"Publishing develops now, and is paid much attention to authors who are a link between generations".
And if to speak about little children, then to them it is important that there was some hero who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to leave the heroes.
The library constantly publishes booklets for parents in whom tells what occurs in modern children's literature to what books it is worth paying attention and why.
Booklets so fascinating and intriguing, as adults become interested, but this library after all not for them.
It is forbidden to take out books out of borders of the reading room the adult.
Only children have this magic privilege.
... In the most distant room of library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden ladder to the cellar, in a book-depository.
Steps will squeak under your steps - it is already very old time machine.
The book of the childhood you meet, as the old companion: hi, it is good that we with you do not change.
Ellie still cheerfully walks on the road paved with a yellow brick, the idler Tolya Ryzhikov steals magic matches, and Malchish-Kibalchish did not tell damned bourgeoises of the Military Secret - it at it the firm word.
Such books - as passwords, in any place it is possible to recognize the by them.
Is in storage and the real book rarities - for example, the pre-revolutionary collection of bylinas with the old letters "yat" and hard signs.
Or Korolenko's stories in the well-known annex to the Niva magazine.
Or bound file of "Murzilka" for 1936.
Time made old pages, painted them in tea color.
These editions do not give out to readers any more.
These are splinters of our future collection, I all dream - I will retire and I will be engaged in rare children's books.
But children on it already, so to speak, will not be moved: and paints in old books not really bright, and subjects... you open the first page, and there - Lenin, party, Komsomol.
Now it seems: why all of us wrote out this "The pioneer truth?"
But it was all the same interesting, - Galina Ilyasova managing a book-depository tells "The Russian planet".
Pages of "Murzilka" darkened from time.
Galina Vasilevna manages a book-depository all the life.
She knows what color a cap at Buratino in what academic year Harry Potter became the captain of Gryffindor in the Quidditch championship in what situations Carlson uses the muffler for a motor and as whom Alisa Selezneva's father works.
Pay a little for work of the librarian, and all who can live without these book ranks, very quickly find to themselves other profession.
Remain only the most convinced: educators, teachers, attendants of a cult of the book.
They can be recognized also on a smile - it is considered that it is professional line of the children's librarian.
If he smiled to you the first minute of a conversation - it is the professional.
I in general love children's books: as it is pleasant to me to the librarian that they were that exactly and beautifully stood on shelves, and still I adore reading them, - Galina Vasilevna says.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fantasy.
I read modern Russian writers, the fresh translations...
Of course, it seems to me, in my childhood everything was another.
Books were the most interesting and fascinating of everything that then happened to me.
And as I madly loved them, it seemed to me that the library is a magic place.
And I wanted to work where all sit and read.
I hope that books will be always, despite readers.
Also I rejoice when our former readers bring children, and even grandsons...

Why I am the witness of an execution in Oklahoma
Today, evading from legal intervention at a late stage, I will watch how execute the person.
If it happens, and I hope that I nevertheless am not present, I will sit in the viewing gallery in the death chamber in prison of the State of Oklahoma when Richard Glossip is executed by means of a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and though I was thrown in shock, I agreed.
With approach of this day I began to be afraid.
So why it to do?
I agreed as I thought that it is a good way to tell a detailed story to the death penalty.
It would offer a unique foreshortening.
Yes, journalists are allowed to be present at executions at America, and as persons interested it is frequent more, than places, results of a gloomy lottery solve who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma the number of places for the press reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever was chosen, he will look at it without emotions.
I am not able to do it.
I will sit with the closest friends of Richard Glossip, and we with him had own relations after several months of phone calls and one visit lasting two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The administration of prison claims that I cannot be at the same time the witness and the journalist therefore will not allow to take me a notebook and the handle to write down what I see.
I should try to remember all details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me of Twitter that I renounce the impartiality.
It is a lesson.
Tell a story of the prisoner as it is pleasant to him, get access.
I complained to it.
She recognized that she "could and is better formulate", but still considers that I am wrong in what I do.
Richard Glossip did not agree with something from what I told and wrote.
He did not say to me what to write, and I would not begin to do it even if he would speak.
I told it that he can strike me off the list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants that the journalist of the international edition was present there to write about it.
If he dies, he considers that publicity will help the movement for abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, the reporter from The Huffington Post, will be together with me.
If you want to learn about this business more, listen to podcasts which I wrote down.
I will not begin to go here into details once again.
I cannot tell with confidence that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
Its actions after Barry van Treeze's murder do it guilty of complicity to a crime.
But I believe that there is a high probability of the fact that he is not guilty of murder.
I am firmly convinced that there were not enough proofs for the death sentence.
I consider that its execution is wrong.
And from this foreshortening I will watch how he will die.
I cannot declare that I will be entirely objective.
There will be also other reporters whom it is possible to address for it.
From me you learn what it - to watch how the person who is pleasant to me dies needlessly.
The person pursued by police was persuaded to get out of the Canning River
The constable from the town of Canning Vale managed to persuade the person to get out of the Canning River, and most to remain dry.
The resident of Perth intended to leave from police, but did not manage, having got stuck in dirty water in shallow water in several meters from the police officer trying "to finish softly it to come to the coast".
The police of Canning Vale was called on Tuesday upon illegal penetration on others territory in Beckenham.
When police officers noticed the suspect, he tried to leave them, having rushed to the Canning River.
But far it did not departure.
"He stood in water and spoke "I will not leave, give, be enough me", - the staff sergeant Shandell Kasldayn told.
To the constable to Lachlan Perhavec not really wanted to wet a form therefore he used safer reception - "negotiations with the good police officer".
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to run away", - the staff sergeant Kasldayn says.
The champion footballer Ben Cousins was also remembered by it.
In 2006 Cousins moved down in a ditch to avoid a meeting with police patrol for check on alcohol, and Swan tried to cross.
Its efforts were vain, but moved locals to invent comic "Ben Cousins's biathlon".
Peter Moody accuses stewards of attempt of espionage and threatens to leave equestrian sport
Peter Moody accused stewards of Racing Victoria of attempt to introduce the spy in his stable last year and threatened that he will immediately leave equestrian sport.
Stewards and staff of department of ethics of Racing Victoria whom he accused that they organized a campaign personally against it, and removal from start of Lady Tatai because of violation of the rules of use of medicines in day of start, on Wednesday became its target, became the last straw.
Moody reported to Fairfax Media that it always uses the best efforts, participating in jumps, and it appeared in a difficult situation when it came about positive result of test of Lidari on cobalt what he cannot explain.
He kept the mouth shut concerning suspicions of espionage for one and a half years and did not want that it "looked as grapes are green".
"I was not going to tell anything about it, and suffered long time, but sometimes it so unsettles you that you do not restrain any more", - Moody declared.
They know that it proceeded.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to endure consequences, and I should live with what I told.
Today I will go home and I will sleep tight.
I want to go with highly raised head and I want that my owners knew - I do everything possible for them.
When they begin to think that it not so, then I will need to stop being the trainer.
Then I should think what to do with the license.
Earlier Moody sensationally declared during the interview on racing.com that the department of ethics tried to spy in its stable.
"One and a half years ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and doctor Brian Stewart sat down in the room with the person whom I will call if ask, and offered him work in my stable to transfer information on what I do at myself in a stable", - Moody on Racing.com declared.
They obviously consider that I am a swindler.
If this is so, all of them, undoubtedly, have to submit applications as they was not successful attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, the former chairman of RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the naneshny executive director of RVL, knew about it all the time and know now.
Does it have to force me to think that business becomes personal?
Whether have to take courage in RVL and call to account for what occurs in this business, other people, besides trainers?
Whether I am bad for this profession?
Whether so I am bad for this profession?
Perhaps, people think there that it indeed.
Perhaps, they should take away from me the license and to push out me away, and I do not doubt - what I tell now, can force them to think of it.
But I was now at that end of the resources where to me all the same, and it grieves me.
To me from it it is really sad.
I will put pressure upon them and I will confer on them responsibility for decision-making.
I have a support from a family, and I can leave.
The disappointment of the trainer only grew in the course of long investigation of a case with cobalt and Lidari, and the last removal of a horse from start forced it to declare that it can "throw the license for a table".
Moody most of all famous for that Black Kaviar prepared the invincible champion, called requirements to use of medical supplies in day of competitions "ridiculous" after the compress from clay was applied on legs of a horse that is violation of the rules.
This violation of the rules on jumps.
"I have to bear full responsibility for it, - he declared.
One of my workers by mistake made by it a compress on a leg.
She could receive a compress last night.
She could receive it yesterday as it and was.
It was with it in day of a running.
Moody can be disqualified for three months according to rules about use of medical supplies in day of competitions for use of a compress concerning what stewards opened investigation.
It is a joke.
The people creating these rules know nothing about horses.
"All of us understand that we need rules, but it went too far", - Moody told.

The motorcyclist was brought by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious wounds after he was hit by the car on the Murray Valley Highway in the morning on Saturday.

The trainer "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellamy parries charges of rivals in application of rigid body-checks
The trainer "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellamy called criticism of tackling it team as "imposing of the agenda" from two favourites of the NRL championship.
The coach of Sydney Roosters Trent Robinson declared that judges allowed Storm "to fight" with his team during the sudden victory of Storm in the final of a qualifying game in Sydney on Friday evening.
The coach of Brisbane Broncos Wayne Bennet made an obvious hint on Storm after his team won the final of a qualification tournament against "North Queensland Cowboys" in the evening on Saturday when he called this game "typical" for league of rugby and declared that two of team of Queensland "were not too successful" in a hand-to-hand fight.
Bellamy was protected by tackling by the team and declared that they were just concentrated on "contact", intercepting a ball.
Added Bellamy that in it the criticism of his team from two leading trainers as it means that they are disturbed by possible defeat from Storm instilled confidence.
"It continues to emerge - I did not hear that Trent Robinson spoke about rigid receptions when they beat us with the score 24:2", - declared to Bellamy on Wednesday.
It can be charged that we changed nothing the whole year in the systems or technicians of protection, just for the last six weeks we paid special attention to contacts when tackling, and it became a turning point for us.
Trent there and he obviously trains three years excellent team so he probably did not get used to lose, and for it it became some shock.
It is amusing how it is always shown at this time.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea about "impressive soccer", having reminded the teacher that "Sent-George-Illavarra Dregons" of Bennett won in the championship in 2010, showing "boring" soccer.
Wayne speaks about fascinating soccer.
He decided to compare the game on Saturday evening to ours on Friday evening and to look how impressive was their game", - noticed Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized much, calling boring team, and Wayne declared that his it does not worry at all.
But now it has a team which can show that he considers by impressive soccer, especially the young midfielders with their speed.
It is soccer which you would like to play when you have such players.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants that all played soccer in its style - not each team has two such midfielders as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt that they could play so.
It gives me more confidence because they tell these things as they are a little disturbed by a game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably did not think of us when they reached big games.
Also marked out Bellamy that a game of Storm and "Rusters" was a competition with a large number of points, than the game "Bronkos" and "Kauboyz".
The game "Bronkos" was probably good, I did not see yet it, but what was the account? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, it and is impressive soccer?
Or to consider impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts?
For me it is a routine.
If they mention us, it means that at some stage we can meet them there.
Storm at the end of this week has a day off as they won the right to receive or "Nort Queensland of Cowboys", or "Kronalla Sharks" next Saturday in the evening on the preliminary final at AAMI Park stadium, tickets will go on sale next Tuesday in the morning.

To Maksimovich allowed to be released on bail provided that he will hand over both Australian, and the Serbian passport, will be noted in police daily and to observe a curfew from 6 o'clock in the evening to 6 o'clock in the morning.

Now it will be necessary to resist more big center the rival, but I was already engaged in it earlier so I think, and now I will cope.
Soldiers won Euroleague in 2008 last time.

I and before games have no certain rituals, I just listen to music and I try to relax as far as it is possible.

The captain of Arsenal Mikel Arteta says that his teammates have to support the injured Jack Wilshere before a game with "Dynamo Zagreb"
In a conversation with Wilshere Wenger also emphasized that else September and that under a condition if Wilshere's recovery goes according to the plan, then to it nothing will prevent to return to a game by Christmas.
At the most favorable succession of events Wilshere will precisely miss at least four next games in England and, considering the incident, its participation in the European championship remains undecided next summer.
Annoying in this recent problem the fact that Wilshere surely finished the previous season with the only injury of an anklebone and was going to return to habitual aggressive style of a game during early preparation.
Wenger: "This trauma does not threaten his career".
It is just not up to the end healed bone.
Anything serious.
It is just accident.
It is not connected with anklebones or with injuries which at it happened earlier.
It can be the connected things from the medical point of view, but as Wenger also allowed, there is a risk of additional injuries interfaced to it for any player who is coming back to a game in the middle of a season.
Exists as well an adverse trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, at Wilshere 23 various injuries which happened to it in six years which passed from his debut are recorded.
Besides, he played only in 65 of 157 games of Arsenal in league for the last five seasons.
If to look at a deal for Arsenal more widely, it is possible to notice that in six of eight seasons, since 2007-08, Arsenal was one of two clubs of the Premier league, on which account the days which are most of all missed because of injuries.
Wenger recognizes probability of jamming in a vicious circle, but in Arsenal believe that improvement of statistics on injuries in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, having returned to a system after a trauma, you during some time are vulnerable - during this time you need to restore forces and to gain competitive advantage", Wenger told.
Jack is rather young and will cope.
I hope that it will be restored physically, I am confident in it, as well as that his career will be such which he deserves.
The arsenal begins a campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday with a match with "Dynamo Zagreb" and will continue it on Saturday by games with Chelsea and next Wednesday - about Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to carry out rotation of structure.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not arrive to Croatia therefore most likely in starting lineup Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will play.
Perhaps, Wenger will also enter into Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud's structure instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep balance and to grant a small respite to those players who need it", Wenger told.
Though Arsenal the unconditional favourite in group F, Maximir stadium in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
"Dynamo" did not lose any of 41 matches since at them it turned out to spend last season as "Invincible".
On Tuesday evening the stadium was affected by an earthquake measuring 3,2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is sure that the Arsenal learned the lesson received in last season when the team got beaten in a game of the Champions League by Monaco and it is necessary to lead with faint hope club to the victory in the cup-final of champions.
"It is the improbable drive", - Wenger noticed.
Arsenal never before did it.
We were very close to the purpose in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist with an experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show which taught us serious lessons of male friendship
Lack of similar stories is evident, especially if to consider how desperate became need of men for frankness, now more, than ever while the level of suicides among young men is on a maximum in 15 years.
In 2013 it became the only biggest cause of death of men aged between 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom, and happens to men three times more often than with women.
In attempt to understand a problem "The campaign against unfortunate life" announced 2015 Year of men with the purpose to throw down a challenge to culture which does not allow men to ask for the help when it is necessary to them.
Friendship is in the center of this fight to accept this call.
Recently conducted research more than 2 000 students of the universities showing depression symptoms revealed that if the patient has rather large number of friends "in normal mood", chances of treatment double.
Similarly for those who not in a depression, a circle of sincerely healthy friends twice reduce chance of developing of mental disorders.
But, of course, that friendship worked, first of all it is necessary that it was.
During an era when communications are operated by social networks when style is preferred to contents, speed of the answer is often appreciated more, than substantial contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving fun and successful even if the loneliness reigns in reality.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, the social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our internal aspiration to the personal growth and friendship that influences our sincere health stronger.
And, as recently one billionaire noticed, the creator of video games, for money generally you will not buy more happiness.
The advantage of Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each of characters was defined not by the work, but more likely by the personality who was shown in communication with friends.
Joey's humour and continuous embraces of Chandler, the moments of viewing of soccer on convenient chairs, Ross's lamentations according to Rachael - everything proceeds from understanding that men can feel it even if they often abstain from a full research of the feelings.
As the employee of "Samaritens" told me: "... my role of the listener for people who feel a depression and suicide moods, emphasizes how even the smallest communication of friends can bring benefit".
Often those men who address us feel not in forces to speak with friends.
Old lecture "live with it" it is strong, as well as feeling that straight talk about problems can be apprehended as weakness".
Friends one of those shows which occurs when I try to offer more for a long time working overcoming mechanisms.
It emphasized the hardly noticeable moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of the stranger talking by phone helps people at the despair moments, long-term support goes from a near circle of a family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central in these days off where for a holiday completely restored scenery why not to take the friends to drink in Central Perk.
Or, it is even better - if in Starbucks you see the lonely person, smile and tell "Hi".
In advance not to guess what benefit friendship can bring.
The series Friends are shown on Comedy Central since the beginning and up to the end, all 236 series, on a tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal, helping PSG to crush Malmö
Angel di Maria on an equal basis with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani celebrates the hammered balls in gate of Malmö.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal, than allowed PSG to bypass easily Malmö on Tuesday.
Here report on a match and reaction to a game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani made the business when Paris Saint-Germain began the game in the Champions League with extremely convenient victory 2:0 against Malmö at the Park stadium of de Prens on Tuesday.
Di Maria hammered a ball less, than in four minutes after its first game in the Champions League as the player of PSG began to set the direction to champions of France, but they missed a number of opportunities before, at last, increased the lead when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with "the Real Madrid" and Donetsk "Miner" in group A, "Bet" needed to be taken the good beginning in a game against champions of Sweden as they aimed not at qualification of the playoffs, and at continuation of a series of successful games of the last three seasons where they reached quarterfinals.
They scored points, but at the same time was not the best decision from Laurent Blanc to count Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in attack later to replace it in the field in a game against team from his hometown and club in which he started the brilliant career in 1999.
"It is difficult - to win houses or on a visit in the Champions League so to win a victory with the score 2:0, to deliver to rivals of problems and perfectly to play in protection is a good beginning even if and there are still moments which we will need to finish during the season", - Blanc told.
It it is promising.
We wanted to win, and we made it though I regret that we did not chuck in one or two balls more.
Ibrahimovic returned after a trauma in one of replacements as a part of the Parisian team that brought it a draw with the score 2:2 in a match with Bordeaux in the First league during week-end, but removed it on a background Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentina forward was marked out as the player capable to bring PSG to new level in Europe after it last month was redeemed at Manchester United, and he proved why when it ran out on a pass from Marco Verratti behind protection of Malmö he and beautifully finished the attack, having sent a ball by Johan Wiland to a far corner of gate.
However, if someone expected then from PSG of an easy and big victory, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö which won against Celtic the playoffs to reach this stage, having as a part of nine world players in the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two basic midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, except for blow of Nikola Djurdjic at which the ball flew by by a distant bar of gate of Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute they attacked very little.
But PSG from time to time brought itself not assists and the weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic who only in the first half could not realize not less than five attempts, and then could not process the ball hammered with Cavani right after renewal of a game.
Nevertheless, it proved to be much more skillful in exact passes, and it was the pass from Ibrahimovic, having received who, Di Maria sent a ball the twirled blow which passed very tightly to a bar by Wiland in the 52nd minute.
The second goal at last was scored after an hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan hammered the sixth ball in a season after after Ibrahimovic corrected the ball sent to a midfield from the left flank by Maxwell.
It put an end to any ideas which Malmö had concerning return to a game, and only tackling by Wiland at a short distance did not allow David Luiz to increase the final account before to Esecyel Lavezzi who came for replacement did not include a goal in the ending of a match.
The coach of Malmö Age Hareide recognized later that PSG were a class above his team, at the same time the Norwegian told: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December of last year".
Since then we played only in the Swedish league, and it is not that level.
Qualification is not enough.
Glory of "Bet"!
It was the wonderful match with them.

It is raised the question of deliveries of the Belarusian agricultural machinery and use of financial mechanisms - they are necessary to reduce the cost of cars for the end user.
Problems in work of the Tyumen trading house "Belshina" and options of prevention of losses were discussed.
Questions are important as investment projects have to work and make profit for the region accurately.
It was told about further deliveries of the cargo-and-passenger equipment of JSC MAZ, development of the service center JSC MAZ which is created in Tyumen on the basis of JSC TPATP.
The conversation concerned also preparation of a trip of working delegation of the region to Republic of Belarus until the end of the current year.
Completion of coordination and signing of the agreement on trade and economic, scientific and technical and cultural cooperation of the Tyumen region and Republic of Belarus became one more subject of a conversation.
Thus, dynamics of relationship promises to come to new level.
The matters concerned also the regional center.
During the meeting with the head of administration of the city of Tyumen Aleksandr Moor we spoke about updating of the Tyumen bus fleet.

One more aspect: The Tyumen lift plant cooperates with one of the leading producers of lift production of JSC Mogilevliftmash, receiving accessories.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, considering programs for installation of new elevators in the regional center.
I will add that within expanded powers of the consul the meeting with the governor of the Kurgan region Alexey Kokorin during which the question of increase in commodity turnover and delivery of the modern Belarusian equipment to the Trans-Ural region was discussed took place.

The expanded consular district includes five territorial subjects of the Russian Federation, but it is possible to call Tyumen a peculiar headquarters of the district.
The region is the ground for a running in of many perspective projects including works of the honorary consul general.
In general such meetings are significant and good the fact that they allow to solve directly and quickly many problems, removing their sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In present conditions it is extremely important not to destroy a reserve, continuing to work for prospect.

Vesti Economy ― Nobel laureate: globalization
To unpack Processes of globalization had to promote decrease in inequality in the world.
In practice the situation looks differently, the difference, on the contrary, grows in the income of the population in the developing economies.
Eric Maskin.
That to correct it, it is necessary to increase education level of low-skilled workers, the chief researcher of the International laboratory of the analysis and the choice of decisions of Higher School of Economics National Research University, the Nobel Prize laureate on economy considers 2007 Eric Maskin.
In the last twenty years the world endured the unknown growth of the global markets.
Trade borders between the countries became more and more open.
Supporters of globalization predicted big benefits for the developing economies.
"And these forecasts in many respects came true", - Maskin emphasizes.
So, for example, China and India received serious GDP growth per capita.
However not everything is so iridescent.
It was expected that globalization will reduce an abyss between "propertied" and "poor" in the poor countries which is shown in big inequality of incomes, to be exact - compensations.
But actually this inequality only increased, Eric Maskin in the article "Why the Global Markets Did Not Lower Inequality in the Developing Economies" published in The World Bank Economic Review which translated notes and quotes NIE HSE.
Together with the economist, professor of Harvard University Michael Cremer Eric Maskin developed the alternative theory which shows why the difference in the income in the poor countries in process of globalization growth increases, reminds NIE HSE.
In the new global market there are specific processes.
That to show them, Maskin marks out four skill levels of experts - A and B for the rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization experts of D of the poor countries lack skill level to cooperate with experts of A and B from the rich countries.
And if at workers of level C from the poor countries the salary grows thanks to cooperation with employees of B from the rich, then workers of the D growth do not feel or their salaries fall at all.
Total effect such is that internationalization of production will promote increase in a gap in compensation between two professional categories in the poor countries and according to increase in level of inequality.
Cremer and E. Maskin offered surprisingly beautiful model alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
She allows to explain why globalization led to inequality in the income, - Fuad Aleskerov, ordinary professor, the manager of the International laboratory of the analysis and the choice of decisions, the head of department of mathematics of Higher School of Economics National Research University says.
And as any powerful theory, I am sure, it will lead to surge in empirical works in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin, consists in increase in education level of low-skilled workers.
However workers as the scientist notes, have on it no means, and to the companies is unprofitable to pay their training.
The governments, the international agencies, NPO and private funds can play a significant role in such situation, Maskin considers.
The scientist notes that the developed theory does not call at all for a globalization process stop which bore and bears fruit in the form of GDP growth of the countries.

It represented the center of the American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as the venue of meetings with numerous American eminent persons among whom there were astronauts, actors, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Only last year the American center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and accepted more than 50 thousand Russian visitors", - the diplomat emphasized.
Tefft reminded that about a year ago the decision to close one more joint Russian-American project - the program of educational exchanges of FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program) was made.
The green Tribunal was fast on punishment.
Typical situation: four officials face a table of the judge Swatanter Kumar, listening to his claims to the done work.
The court is not satisfied with quality of your work at all.
We not for this purpose provided you the 110-page order that you laughed at it, - Kumar says. -
If at least one more brick is put, we will order to demolish all available constructions.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NGT) - the body of judicial authority founded in 2010 to stop the rapid environmental pollution accompanying the rapid economic growth of the last decades.
During this time the Tribunal managed to consider more than 10 thousand claims connected with air pollution, collecting garbage, geological developments, toxic waste and construction of dams.
In two of three cases the court makes the decision on the termination of the construction leading to pollution.
Rates are incredibly high: for incomplete 60 years, passed from the moment of declaration of independence of the strengthened industrial development India turned from the country of the virgin jungle into one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries of the world.
Especially the problem is particularly acute in large megalopolises where development of infrastructure does not keep up with a prompt urbanization: the cities are covered with a dense smog, the rivers are filled with pesticides and waste of the enterprises and households, and the few remained inhabited massifs are cut down under building by new residential quarters.
Despite formal support of the green movement from the state, the NGT is regularly exposed to criticism from Narendra Modi's government as often becomes the main reason of cancellation of the largest investment projects.
So, in May of this year the minister of the environment called the judgments "extreme" and "impracticable".
Sometimes the judgments cannot really be executed in the time put by court, the lawyer on ecological affairs Raj Panjwani confirms.
However impracticable deadlines have also a positive side: at least, they force responsible persons to move.
"Its main goal - to shake up this system", - the lawyer adds.
The green Tribunal already repeatedly cancelled major projects: on its account the termination of construction of the airport, power plant and hundreds of smaller constructions.
At the same time try not to forget about people too: for example, during discussion of destiny of the pharmaceutical company in Telagnan's staff polluting the local river fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are responsible also for economic consequences.
"People will lose work", - Kumar commented on the decision.
However similar explanations not always find understanding at simple people whose life can change thanks to one stroke of a judicial feather.
So, in April the Tribunal made the decision to forbid all vehicles 10 years entry into the capital are more senior, than caused public indignation.
Despite sharply fallen popularity and a barrage of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to cancel this decision.
Instead he ordered from the government of Delhi statistics about the driving and leaving motor transport, and also made the offer to buy 10 thousand additional buses, previously having learned at factories whether they are able to execute the similar order.
As such sources of pollution as dumps, quality of fuel began to get to the sphere of attention of court and even road incidents, people's wrath began to calm down gradually.
But the program for cleaning of the Ganges River with a pomp announced by the prime minister Narendra Modi last year became the most sore subject of the basic judge.
When it comes about Ganges - the river, sacred for Hindus, the judge often ceases to constrain the emotions and passes to shout.
You know what means the word "sacred"?
Someone poured out water of Ganges on God's statue, and in it there were excrements, - the judge gets excited. -
You continue to pollute the river because you think: Ganges is Ganges, it will take away all our sins.
It is the river which we worship, and look what you do with it every day.
Cleaning of Ganges is the most ambitious and expensive ecological project announced by the new government.
Now the quantity of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds norm more than by 120 times.
Annually from 1,5 to 3 of 700 million Hindus bathing in it die of infectious diseases.
In February Narendra Modi even offered in Fund of rescue of Ganges the money gained from sale of his suit in which it met Barack Obama and 455 more objects from his personal collection.
Ecologists right there accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for 700 thousand dollars while on cleaning of the river not less than eight billion are required.
Supporters of Green Tribunal agree that India should go still a long way before it is able to call itself the developed country, however at the same time do not consider that at the price of progress there has to be an ecology.
"In developing country a talk on the environment is often perceived as unattainable luxury, - the activist of the Call of Ganges organization Malika Bhanot says. -
And the court tries to find golden mean between ecology and development".
