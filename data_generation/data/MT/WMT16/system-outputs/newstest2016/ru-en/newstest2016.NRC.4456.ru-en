During a call to 911 teacher admits murder of girlfriend
During a call to 911 voice almost without flinching teacher Shannon Lamb told police that he shot his girlfriend and that need employees who would come to their home.
Lamb stressed that in the house there is a "dog" who is alive, but probably upset, and said that the contacts of the members of the families can be found in her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note, carelessly written by hand on a white piece of paper linovan: "I'm very sorry, I wanted everything to return back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to representatives of the authorities signed lamb.
There is nothing to indicate that the lamb, who led two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had to go 300 miles to the university campus, where police believe he shot all respectable history teacher Ethan Schmidt at the threshold of his cabinet.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university officials learned about the shooting at 10.18 am.
He said the truthful Lamb made the call to 911 shortly after that.
By the end of the day the victims will be one more: Lamb committed suicide as police surrounded him.
The next day after the shooting in an educational institution forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, officials were still trying to fold into one picture of the motives behind Lamba.
The information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and employees who knew him, helped create a portrait of a talented, but possibly concerned teachers.
Students were told they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gauthier, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not registered accusations of violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in his book, in which he expressed his gratitude to the "beautiful people" with whom he met in his teaching life.
They both taught at the faculty of social sciences and history, which includes 17 teachers, and many students attended the lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites of problems.
One student, who responded well to the Lambe, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed worried and nervous, "as if it was something wrong."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said Lamb at the end of the academic year SCPI told him about how he struggled with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to provide him leave for illness, saying that he had any health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university employment rules meant that the degree of doctor, on getting so hard lamb does not guarantee he would automatically get the position of a teacher.
University President William forge said that he knows nothing about the conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but "obviously, Mr. Lamba had something on his mind."
These are questions that lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police attacked Mark Lamba after his escape from the campus when he headed back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before the arrest, lamb shot from otdnozariadnyi 38 caliber pistol in the back yard of the house, one mile south of his parents' home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County coroner broom Johnson.
His car with the engine running still stood on the road.
It was unclear why the lamb Nesrazu came to this House, though, according to Johnson, she believes that he knew the people living in it.
Lamb grew up in those areas.
Lamb started to work at the university, which will consist of 3500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received a doctorate in Pedagogical Science in the spring of that year.
One of longtime friends Lamba described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamba 20 years when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends studied in high school, and he was a good guy older who for several years trying to teach her to play guitar.
In those years he enjoyed success with women.
All girls melts when it was close, "said Hairston, who is 40 and lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss at the time of the events, apparently met for some time.
During a call to 911 Lamb said: "I killed my wife", but there is no record of the registration of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gauthier in a brick house, which goes on the opposite side of the Channel.
According to police, the dog is OK.
The former husband of Prentiss, Sean O'stina reported they had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends, and they had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely overwhelmed," told O'stina about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'stina said he did not meet with the lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail, Lamb was interested in music and playing the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss, when he and Abigail both performed at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at the concerts.
O'stina said his daughter writes music and singing.
Prentice was a nurse and worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barman and part-time coordinator entertainment programs in a dimly lit bar Julep Room in the suburb of Gautier, said the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and tease each other over each other.
In the sense that they were both very canny.
Schmidt, a teacher, conducted seminars for freshmen and focused on the history of Native Americans and colonial America, "said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student government.
At Delta State University campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university professors, staff, students and community members attended a memorial ceremony in the lighting of candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang a Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We try to return to our students," said Forge.
The crisis has passed.
Today is the day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare the Associated Press writers Emily Wagster P. in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a police statement that Lamba entered service call 911 after Schmidt's murder, and also due to the fact that although Lamb and spoke of Prentiss as his wife called 911, the information that they were married, was not confirmed.

Michael J. Fox joked about "meetings" with Princess Diana
The premiere of the movie "back to the future" was for Michael J. Fox's grandiose event.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema and were waiting for the arrival of members of the royal family, I noticed that the seat next to me freely, and it dawned on me - Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a documentary "back in time".
The film begins, and it occurred to me that I was literally at arm and in one phony blunder from a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in time" - a documentary about the film "back to the future" - includes an interview with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of the movie "back to the Future" took place 30 years ago.
"For me," Spielberg says, "this is undoubtedly the greatest time travel film ever made".

The head of the UN declares that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in response to Russia's military support of Syria, which for nearly five years of conflict, "there is no military solution" and the growth of weapons will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The head of the UN again called for all participants, including the divided UN Security Council to unite and support inclusive talks to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - The United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that the divisions in the Council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities "made the intractable situation."
Ban Ki-moon urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated in addressing the issue of Iran's nuclear program, and when considering the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results that show that Donald Trump is not joking
Some have tried to label him a provocateur.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
And some require scandal.
But try as some Republicans shake the high position of Donald Trump in the polls, they failed (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trump in double figures, and some are starting to seriously ask what this means for the real estate tycoon from the point of view of a chance to get a nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to win the Republican Party.
The experts indicates that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry concedes premishchevo gaining popularity of Herman Cain, none of whom won and one state in the nominating process.
And there are plenty of reasons why he would fight for the general election.
But outside groups, such as "drive political actity" Jeb Bush, and economic conservative groups "Club for Growth" recognize an unrelenting strength of Trump and begin to get their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some numbers of surveys suggest that the real estate mogul is not just an intermediate phase:
Ratings of sympathy for Trump spun 180 degrees.
Immediately before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in the middle of June, the Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive attitude to this real estate magnate.
By the middle of July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive attitude to Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators will prevail in the initial stages.
Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of Republicans there polozhtelno belong to Trump.
Two thirds of those who voted for the GOP would suit Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either treated "with delight" or "satisfaction" if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "disappointed" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say they would be treated "with delight" against 40 percent who said the same thing about Trump).
The next level of delight?
Marco Rubio, who is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they are "not satisfied" or "disappointed" if the establishment favorite Jeb Bush will become a candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's temperament problem.
While Trump was widely criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent of Republicans voters across the country think the tycoon had the right temperament to be president, as the ABC News/Washington Post poll showed on Monday.
The same figure appears in the first caucus state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he's the man who may be the main commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think he is not a man who can be effective in the post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Voters Republicans are accustomed to these thoughts.
When they wear their hats connoisseurs, voters Republicans think Trump is seriously.
On the question of who is the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is not the case when four of the 10 were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have previously had no proper magical crystal.
At the same time, the last cycle cycle four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, it shows that many GOP voters consider convincing Trump campaign.
Even if the Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump would still be ahead of all others.
Some pundits point out that this variation is likely to play to the advantage of Trump, and at the same time do not support Trump evenly distributed among the support of more than a dozen other candidates.
But Monmouth University poll conducted in early September shows that in a hypothetical contest "one on one" between Trump and the majority of other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and, finally, Rand Paul, John Keshich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He had a draw with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who bypasses him?
Ben Carson overtakes a businessman on the whole 19 points in a hypothetical contest "one on one".
A little more than half of Donald Trump's supporters say they will change your mind.
The new CBS/NYT poll, conducted on Tuesday, shows that just over half of voters supporting Trump, say they are confident in their voices.
Obviously, a lot of things can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, that Mr. Trump had the most intense competition at the moment - with a colleague outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they would most likely choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump over immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his speech, the campaign, immigration has become the most important topic in conversations in 2016.
Some worry that Trump posturing of key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and will prevent rebranding.
But according to the ABC/Post poll conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So long as immigration attracts attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Frustration with the government is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson will now count on support from about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday a new ABC/Post poll said they want a political outsider rather than a person with experience in government.
And they also resent Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa is disappointed with the activities of the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "discontented" and 21 percent "in anger".
The government will decide the fate of the indexation of pensions in October.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for ways to enforce the law on indexation of pensions in 2016 at a real rate of inflation, transmits the WP.
She noted that the solution must be found by October 8, by the time of the draft budget for next year in the government.
In addition, the cabinet will discuss the prolongation of the decision to freeze the pension savings of Russians.
Golodets noted the amount of pension savings is equal to 350 billion roubles.
Roughly the same costs indexation of pensions in full for the next year.
According to Deputy Prime Minister until there is a final decision on the question of who should pay fees for unemployed citizens.
Golodets believes that if a person does not work on their own initiative and does not apply, however, to the socially vulnerable categories of citizens, not quite true that society pays for it.
The media had previously reported that the cabinet is considering two options for balancing the budget.
Why are often disturbed and blush eyelids?
Ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashov replies:
Our eyelids is a screen to protect the eyeball from a multitude of small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting the regular cleaning of their own age, we often promote the development of blepharitis.

Syrian President Bashar Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident if Europe wants to deal with the problem of refugees, then they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accept or not accept refugees, but it is necessary to eliminate the root causes of this problem.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the essence of the question of refugees," he said in an interview with RT.

Jeremy Corbyn will debut in the session of questions the Prime Minister
After the election of Mr Corbyn as his prime minister is expected to debut at the session of questions with great impatience
The new leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn will soon be performing at the first session of questions of the prime minister, for the first time, their strength with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will perform with the first of six allocated issues in the second half of the day; his performance is likely to be closely monitoring the press and members of parliament from the Labour party.
He made an appeal for "less theater and more facts" on the weekly demonstration of speech.
He also said he might skip some meetings, leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn as leader; it will happen after the appointment of the shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Trade Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silently during the performance of the national anthem at the service on Tuesday, during a celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain provoked criticism from a number of Conservative members of parliament and became the subject of several advanced articles in newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he "stood in respectful silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, a member of the shadow cabinet, Mr Corbyn Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "independently" from his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in a team of Mr. Corbyn, voicing disagreement on issues of the economy, defence and international policy, while less than one sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political disagreements also "socialcultural pile" in the Labour party after the appointment of Mr Corbyn to the position in the European Union and limit government compensation payments.
Mr Corbyn said at a trade union conference that the Labour party has made amendments aimed at abolishing the idea of limitations as a whole.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, said the party has "complete clarity" on account of the fact that it was only in opposition to government plans to reduce the upper limit from 26 000 pounds to 23 000 pounds.
Mr Corbyn will become the fifth leader of the Labour party, with whom David Cameron will meet the "courier box" in the last ten years since he became leader of the Conservative party.
The Labour leader promised a different approach to politics, says he "attracted collective resources" to collect ideas of questions to Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of parliament from the district Ailington North said that questions the Prime Minister make the confrontation, and that he would refrain from witty answers and exchange of wit, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, minister of economy in the shadow cabinet will replace him on the issues of a Prime Minister when he will be absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the word of the possibility, saying that he spoke to the speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow to discuss the issue.
After becoming leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to get away from the political style of "fair buffoonery" often associated with the procedure of the prime minister, but acknowledged a few years later, he failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990 questions the Prime Minister became a key indicator of opinion leaders, their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of parliament, although critics claim it is turned into a caricature and requires large-scale reforms.

Metcash will launch a campaign on the initiative from the bottom to fight the onslaught of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its advertising from the onslaught of Aldi stores in South Australia and Western Australia.
Wholesale supplier of food at the bottom of the initiative launched a campaign to protect market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of the forthcoming injections of the Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is preparing to open the first of two warehouses and 120 stores in Southern and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and promote brand IGA in the leading media and marketing through social networks and at events such as "Adelaide show".
Join the campaign to retailers and suppliers of IGA, such as Simmo's ice cream manufacturer from Dansboro, which offers tastings in IGA stores, and owners of shops selling regular customers with discount tickets for South Australian Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29 - the day when the wholesale supplier of food, alcoholic beverages and household goods will hold its annual investor day strategies.
A lot is at stake, as in South Australia and Western Australia stores under the IGA brand accounts for nearly 30 percent of all stores Metcash and show a higher profit margin than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in the South and Western Australia known as adherents of habitual routes, so the market is more favorable for IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in YuA and 24 per cent in WA, compared with about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi otobjet 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months after opening its first store, taking sales from all present players, but mainly from independent retailers.
The report, published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales for the year, and Metcash - 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 - in WA, achieving sales of 500 million and 600 million dollars in these markets, respectively.
The loss of revenues and sales volumes of food at a high level of fixed costs Metcash could cost the company nearly 13 million earnings before interest and taxes, says Mr Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, a recent study of Morgan survey found that IGA's most loyal customers.
The Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash food sales fell by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, a leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, noticed the audience at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "may be likely to disappear within a decade.
The company Metcash declined to comment on the comments of Mr. Douglass.
But it is expected that a member of the board of directors of the company Metcash contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
The share of IGA fell on the market since 2010 from 18 to 14 per cent, while revenues from Metcash food business, which the company delivers approximately 1,200 IGA retailers fell by 43 per cent compared to 2012 due to operational deleverage and due to pressure on sales performance and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually for the equalization of retail prices with prices at Coles and Woolworths on thousands of items every week and helping retailers IGA in rebuilding trading platforms, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider range of branded food products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says the equalization of prices and refurbishment of the retail space is gaining momentum, and hopes that the company will achieve an increase in net profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supports Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves merit rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis indirectly suffered in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Kirios and for his behavior deserves honor more than critics, says Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in the talented duo and often called the "Special Ks", unwittingly found himself at the center of attention because of the shameful skirmish Kirlosa with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after that, during the hottest qualifying match in Cincinnati judge had twice conducted apart Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, Harrison said: "Wawrinka must be laid on the Kirios blades, and I have to lay on the blades of this guy."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking rackets after cramp in his leg saved Richard Gasquet from possible defeat at the US Open, Healy faithfully defends Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomic in the singles in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I am acutely worried about one thing, namely that the Thanasi dragged into the conflict," said Healy.
He actually broke a racket when he drove his leg at the US Open, but he is not the first player to break the racquet when the collapse of hope, and I know Thanasi well enough to be sure that he wouldn't do it proud.
But actually he owned himself very well in fairly provocative situations for us, with Harrison, etc., and I am sure that he deserves trust.
It is surrounded by a great team, he has a wonderful family, and I just think it was a bit unfair.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works perfectly fits into the team, he had never had problems with other players, his respected outside court, he's training, he's in good shape, he's very determined and developed a young man, and I think it should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kirlosa for an important match, starting on Friday, believing the "mutual consent" is the right option for everyone, but hoping that guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus on the match and not on disputes around [Kirlosa]," said Healy.
And I think Nick gained strength very quickly that prove people like Federer and Murray, it grows in the eyes of the public, he made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to help him understand the consequences of their actions, and it is necessary, I believe, to bring him out of the center of attention for some time so he could reflect on them, and it is best for the team and best for him.
The migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces emergency, closing the border, detain migrants
By declaring a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia on the southern border and detain those who are trying to enter the country illegally to keep flowing into the flow of migrants.
The unrest occurred at the border - has accumulated hundreds of migrants on the border area, which dramatically reacted negatively on the Serbian authorities.
Stuck indefinitely at a checkpoint on the road between the two countries, people fleeing armed violence at home, smashed tents and settled in the area.
However, growing discontent.
When a police helicopter circling above them, the migrants were shouting "open the borders!" and hurled insults at the Hungarian police.
Some in the protest refused food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister declared "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, when they are more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution to the problem rather than collateral damage.
It is necessary in the coming days to hold negotiations with Brussels and other countries, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest at the Serbian border started the next day after a block of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to take total responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in crowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future (in the next month or by the end of the year) will be reached, according to which the Member States of the European Union will take another 120 000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Austria on Tuesday demanded to assemble an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis that has gripped the continent.
Hungary, however, hopes for quick action on the part of Brussels or neighbors.
On Tuesday declared a state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to act against the crisis that allowed them to cut off roads and speed up court cases for asylum.
Meanwhile, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Vengy Peter Sillarto said his country plans to erect a fence with barbed wire on the border with Romania to halt the flow of migrants through the country, now that she has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagat reported that even prisoners were connected to the urgent work on the completion of the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main "bottleneck" and the EU's border crossing point for migrants, many of whom are refugees - victims of the war in Syria and the countries of the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the country's Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a more prosperous life, not refugees - victims of military actions that have the right to protection, and this view is sharply at odds with the views of the other EU countries, including Germany.
The new law, which took effect at midnight in Hungary, consider now a crime crossing or damage 4-metrový (13-foot) fence with barbed wire, built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison sentences for defendants in trafficking.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declared a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We clearly understand: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Parliament must still formally authorize the deployment of military forces that is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are on the border, already within a few days there to observe the presence of armed to the teeth with military vehicles and dogs.
György Bakondi, Orban's adviser on national security, reported apprehending authorised bodies of 45 people who tried to cross the border, the border, and another 15 people inside the country.
They crossed the border, breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities quickly re-established the fence.
The Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of seven passes on the border with Serbia, driving to block one of the railway passes, festooned with barbed wire.
The unrest broke out at the main passage across the border near the town of Rosok (Hungary), as Hungarians placed premises for missing people inside the metal container, and crowds of people pushing each other to break inside.
Approximately 20 individuals were able to penetrate inside, with thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary, and announced the abandonment of food and water until they brought in Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton advantage over Bernard Sanders has fallen by half in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the race for the nomination of Democrats across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders comes second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to participate in the presidential race, receives the support of 15 percent of primary voters are Democrats.
For more than five months before the start of competition in primary elections, the majority of Democratic voters say it is still too early to say that they are certain candidates who will support.
Clinton's supporters are more confident in their choices than podderzhvayuschy other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton holds a big advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has been reduced.
Her support among men has fallen substantially, and Sanders lags behind her only 5 points.
Preference for Clinton voters Democrats up to 50 years old, disappeared, and they are now on an equal footing with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton overtakes Sanders double-digit numbers among liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
Almost half of the Democratic primary voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate from the party.
A quarter would have supported her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she is a candidate.
Six per cent would not have supported it.
Perhaps it is not surprising that the current supporters of Clinton are likely to show more enthusiasm at its expense.
Among those who are currently not supporting Clinton, more controversial views - only about a quarter of her enthusiastically supported.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer voters Republicans say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When supporters of Clinton set an open question, why do they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then - now women president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the post (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also say the association linking her with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also called soglasnya on the issues and the chances of election.
As the vice president is contemplating potential participation in the election, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would want him to join the race - although a third believes that he should not.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among the candidates from the party's primary voters Democrats in most cases called Biden.
Among supporters of Clinton, more than half said they would choose Biden's second, it is more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run from the Democratic Party, the advantage of Hillary Clinton over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the participants of the race up to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of voters Democrats see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, the figure fell from 78 percent last month.
The Biden with a big lag in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate, increased.
However, the answer to the question of what is most important in a candidate, voters Democrats choose other options beyond the chances of being elected.
The same situation last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates is not an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have shown good results in some key characteristics among primary voters from his party.
Clinton, Sanders and Biden considers most honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden from all three leading to honesty, and the strong side of Clinton in her leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters think Clinton is not honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have a definite opinion about him on this account.
Primary voters Democrats also generally consider similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden.
On all these measures, about a quarter of voters Democrats do not have any opinions about Sanders.
Although questions regarding personal e-mail account and server at her Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was continuing, the majority of primary voters Democrats are satisfied with her explanation on this account and believe that this does not impact negatively on their general opinion about it.
But this is a different story from the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are dissatisfied with its explanation, and satisfied with only around one third.
Public opinion is still divided about this in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say the controversy over the e-mail does not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent say their opinion of it deteriorated.
Basically it is Republicans, more than six out of every 10 people who claim their opinion about Clinton deteriorated.
Even though Clinton consider fair and credible voters from her party, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 percent think it is fair and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 compared with May.
Sixty two percent of registered voters did not consider her honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not think Trump is honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, get good marks on leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested Biden, Carson and Bush show the best result of fairness.
Most see Sanders rather honest man than not, but, as Carson, many do not have any opinions about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of a national survey of Ben Carson closely approached Donald Trump
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll
These two candidates scored half of the votes of the voters in the new poll, leaving all others in search of support under the feet
Voters Republicans across the country continue to massively support Trump, the percentage of support which has increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll conducted on the eve of the debate on Fox News last month, up 27 percent in the poll conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson has soared over the same period from 6% to 23%.
The poll also showed that Carson enjoys support in all demographic groups, bunched up Trump in a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, rolled back together with the governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator from Florida, Marco Rubio together occupy third place with 6%.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this new poll is plus or minus 6%, the poll conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll, published last week, showed Carson's rise in the polls - demonstrating the support of 19% among Republicans, Trump with 32 percent support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is ahead of Carson.
Due to the growth of Carson's support last week, Trump has made several critical attacks against the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for having questioned Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are accused in the death of Baruch College freshman
Approximately two years later, after the death of a college student during an initiation ritual in the Brotherhood in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania murder charges were brought against five people.
"Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity from New York's Baruch College brutally attacked Chan" Michael "Deng during an initiation ceremony in September 2013 and did not deliver it on time to the hospital that caused his death," police said.
Officials say the students blindfolded and 30-funtovyi backpack with sand behind pushing several times as he tried to reach the goal, going on the slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and presumably still waited an hour before to deliver him to the hospital, police said.
They, however, have found the time to change clothes Deng, find a gauge of his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood to ask the Council, said at a news conference, Police Chief Chris Wagner.
"At this moment the members of the Brotherhood began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the Brotherhood above the health of Michael Deng," the chef said Wagner.
He failed to save, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, received a few blunt injuries to the head, torso and hips.
"Too many families have suffered as a result of the initiation rituals in the Brotherhood, because at least one student died during them every year since 1970," he said in his statement, Douglas Feiberg-Iccar, a lawyer representing the family of Deng.
The Brotherhood and their members should be accountable, and this move by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County jurors in favour of a third degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty two other members, including Mr. Meng, was blamed for violence against newcomers and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned it all officially or unofficially, and her," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood excluded from its local branch structure.
What will happen when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates
The rate hike will happen, and "bull market" stumbles, bond yields will rise and the economy will fall into recession.
This we know.
What we don't know is how long it will take before, and how long this will continue.
Specifically for the economy there is little story explains about the time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hikes and as much as 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
However, the administration of the central bank of the US so strongly emphasizes that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, but how many will take the adaptation.
Indeed, a lot of variables in the game.
Eventually, however, market participants may find that the whole fuss about raising rates is exaggerated.
"The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of" cheap money "," said Julian Jessop, chief international economics specialist at Capital Economics, in its comments for clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return to more normal interest rates in the US, but still low levels will be seismic momentum that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that the consequences will not be.
Here's a look at how they could respond to some areas of the economy depending on historical trends:
As the market has already seen over the last month or so, the expectation of rising rates could lead to volatility for some time.
In raising rates, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It is unlikely that the income from shares filibustered for 12-24 months after the first jump, which, again, probably reflects a delay in monetary policy," said analysts at Deutsche Bank in a recent study of the results of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
If specifically, the market roughly over the last 35 years, often dramatically changes - some 14 percent - toward raising rates, remains smooth enough for 250 days after that (the average growth of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returned to normal with an average yield of 14.4 percent in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief equity trading strategy specialist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche said the result for securities tends not to immediately become more pronounced at higher rates, and income from stocks begin to shrink.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but increasing rates often play them contribute.
In this case, the Federal Reserve put in such conditions that existed before and could accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point during the existence of increased rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases povyshenya rates since 1950 only twice the annual nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few believe it for a long time, while in the third quarter he kept at the level of only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates for such an unstable economic background can be risky and raises the question "whether this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates by the Federal Reserve system the whole year, with their focus on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many experts on strategies and economists believe that the FOMC could approve a rate hike at this meeting, futures trading suggests only a 25-per-cent probability.
"In our study since 1950 all cycles raising rates until today were in the supercycle increased financial leverage with GDP, peaks, anticipating a recession, very quickly after the beginning of the recovery," says the report.
By contrast, this was extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle at the moment - long, which the Federal Reserve has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, it lasts already 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market expects to raise rates, and this scenario is in some ways similar to those implemented for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that in effect for bonds nastupet faster than for stocks when the federal system is changing the strategic course.
In the case of bonds seems to yield changes the vector immediately after the first povychenie/umenyshenie rates in the cycle.
At the end of a cycle of increasing rates, bond yields will immediately fall ", according to Deutsche.
The strategy of Charles Schwab specialists believe that raising rates will lead to levels of long-term and short-term bond yields converge, making a flat curve.
High yield bonds often behave better in such a climate, although "we are still afraid of yield fluctuations," says the study, Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the policy of the federal system.
"In addition to the strengthening dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans rose, more flat yield curve, credit spreads widened, volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the tightening policy of the federal system.
Speaking in general, companies, leading its main business in the United States, will benefit from rising interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with lots of debts will be worse off, as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global space market, and their debt is more expensive - financially.
"History shows that" quality "stocks demonstrate the effectiveness of higher market within three months after the initial increase rates," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
The company outperformed the company with a stable financial condition with unstable state based on the results of each increase rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004, an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with a high return on equity, as well as stocks with low volatility also showed better efficiency than low quality stocks, on average 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
The debt will become a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange deals, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Depositors could see profits through higher yields, though experts disagree on how quickly it will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of the Classic FM," says a member of parliament from the Conservative Andrew Bigha
A member of parliament from the Conservative Andrew Bigha criticized the station for "lower standards"
Proves that it is becoming increasingly less distinct from commercial competitor
Also aiming at the BBC Music Awards, saying the prize simply peeled from Thursday
According to the parliament's colleague Robert Collins, on The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM," said the leader of the members of parliament, prompting the company to prove that she is doing something that doesn't make commercial companies.
Conservative Member of Parliament Andrew Bigha also told the BBC that it seems as if the public radio station "always causes stupidity" and is becoming increasingly less distinct from its commercial rivals.
"Radio 3 seems to me - I don't like to use the word" simplification "- but it seems she turns into a Classic FM," he said.
He is also aiming at the BBC Music Awards prize, launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Double under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - here are two examples that first came to mind, in which you actually only duplicate what is already on the market, "said Mr. Bigha.
The BBC's director general has rejected the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and education audiences.
What I learn thanks to Radio 3, I don't know about classical music more than anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and the creation of music actually compares more than with anybody.
"Also really very important, I think the interest of Radio 3 in search of new music and the promotion of new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davie argued that radio stations have to work far more to attract an audience than in the past, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, it was not the only brainchild of BBC Radio 3, which has been attacked for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of parliament from the Tory Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a music talent show, which the BBC has bought the Dutch Talpa Media for the estimated price of 22 million pounds Sterling.
You can see why this program is often discussed in connection with the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall said the BBC 1 show, in which the judges participate Paloma Faith and Boy George, was done in a "typical BBC style".
He added that he wants from the corporation to "find a hit in their own home stables" next time it will be running an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of the new season Of The Voice in the future or the use of money to those who pay the license fee to other entertainment formats.
As internet sales growth slowed in August, and that the fault may be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase in online sales by seven percent
Last month marked the slowest growth since it began to observe in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could help to curb spending
For about ten years, the virtual shopping is experiencing a boom, transforming many central streets in Britain in the city of ghosts.
But experts say that there are signs of leveling online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven-percent increase during the first three months of 2015.
Total spending on online shopping in August showed minimal growth since they began in 2000, an increase of just five percent.
Experts say that there are signs of leveling online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven-percent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and return back to 2000, they will always find a reasonable explanation," said the Guardian's Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago, when buyers began to use their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do this in any conditions, for example, sitting on the couch.
But now it goes on the plateau, and you can see the decline (growth).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for slowing sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, the number of buyers is five times more than the average hurried back to computers to take advantage of lucrative offers, pushing the number of websites of sellers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers come into a real fight for lucrative purchases, could compel people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a little more than 1 out of every 5 pound sterling is spent online.
As for goods such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, rather than in fashionable stores in central streets.
Muslims bury killed when the crane collapse in Mecca, and the family of bin Laden imposed sanctions
Muslims sneaked 29 dead bodies through the streets, as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group

Hundreds of Muslims everywhere flocked to the streets to bury 29 out of the number of victims who died as a result of the collapse of the crane at the main mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mostly in white, present at the funeral of overran the street to pay homage to the first of the number of victims who went to his last journey to the cemetery Al Moaissem.
The sad procession passed the sacred place where only a few days earlier, a construction crane struck the ceiling of the mosque and fell to parishioners.
The bodies were issued for the funeral, and at the same time the king of the Saudis fined construction company owned by the family of bin Laden, for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who perished when a crane collapsed at the main mosque, carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was in his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr Akram was in the main mosque, together with their parents before the start of the annual hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin group should not leave the arrow crane was raised when a broken faucet.
In the Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group are partly to blame for the collapse.
The English edition of the news agency did not describe these details, but said that the company's leaders banned from travelling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the cause of the fall of the crane into the yard of the main mosque where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to this month to go to Hajj.
Binladin group made no statements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not available for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company in the non-use of modern security measures and inadequate coordination with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the main mosque of Mecca, as part of a large-scale construction work that leads the Binladin Group.
Bin Laden's family for decades is close to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia and manages major construction projects.
The late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was the son of a traitor, from whom the family repudiated in the 1990s.
The accident occurred when strong winds and rain in just a few days before the Kingdom profit of millions of people to participate in the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in their life for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million riyals (about 174 million pounds) to the relatives of the dead, and the same amount of irreversibly crippled.
The remaining victims will receive half that amount.

Kingfisher is hardly the only company where exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the general and finance director.
Ms. Laurie said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Find suitable women in the board of directors were easy.
After the group took on the costs of closing stores, the company Kingfisher showed decline in profit and sales volumes for six months.
As a result of this trend Kingfisher, which owns B&amp;Q and Screwfix brands, opens up 200 new stores
The decision by the US Federal Reserve interest rate
The world is watching the Federal Reserve Bank meeting, where for two days to discuss important decisions - or not to raise interest rates for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters, revealed that a little more than half of those who still believed last week that the Federal Reserve is going to now believe he is still delaying and will keep the rate at the level of the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, because it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to zero.
For the first time we come to what the central bank might move to zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is working effectively, the economic recovery will add trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets that should prepare for changes, but everyone speaks about their confidence that all the odds against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" Chanted hundreds of refugees from the checkpoint Horgoš on Serbian Hungarian border.
Budapest on Tuesday closed the border for migrants.
Asylum seekers have already begun to other options of routes into the EU.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia lies through Romania.
Another - through Croatia and Slovenia - in Austria.
According to some reports, the buses that were carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary, now heading towards the city Shida on the Croatian border.
Drivers received an order from the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojša Stepanovich assures that his country was doing all it could to help refugees, but its opportunities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, provide a humane attitude towards them.
But this is a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve, no country in Europe alone cannot cope with it, and especially such a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is tough:
If someone called a refugee in Serbia he must fill out the necessary documents.
And if he does, and it kept our country, because Serbia is quite safe.
Hungary has already erected 175-tikilometrový fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to build a fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that it is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: "Europe wants us to help.
Vangelis Meimarakis for a number of years in the center-right government led by the left the country to the financial crisis.
Now he became the interim leader of the party of "new democracy", throws down a challenge to Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met a journalist euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to euronews.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat, relinquishing the Syriza coalition, but now, judging by the polls, "New Democracy" popularity compared to it.
What has changed during that time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed as we are.
Mr. Tsipras has lied in January of last year.
Nine months ago, Greece has a budget surplus and the prospects for economic growth.
Now the country is again a budget deficit and high unemployment.
Investors have gone, because Mr. Tsipras ejected them.
In the past nine months, the Greeks had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promise of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare the promised with what actually happened.
Daily life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and it concerned the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that in the event of an election victory will seek alliances with other parties, including Syriza.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The point is that, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where they operate or still operate the rescue program, political forces and all the ruling parties will come together to implement the program on which they have reached agreement without abandoning its political or ideological autonomy.
That's why I firmly believe that at this stage only cooperation between political forces and institutions will allow the country to go forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in support of the agreement between Mr Tsipras and creditors of the country.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you do this agreement, or try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: We actually voted for the movement of Greece in the European path, because well, ruinous consequences would lead the country out of the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity fund, Juncker and assistance package in the banking sector.
All of this would be lost if there was no agreement with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of how Mr. Tsipras led the negotiations.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe will see that the new Greek government during his first year in power wants to establish order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then, I am sure, all accepted commitments that cannot be met because of what lead to recession, can again become the subject of negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to assume that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors because they expect the full implementation of the agreements.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue to privatization, reforms and structural changes that were agreed by continuing to enjoy the benefits of the EU funding and large investment opportunities that we must open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues that we found out, discussing these issues with our European counterparts.
I can lead an example of the incomes of farmers.
We have explained our European partners that we are not talking about a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot fully taxed in advance.
We replied that Tsipras ministers never talked about it.
That is, Greek ministers were not prepared and poorly informed, and therefore poorly negotiated and concluded the unfortunate agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will find yourself at the same table with Mr Juncker, Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will differ from what you tell them, from what told them your predecessor Antonis Samaras?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014 we have tried the best way to fulfill the agreement of 2012, bypassing the sharp corners.
We will push forward reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and was not visible to potential buyers willing to pay the price, the Greek government.
I was at that time was the speaker of the Parliament, I managed to reconcile the views of the three parliamentary groups then the government majority.
And despite their serious ideological disagreements on key bills, we had a working parliament, and it is in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would have continued to improve, if the process was not interrupted early general elections, the result of the December presidential election.
Euronews: Last week on the territory of Greece is moving a massive flow of refugees.
What do you think about this situation, and about the reactions of European countries that aspire to these people?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a ticking time bomb with which we have to deal after winning the election.
And the reason is that the Syriza government has not acted in this situation as they should.
In such matters should act on the curve, because if the problem gets you, remain only extraordinary measures.
And we are now in such a situation.
Even the interim government, Syriza, for only seven days has done more than Mr Tsipras made for seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which provides valuable assistance to the president of the Republic, called for an EU summit will help to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice - refugees are not illegal immigrants.
It is the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that have occurred with them.
This question has deeply humanitarian aspect, and we will stick to the position that European policymakers should take in this new situation.
The decision should be taken at the EU summit, should be involved and the United Nations.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and refugee reception centres.
We also need to effectively use the economic assistance that we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, thank you.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you

A man who opened fire at Delta State University, left a note with apologies
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note that says he "regrets" about the first murder and wanted to "bring back", the authorities said on Tuesday.
Police in the town of Gautier, Mississippi, reported that a teacher of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, call 911 about 10 o'clock in the morning.
on Monday and reported that he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police need to send people to him.
He said: "Last night I killed my wife," and also mentioned that in the house there is a "dog" who "touched" nobody, but probably upset.
Police asked the caller's name, but he was not called.
Lamb has not explained why he opened fire.
Arriving at a crime scene, police discovered the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamba, 45, said: "I regret I would like to bring everything back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
Write a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a teacher of history, and on Monday evening when he was surrounded by police, committed suicide.
The rector of the University of William forge said he was not aware of any conflict between the lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamba clearly had something on his mind."
Despite reported on Monday that lamb assumed a novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, the official service on Tuesday reported an "absence of any information or evidence" "love triangle".
About Prentiss said as a "good man" Sean O'stina, who said he was married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'stina told him he and Prentiss have a daughter, 19, and that she was "inconsolable".
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the newspaper "San Herald" called a close girlfriend Prentiss, the latest work from home via the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss was a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she had met lamb for about three years.
Knowles said: "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb on Monday at some point called relatives to say that "he will not go to jail."
In the evening of the same day when the police caught him on the highway "1" near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out, ran into the woods and shot himself.
According to a summary posted on the university website, the 2015 spring lamb received at Delta State University degree of Doctor of Science in the field of pedagogy.
The stars who lost their luck
The actor (left), photos with his son Redmond (right), survived a few difficult years.
In 2001 he fought with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long life Terah Fawcett, who died of cancer.
Reportedly, the actor also suffered from addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All this has certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United went out for several months because of the double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champions League match in which Manchester United lost PSV Eindhoven.
While the defender is going through on this occasion, which will not be able to get on the field at least for six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that the show will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during the reckless you drove Hector Moreno in the 15th minute when the 20-year-old PSV show burst into the penalty area.
He assisted on the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He had a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He was transported to Manchester tomorrow or the day later, and then operated.
This is terrible - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, has overcome great difficulties and began to play fantastic, and then this happened.
In the dressing room it was an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it is for six months, and the guy will not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he will be able to play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he has not received a red card and a penalty was not appointed.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli will not punish Mexican.
Van Gaal believes that an Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say that it is worth a penalty and red card.
It was a very wrong you drove with two legs.
In his Twitter show writes: "Thank you all for your messages, words cannot describe how I emptied my path to recovery begins, I will come back even stronger than it was."
Still on the topic: Manchester United is experiencing misfortune with Luke Shaw in the defeat in the game with PSV
The British defender will have an additional incentive to recuperate for the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "This is a very severe injury."
When any player knocked out with a similar injury, all very upset with this.
This was never the intention of our players - to traumatize the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Wang Galya at the World Cup 2014.
"It is very difficult now, because he had no intention to injure an opponent, and when you hear that this is a very severe injury, feels unwell," Cocu said.
I have not had the opportunity to see the moment.
The only thing I can see is the ball that flew in another direction, so it looked as if he (Moreno) touched him, but I didn't see you drove under Luke.
In an interview with 'Moreno said: "I know what it's like, I know how difficult it is to move.
It is very difficult for me, and I'm very sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also taken to hospital after the collision with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know about "The Lorax" anything else?
Every parent is very quickly learned one thing: if your child like a book, it will take a little time before retiring to know her almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you are David Cameron.
When asked by a representative of the company dealing with children's holiday vacation, about their favorite children's book, the prime minister chose "The Lorax" is a fairy tale with ecological bias, written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in comments published on the company's website supercamps, and continues: "This is funny, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to their children, because it always reveals any image or message that we will miss."
And all would be well, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the eponymous film shot in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify a short original narrative.
"Surrounded by high walls Vsemnugwill city, where there was no Greens and even the air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams, performing her desire is to see a real tree," we read in the text description of the love story, an unknown Dr Seuss (real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If it looks suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads almost like a summary of the plot of the movie "The Lorax" posted on The Internet Movie Database website: "Surrounded by high walls Vsemnugwill city where everything was artificial and even the air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron was, admittedly, active parents are so unfamiliar with the contents of the book, which is not named after the boy learns how to destroy the environment greedy loggers trees and vyazalshchik "vsemnuzhka" Nakhodkins, despite the protests of the Lorax (whose name was made in the name of the book) is a ridiculous creature with a mustache, "says the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a simple PR task was assigned to the contractor, the child never read a book about the Lorax 20 times in a row.
A spokesman for Downing Street said the text was allegedly received from Cameron's office in the constituency.
The company supercamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron’s staff, but there was no further comment.
For Adam Lita clearly there was a risk not to get into the England squad, but it is still a complicated question
Victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England selected for this tour, the repetition of defeat in the Test series with the score 3-0, happened last time, does not seem likely to me.
I would not rule out a victory in his field.
Alastair Cook's team, perhaps less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but it has taken off among the players, masterly curve, and collective thinking badly; they do not bring with scars from 2012, and only positive youth.
Moen Ali with the ball turns into a bowler, Lisle balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he was an unknown figure to Test level, represents an aggressive option.
Still on the topic: Adam Lita dropped out of the England Test cricket and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to exclude Adam Lita to me, his main coach in "Yorkshire", of course, it is difficult to analyze.
In his seven Test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and obvious, but the brutal reality is that cricket players are judged by judges on the result.
There were no questions on John Rood, for example, that led to this announcement, because (and I have said this before) the best players choose themselves.
A couple of fifty, and Lita could wait a longer career, but he was in the power of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for the "Yorkshire", there will be another possibility.
The England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, about his mood, even when he does not show what I can do, and this does not surprise me; he is primarily a team player, and then everything else.
The question is, how much time will pass before the batsmen Test cricket will leave the impression is a complicated question.
Lita played in seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton - in nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and in a foreign field.
The only thing you could complain - something that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lita was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity is already in the past.
Alex appears Hails, and batsman, which I appreciate.
He's unpredictable cricketers that we saw in the Yorkshire club at the start of this season, when he earned 236 in the match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should be at least given the same opportunities as those who came before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
Thought to put Moena next to Cooke as opening batsmen, which would give the opportunity to introduce additional spinners, keeping four fast bowlers, considering, and I am not against it.
I don't see any reason why they can't beat the player hit the ball and the lefty has already shown he is a damn good cricketers.
Moen, perhaps not exactly what you need for their county of Worcestershire, but became the third number for them, and there is a big difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches "third batsmen" before being released as in 2001.
He won just three hundred and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the national team as a reserve spinner, and during my brief conversation with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his approximate statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a risky bet, but among spinners voting "for" a little, and selected selected youth.
He has learned in this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the trainers.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardin, Sri Lankan batsmen, as a consultant for the Test match could be a brilliant move.
He's one of the best guys to play, which will bring a wealth of experience gained in all possible conditions and in any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both the energy and relentless pace in Setapa.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether playing or coaching, and as Mahela, has a great intellect.
Sometimes a new voice in the locker room, even if they say what has been said previously, could give new strength to the team.
Collie team Durham colleague Ben Stokes left for mayflies, Ruth provided a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, is not concerned about this problem.
Although not everyone will agree, coaches and players selected individuals will not determine the schedule.
And you must remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never accepted easily.
The camp of supporters of Britain's exit from the EU could win if the economy will be depressed by 2017
David Cameron’s ill-conceived policy to resume talks about keeping Britain in the EU every day feels increasingly difficult, even without regard to the election genius Jeremy camera yes or no? "- Corbyn Labour leader or TUC resentment over Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Faraj.
Friendly European diplomat explained the other day that in a situation where the EU is now experiencing a variety of crises - not all of them own production - some member countries are fed up with the British self-centred divisive agenda concessions and undermining the arrangements of the changes, which they mostly don't want.
Gathered in Brighton for the annual meeting, TUC decided that he did not want them in any case if they destroy social protection.
We could even call it "program selfi Dave and George."
The Prime Minister and the finance minister riding around the summit and bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, photographed themselves against the backdrop of a well-known local monument, in the company of local celebrities or without it, then come home and say they attract the allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to have an interest in maintaining external contacts to Britain under the awning of the EU - "Don't leave us together with France," says Berlin - proposes that blinkered ministers and officials in some capitals reached an understanding when they are all the same, we will stay or go.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is a very cautious ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation deteriorates, as she deteriorated for her to sit in place of Thatcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Kohl (16).
French President Francois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He also loses strength.
Poland may soon receive a right-wing nationalist government, Spain - left.
It is hard to see them out to help "Selfi Brit", whose energy could have been used to prevent the exit of Scotland from the UK - they don't want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even plan to issue deliberately useless by the SNP during the referendum campaign in Britain in 2017 to spur the process of Britain's exit from the EU, suggests my friend.
"The review was an obsession" and "Britain has not received anything of value from renewed negotiations."
Europeans have the misfortune to know what could be a predator Fleet Street, and how skeptical towards the EU media tycoons, unlike the Times running Tony Benn referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 the ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, an inveterate Euro opportunists, the EU became known for his "straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
For all his stupidity Ed Milliband knew who his enemies.
They included a gaudy company from fear of taxes rogues, phone hackers, outsiders and pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was absolutely the same opinions about them, but aware that when you are in a cage with a gorilla, you should give her bananas to distract her and not let it eat you for lunch and tea again.
In fact Milliband was more of Blair than Blair himself in opposition to the idea of Cameron about the referendum because Blair cedes the principles in favour of the EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him anything from this.
But proffering Jeremy Corbyn, who clapped me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time to spend it on me - it seems the risk to repeat the strategy of Neil Kinnock "boycott Murdoch" from the 1980s - a mistake and then, and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of interaction with the press - not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the air force he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I call the evolution sensitively.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalistic tendencies of UKIP and a wider range of "little England" among Tory supporters could probably say "yes".
This is the same thing as Hilary "benn, but not bennit" Benn said on radio and television this week, with his inner boy scout all refused to acknowledge that the appointment of Corbyn insufferable John mcdonnella "shadow" finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his father struggled to beat an old man on TV for disloyalty to colleagues on the Labour cabinet, without going too far and not losing his post in the cabinet.
Hilary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "under any circumstances" - the phrase Benn is not, said McDonnell, and not what J. K. told peers and members of parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, according to the universal opinion.
So there's no want to tell the Democrat and "my guy" Corbyn - remember, he touched me - even message discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 television seven days a week, and especially in the maelstrom of social networks, paranoia and betrayal.
It is not reasonable to give Cameron so easy to get away from Europe, allowing him to take for granted the support of Labour during the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the main misconception mcdonnella and Corbyn over EU membership - as part of the "bennitsky" economy of the besieged fortress - is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents whose narcissism generated a minor difference is a central principle in doctrinal disputes.
As for his delusions about NATO - Tom Watson unmoved that Hourigan will not agitate for the exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why Paris or Berlin to spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to Britain when it may be meaningless?
The US is already very disappointed with the weak British military action in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tories in power cuts to government spending, as I was reminded on Monday during a lunch at a forum called British influence security.
Experts have criticized the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
Funded by the government agency claims that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking, came at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are related to the tobacco industry, according to the researchers.
The experts, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with the Lancet criticized the evidence used by the agency Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published an important report - "a milestone" in the last month, calling him "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and some experts pointed to a connection with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month criticized the "extremely shaky argument" on the basis of which the PHE built its main conclusion.
BMJ article two other researchers wondering whether these statements under a "solid or choppy grounds".
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Keipwell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of health - the rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness".
According to them, the public expects that PHE statements that "the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes by about 95% less harmful than smoking" were based on a detailed analysis of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this is removed from the only 12 people who gathered to develop models multicriterial analysis of decision-making to summarize their opinions about the harm associated with various nicotinosoderjath products; the results of the meeting briefly described in scientific publications.
McKee and Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, the general director of reported that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also confirmed the certificates of bat in health in the sustainability report.
One of 12 people at the meeting announced the funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, not to mention the financing, which he reportedly previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation to choose members of the Council were not granted, but there are several well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which also announced funding for the publishing industry.
It was unclear whether the other participants of the meeting management experience in the tobacco business.
The meeting also visited the head of the tobacco directions in the PHE.
Scientific article published by the group, "gracefully agrees" with the fact that there is a lack of "compelling evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Keipwell.
However, none of these connections and limitations were not affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Keipwell told PHE statement that "at the moment there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive to bring children or non-smokers to smoking" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the statements BMJ had already given answers.
He explained: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two smoked all his life died from his addiction.
All the evidence implies that the health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to explore distant consequences.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what to prove and that does not prove the evidence, especially where the public had doubts about the relative dangers compared with tobacco.
About 80,000 people per year die from diseases associated with smoking and smoking costs the NHS 2 billion pounds per year.
Clearly pointed out the obvious - that although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they are only part of the harm caused by smoking - we carry out our tasks in front of the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 believes the BBC should stop the series Eastenders
The former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop producing programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would give a lot for such a successful show as a soap opera about the "Albert Square".
Johnson noted that the licensing fees should only be used to create such programs that are not produced by other British broadcasting companies.
He criticized the BBC for what the company puts the transfer of public broadcasting, which certainly looks only a small part of the audience at the peak airtime when competitors go show with high ratings, and on such channels as a broadcaster.
After BBC director general Tony Hall said the Corporation would like to collaborate with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had time for six years unsuccessfully trying to establish cooperation with the BBC while working for Channel 4.
"I can't get away from the idea that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast that could show competing companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told members of the House of Lords communications committee to investigate the future fate of the BBC.
If you save the license fee that I don't consider a good solution in the medium and long term, then the company should leave on the air only those programs that are not produced and not produced by other companies.
The Voice of the show goes on the air in a prime-time slot because the creators want to get the greatest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else he showed, ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to finance programs that could be sponsored by without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; admittedly, they have their own production.
Other channels will undoubtedly give much for her.
I don't understand how this can be a public broadcasting.
I don't think it is somehow the BBC would demean.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, head of channel Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC in the pursuit of ratings "due to the ambitions of the employees and because of their belief that this is the best way to get support for the long term".
His comments on the most popular show on the BBC Sky resonate with the comments of the executive director Tony Bolla, who in his memory McTaggart Lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, the BBC offered to sell series such as EastEnders.
Johnson noted that more niche transmission of BBC public character "continue to go to the broadcaster, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audience, but the company's function is performed, and this can be presented as an argument in sanctimonious sermons justifying income from licensing fees to 4 billion pounds:" well yes, of course, we do all these strange transfer that no one is looking. "
They put them into the slot, where no one will ever be watching them.
About the licensing fee Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system with regard to who is most of it.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds per year - a huge sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot of money, I wonder, are they so believe because they don't really watch and listen to the BBC.
The former executive director of channel Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should reconsider Rita's mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He noted that it is now only a small part of the material produced by the BBC formally classified as educational - according to him, it is 1% of television content and 0.1% on the radio - and that the company should catch the initiative of the Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "inform, educate and entertain."
On the issues of the partnership Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in such areas as "Proms" (only part of them, he says, is shown on TV), as well as alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to control the brain cells using sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction of the movement at the moment when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists put the worms with genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled by using ispuls sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change the direction of the movement when they affect sound impulses, too high to the human ear can hear.
Impulses influenced by activating neurons, genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Still on the topic: Researchers manage brain activity with the help of light
Scientists said that the worms are demonstrating the possibilities of a new technique called "sonogenetics", the essence of which is to use ultrasound to initiate certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, the ultrasound source is located outside of the body.
Historical Analysis Chalasaṃuti, a researcher at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure, in which a person is sent electrical impulses in the brain and that is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Worms nematodes usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasanya discovered that they started to react when they were placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
He discovered that the bubbles reinforce ultrasonic waves that penetrate into the body of the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect structures called "ion channels TRP-4" found in the membranes of cells of worms.
Ultrasonic waves make these ion channels open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create the nematodes that can be controlled through ultrasound, Chalasanya made genetic modifications of worms, so their motor neurons used ion channels TRP-4.
During the use of ultrasound to influence the modified organisms sound waves reinforced microscopic bubbles and put into organisms worms, activating the modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that used in the "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to activate neurons using light pulses.
Chalasaṃa claims compared to this methodology sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the target area of the brain by fiber optics, low-frequency ultrasound waves freely pass through the body's tissue, so to deliver them does not need to pass inside cranial boxes.
"We believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound signals," said Chalasaṃa.
He added that, in addition to this, the technique can be applied to muscular and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements bullied over the British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International with a protest against the arms exhibition.
Amazing killer drones!
Destroying tibia iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light noise batons, causing unbearable pain but left no trace.
Cheerful voice and paint animation leave no doubt that this advertisement is the largest international exhibition of arms - caustic parody prepared by Amnesty International in order to attract the attention of the British government's intention to "push" weapons to repressive regimes using the gym. exhibition held at the ExCel center in defense technologies and security systems.
Still on the topic: DSEI arms exhibition: authoritarian regimes go to London
But the special campaign also leads to a sudden emergence of many posters at bus stops and metro trains that need to look at them again.
"An important announcement, along the lines of the DLR from September 15 to 18?" - written on one of these fonts of the London Underground with the image of the DLR line into a silhouette of the tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms traffickers will attend the DLR line passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition weapons.
300 posters painted by artists who exhibited his works in the "cruel design museum" Banksy "Dismaland" in the park.
The team called the group "a special patrol" helped to distribute them in London, using "a set of cracker advertising spots", 6-funtovyi set wrench, which, as claimed, "gives access to around a third of advertising space on the bus stops on the planet".
London's transportation boom from such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parodic announcements produced by a group of "special patrol."
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and strive to convey political art to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists begin to work with activists protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against an arms exhibition, passengers in the Metro.
Video from amnesty has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created the agency VCCP, working pro bono, attracting graphic designer and artist sounding, also working for free.
Creative director of VCCP Matt lever was struck by the silence of the advertising arms around the exhibition - with a pass in the Excel calendar - and thought: "Let them campaign that they are trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and ingenious corporate advertising, but "to fill her house with bright colors and animation turned out to be more exciting occupation."
"They are incredibly helped us attract attention to the selling of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis of the amnesty.
Now we need the UK government to take measures and ensure that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold directly at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art exhibition on the theme of weapons goes from inside the ExCel, where participants traded fantastic euphemestically products.
In a press release, the Saab disclosed information about the order "AT4CS RS for firing off" from the U.S. Army.
It includes "has no analogues cumulative warhead which brings unmatched JS-2's action inside the goal."
Whatever he did, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules of living in student dormitories
Already it had been 11 years since I moved in a student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old man, still believe in berets and moral relativism, but only now I recall a strained smile who irritates me - and numerous, long complaints on others.
Basically what I learned, can be put on eight simple rules.
Moving into the dormitory may vary slightly from acting on the nerves to absolutely terrifying.
He encourages chatting: to tell people where you are, whether you're an academic vacation and where he spent, do you support Corbyn and why are you "honestly, neither love nor hate" Marmit "because, seriously, guys, this is simply a yeast extract, hahaha, I was myself".
Take.
And help others to take a break, too, asking questions and interest.
This supports the conversation and helps you find people who you like, but not those with whom you would not even talk, even if you burn eyelashes, and they would give fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People often turn into room drinking establishments, wee-hours cinemas and places of public gatherings, but they are also a place where people dress up and improve their underwear.
Still on the topic: Don't even think to start studying at the university, being in relationships
The introvert in universities include unfair.
Your room should be a refuge, but many hostels are shaping the culture of twists from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long friendship.
This can be hell for anyone who is trying to regain strength.
Nothing in the culture does not allow you to say: "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I was able to restore the energy that I have spent talking with you".
Try to feel when the population tired of communication - and not knocking him, and send SMS messages.
By the way, about the rattling: do it.
One guy in my dormitory followed such a principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He had seen something.
Make friends with the help of pastries.
Because you start university life at the height of the show's popularity Bake Off, knocking on the door for people to introduce yourself and a plate of chocolate biscuits, is not such a strange effect, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "welcome to our neighbors, I can give you something baked, and now smile, and I will ask you personal questions".
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk with you, and eventually, probably, your face will be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how you are a good baker.
Poorly doughy lumps of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to cause people to pretend to be asleep when you will be knocking them.
Stealing food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, assigning someone's chicken - theft, but isn't this theft - take a little bit of milk for tea?
Inquire the owner of milk.
Most likely he will offer you not ashamed, even if the inside is seething with anger.
If someone steals your things, it is annoying, and I feel sorry for you - but try to treat it than my neighbor, who poured into its liquid milk for washing dishes to avenge those who took him without demand.
She is now in prison.
You should not produce noise that will disturb people to sleep or learn.
Not just to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the saying about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked a neighbor to subtract the sound of the drum and bass guitar, as it was 3 o'clock in the morning, and she had the exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor has increased the volume.
When he finally stopped at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours, and then pump up their music and bolted the door, went on a three-hour exam.
Lee was not romantic, if your future spouse settled in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, there would not be this extremely, before biting elbows, awkwardly, if you take a neighbor for his future wife, was fond of them, had broken relationships and would see him every day, and watch how he might drag on his side of all of your friends in common?
Of course, the heart is not ordered - but if a neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool slightly own fervor.
The exciting moment when you realise that someone left the keys inside their locked room, the line between drawing and McCarthyite thinner than it seems.
A good draw is fun, but turns into its opposite in seconds.
Taught valuable and interesting lesson for security by hiding something - but never gave some room toothpaste and shampoo.
Another locked door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but other things are not glued to the ceiling glue Blu waiting more than two times.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system for the iPhone after issuing an update from Apple
The new operating system can be requested by logging into the application settings, select General and then "Software Update."
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install.
Some have faced problems after installing when you receive an error message, telling them that "the update failed application."
To avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait until recovery does not subside, or try to upgrade through iTunes.
Hints on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may include removing applications to increase free space - but Apple to minimize the likelihood of this effect reduces the size of the upgrade, and also facilitate the execution of using a special tool that offers to remove and reinstall them again after the completion of the process.
You should ensure that when upgrading your phone charged or is located next to the charger to prevent your battery.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, because dispelling the phone in the process can lead to an upgrade.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity telephone call.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support that Moscow supports President Assad, leads only to exacerbate the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about it with Russian counterpart, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
The publication of PJ Media reports.
"Secretary Kerry made clear that further support for President Assad by Russia creates the risk of escalation and prolonging the conflict, as well as having a negative impact on our common goal - the fight against extremism," if we do not continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through the immediate transfer of power, "said representatives of the U.S. State Department.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the U.S. commitment to the fight against the "Islamic State" as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be able to be a member.
In addition, the United States "will welcome the constructive role of Russia in an attempt to counter the" Islamic State ".
Last Friday, White House officials said they do not know exactly what actions taken by the Russian troops in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, White House press secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a phone call between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin came: "When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will pick up and try to make this call."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime "bad bet."
I remember our conversation with Mr Putin four or five years ago, when I told him it was a mistake that further support of Assad will only worsen the situation.
"But he has not listened to my warnings - and as a result, the situation deteriorated," the US president said.
Imported yachts are exempt from customs duties.
The ministry intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other craft for recreation and sport from paying customs duties and taxes.
Corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free importation were prepared by the ministry on behalf of the government of the Russian Federation.
This "Izvestia" reported the assistant minister of economic development Elena Lashkin.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev following a trip to Crimea requested a number of departments - The Russian Ministry Of Economic Development, Transport, RF, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the ministry of emergency situations, FSB, TCF, Petropavlovsk - prepare proposals to create favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, the experts noted that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - about €200 million annually into the coffers of the European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
Russia's economic development ministry has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "on making changes to the list of imported goods, temporarily with full exemption from customs duties and taxes" to provide full exemption from customs duties and taxes on imported yachts and other floating funds for recreation and sport.
According to the ministry, this will certainly help to create favourable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, "noted Lashkin.
The question was submitted to the subcommittee on customs tariffs, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade government commission on economic development and integration, the meeting which took place in September, and the discussion was also approved by the departments.
As a representative of the ministry noted that the proposed measure for the full exemption when importing is inherently.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommittee in the government of the Russian Federation Ministry of economic development proposals in the Eurasian Economic Commission to discuss with Member States EAES, explained Lashkin.
The list of imported goods that are completely exempt from customs duties and taxes, includes goods necessary to assist foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for use in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, to provide international aid and others among them - service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), instrumentation, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and items for religious ceremonies.
The press service of the Ministry of the Russian Federation "Izvestia" told that prepared a binding resolution on sea port of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provide a simplified procedure for clearance of call and exit the sport of sailing boats, and boats in the sea port.
The ministry instructed captains of sea ports of Crimea to ensure the use of simplified sunset sailing boats, sport and pleasure boats in the sea port and the release of these vessels from the sea port.
The ministry also prepared a draft of the government of the Russian Federation on approving the border area of sea ports of Crimea.
In respect of Yalta and Feodosia orders have already taken, the rest are under negotiation, "the ministry said.
According to the Ministry of Transport, gosnadzor, classification and examination, the holder of the vessels used for non-commercial purposes must implement the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the South of Italy and France, there is a whole industry that involves a large number of people.
In Russia, however, virtually all stands in place.
Our typeface, the only piece of coast where you can operate year-round yachts, is the Black Sea area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiisk, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that extremely strict rules in the area of border service: to go out for a walk on the yacht, you need to make a lot of permits.
Besides, even inside Russia yacht nowhere pit-stop.
Two days later she can go with their fuel and then face the problem of where to take him, "said sales director Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
As for places to store yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special hangars for yachts up to 30 meters yachts are also sent to storage to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that buyers of yachts - rich people, but since the beginning of the crisis, the demand for yachts declined.
The World Bank gave Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The new funding will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the message says.
The director of the World Bank in Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Timono fan said that the reforms of the banking sector will help revive lending in the real economy and will stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank are seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems of fan calls on the government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
The Polish government had previously approved the provision of €100 million loan to Ukraine, "RIA Novosti".
Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgenders.
The public council at the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues will discuss the possibility of creating separate blocks in the colonies for transgenders and transvestites.
About this "Izvestia" told a member of the board of Vladislav mushroom.
In his opinion, depending on the total number of prisoners in Russia, undecided with Paul, in domestic prisons may provide separate cameras, blocks or even (if such criminals will be many) in the future to create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav mushroom stresses that determine the sentence of citizens in such isolated places is possible only after the convicts will take the appropriate medical examination to prove that the offender is a man identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav mushroom is confident that the marginalization of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of prisoners.
According to him, the proposed practice successfully operates abroad: in prison (where the defendants before the court decision) provides separate cameras for transgenders and in correctional facilities - special blocks.
Today it is the only way out when dealing with such criminals.
Clearly they need to isolate, since the presence of transvestites and transgender people in normal cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and the sea of problems for employees of the federal service.
Humiliation entranced by cellmates are guaranteed, "says Vladislav mushroom.
Depending on how large the city, how many criminals with uncertain sex, and calculate where they distribute.
Don't exactly need a separate prison - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there will be many transgender people.
As explained by mushroom in the block may contain 50 or 100 people, and if the specialized corps will be created in Russia alone, then sent to prison inmates, transsexuals will be able to get from any region.
Citizens kept in pre-trial detention at the place of the crime, therefore receiving transvestites or transgenders from other subjects during the investigation and trial are unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice already convicted in a separate colony - yes, "says mushroom.
Recall on the eve of the law enforcement agencies failed to decide on remand - male or female - to determine who was detained for possession of drugs 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), a man with a girlish appearance had not been arrested.
He was released home under subscription.
The news was widely discussed in the media and social networks as a mechanism of transgenders in detention centers and colonies in Russia really is not.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT activist movement (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alexeyev supported the idea of creating special places for sentence transgenders, noting that abroad it is also possible to identify people in the colonies - male or female - depending on their own desires.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as the issue of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals, "Alexeyev said.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be done in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially because their prisons more than transgender people.
While Alexeev doubts that Russia will prove a lot of citizens willing to betray themselves for transsexuals to get into different from the usual colony.
Of course, you can enter a medical examination before placing people in the colonies for transgenders, but everything is not always clear.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners Chelsea Menning looked like a man already in prison, and said he wants to replace the floor, "Alexeyev said.
A person can feel themselves by anyone.
But while some places to serve a sentence for transgenders no, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the safety of such people and understand their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system of distributing transgender criminals in the colony could greatly delay the start of the sentence convicts.
The commission is created is a matter of sexology, psychiatrists conduct lengthy observations, this is not a test, which is based on a precise conclusion.
Today's capabilities of psychiatry is allowed.
Therefore, before potential patients undergo sex change always such expertise - they accurately indicate whether a change of sex with surgical intervention necessary measure, "says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is hard to imagine how this system implemented in relation to the condemned, because such examination takes a month on average.
The doctor, although on the whole idea of creating separate blocks for transgender supported, also doubted that current economic conditions will be expedient to allocate funds for the construction of new facilities, medical examination, "transgenders in Russia units.
It is difficult to calculate, no official statistics, but given that homosexuals in Russia is around 5%, it can be said that transgenders even less, and those who have such a rejection and also commits a crime, not an insignificant amount, "said Lordkipanidze.
Now at the request before the administration of the colony of homosexuals, transgenders and so can get separate conditions.
Mikhail Antipov won the junior world chess championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk junior world chess championship ended up to 20 years.
The ending of the Championship was more than intriguing.
The winner is only in the last round, and became the Russians Mikhail Antipov, managed to catch up with the poles of Jan Krzysztof Dudu, who seems to have confidently walked to the title.
The girls celebrated victory Ukrainian player Natalia Buxa.
The world chess championship, held since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already by the middle distance tournament seemed to lose almost all the intrigue, as a representative of Poland Jan Krzysztof Duda, issued a series of four victories (competitions are held by the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently seized the leadership.
Given that Duda was the favorite of the Championship's rating, and generally considered to be one of the most promising young players, the likelihood that it missed the mined gap, is insignificant.
And even when Duda export-driven and Mikhail Antipov allowed the Russians to reduce the gap to just 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov, to catch up with the leader, to be sure to win in the 13th round.
But even this would not help, Duda his party.
Plus this is the obligation of victory, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary errors.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, then had to wait when his party completed Duda, met with Benjamin's side.
Fortunately for Antipov Polish chessplayer brought confrontation with the Dutchman draw.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 of the 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
But because he was the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District, whose governor Natalia Komarova, traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded the top prize.
But in the competitions of girls intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Vaduz (Ukraine) - to win the title was not enough to lose in the last round, she successfully did.
Thus, the Russian victory by Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Vaduz.
The Russian athlete remained second with a lag of champion at 0.5 points.
VimpelCom is changing the regional structure.
The company combines the Volga and Ural regions into one track of the Volga Ural region, Siberia and The Far East - in the East region.

Igor Artemyev, head of the Federal Antimonopoly Service, said the agency against the indexation by 10% tariff on freight and providing subsidies, as requested by the Russian railways.
At first they wanted to 17% of indexing, now they want 10%, and a multi-billion-dollar subsidies from the budget, "he said."
We say: this is wrong, this is too much, reducing their costs, learn to save, abandon expensive mansions, football teams, their own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has their own, "far more stringent" proposals that are now being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible variant net calculation with Sumeru gold B.V. instead of execution put option on shares for a total amount of $300 million, according to the gold mining company.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay up to $80 million Sumeru (the difference between the price of shares in favor of Sumeru and market quotations) that can be taken from the free cash flow.
The Sumeru have until October 3 to implement an option or require extra payments.
Details of the negotiations in Polymetal does not disclose.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of operational project "Kyzyl" in Kazakhstan.

It is a modern address food assistance to the population and support effective domestic producers.

I would particularly mention that offered grocery cards should not be confused with an echo of the past times of total deficit, card distribution system in which the number of products is rationed.

A good bet for investcredit - 10-13.
Experts estimate that the market for lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January and April of this year fell by 40%.
What do you estimate, the situation today?
After the panic of the end of 2014 - the beginning of 2015 SME lending volumes have decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Lending by 25-30% p.a. was not beneficial to anyone.
Previously, the bank could lay in the increased rate of all its possible problems in the future, from delays to delinquencies, now it is impossible to make: rates and so sky-high.
The current level of business rates on loans to SMEs is uncomfortable.
For a large part of the current level of investment projects is unacceptable from the point of view of their payback.
The level of rates at 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and build them attractive yield.
How do you estimate the demand met entrepreneurs for loans?
After lowering the central bank interest rates, the situation is slightly improved.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to seek loans far less frequently.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects of its development and future revenues.
Today business is one way out: you need to learn to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
You need to more closely monitor the current results, to monitor the movement of cash.
At the same time, the availability of financial resources should use new technology to modernize equipment, to reduce production costs and energy.
All this will ultimately allow companies to make products more competitive and maintain business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the major trends of the SME lending market will be strengthened and will influence its development until the end of 2015?
Will change the interest rate?
The average reduction forecast rates will largely depend on central bank policy, and now the regulator demonstrates a key sequence in the issue of lowering interest rates.
However, the radical decline in the price of loans for SMEs should not wait.
In the current situation, the problem is primarily inflation, which makes the necessary increased interest rates to get real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even with lower rates of central bank
Speaking about the level of delay, traditionally small and medium-sized companies, limited in both opportunities to replenish cash and options for correction of economic behavior will certainly pose a greater risk for creditors.
I would not expect a substantial reduction in the proportion of bad loans.
The main reason is the international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street.
This is the written word Mazda by Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautifully, tersely and at the same time quite difficult for those accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
And the new crossover CX-5, like any other brand model: without prohibitive attractive outside, technically perfect inside.
The Japanese already simply by virtue of his "japanskosti" can bring the country's attachment to the products of the rising sun to a state of complete delight.
You can bring as many arguments in favor of machines from other countries, and even in principle with these arguments will agree, but the whole conversation went from the final phrase: "But this is the same Japanese car!
And don't argue about anything!
Such people will probably have to love not only technique, but also all other Japanese.
To quote from the bass, spiced food wasabi, collect Katana and wearing his girlfriend - no, not in the kimono, of course, and on the canons of Japanese street fashion: cute, creative and quite unexpectedly.
Perhaps, the Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls wear with pleasure and after graduation.
She has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the girl is older, the skirt is shorter.
The main change in appearance CX-5 - the radiator grille with five horizontal lines.
But it is much harder to change the shape of the new drawing car headlights and rear lights that car immediately recognizable in the flow of machines.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
Silhouette harmonious, sensual forms, but the appearance has a plaque rigor.
Won't have to call the police.
Behind the wheel CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can experience a stoic Japanese calm.
The volume of 2.2 litre diesel engine provides high torque in a wide range of speeds.
The fuel consumption of this engine capacity of 175 L. S. - only 5.9 L. power unit completed exclusively with automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.
Black boots, black cloak, black bag ...
To add to this image a bit of black humor, you can choose leggings with print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, the Mazda made every effort to get behind the wheel of the CX-5 you will not find themselves on their own accidents.
To further enhance the comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension has overhauled the design of the front and rear shock absorbers, and optimized the shape of bushings front lower leverage.
Drive system is fully adapted to Russian conditions.
The level of noise from the road and the engine at high speeds reduced by 13%.
Flower in swimsuit or stripes is as dull as the budget sedan.
Another thing, if the girl paraded in the swimsuit with the original pattern.
For example, from computer game action role-playing genre.
Then she will get no less attention than the new CX-5.
The new CX-5 improved design of both the front and rear seats, which provides an optimal supply of space and broad shoulders and long legs - who possesses.
Another long-legged certainly will appreciate the stoppers in front of the central tunnel now soft and hit the ankles in the runnings.
The widest set of active safety systems are offered precisely on the Mazda CX-5.
In order to recognize the potential threat, it uses radars, lasers and cameras.
There is also adaptive lighting, and warning about the vanishing from the strip, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 is one of the best in the classroom.
Convenient with a minimum of ledges, it contains a cargo volume of 561 L. 4:2:4 proportions in the rear seat - with each section is equipped with a separate remote lever - and increase the load to 1560 L.

Kiev broke the atomic.
Kiev officially issued the refusal of Ukraine from cooperation with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday with the second attempt still voted to cancel the agreement with Moscow.
The agreement on completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed back in 2010-2012, but started the project failed.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted the law, signed in 2010-2012 terminated an agreement with Russia for the construction of the third and fourth block at the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The country's government introduced a bill succeeded only with the second vote, for the first time it supported 210 deputies with the required minimum of 226, but then came with 234 members of parliament voted for the project.
The USSR Khmelnytskyi Nuclear power plant on the original project should be four units per 1 GW with VVER reactors, but managed to build only two.
Negotiations with Moscow on the expansion led by 2010 to conclude the intergovernmental agreement, in 2011-2012 is pleased to accept the relevant laws.
Because there was no money in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the building blocks will have to credit on the Russian side, but the funds have not been allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the ensuing cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to expand relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, refused to cooperate on the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel plant construction project in Ukraine.
The only area where relations have been preserved, remained in fuel purchases for the existing Ukrainian nuclear power plant (provide about half of the electricity generation in the country) as long as the Ukrainian nuclear-power generating "there is nothing to replace Russian supplies.
From the completion of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant plans with other contractors in Ukraine until finally refused: still in 2014 in Kiev stated talks with the Czech Skoda JS.

Parties distributed mandates.
Yesterday the Electoral Commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections in the City Duma district, distributed 12 seats, cast on party lists.
Traditionally many complaints of irregularities during the elections came from representatives of the Communist Party, accused the election commission "concealment of fraud".
The opposition's remarks were not taken.
At the same time Russia's election commission rejected the party of "communists" in the organization of a referendum on the abolition of the fee for overhaul of apartment buildings.
The municipal election commission officially presented the results of the elections in the city of Nizhny Novgorod on the municipal electoral district.
Of all the lists of voters in Nizhny Novgorod was 1.03 million, ballots in commissions issued 746,7 thousand and 268 thousand voters voted in elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were considered invalid, and 24 are lost.
Yesterday 12 mandates were distributed among political parties, depending on the votes they received.
On the list of "United Russia" six seats in the city rely Dmitry Svatkovskiy, Dmitry Krasnov, Vassily Supranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko Vyacheslav Rasteryayev and Igor Nagorno.
The only mandate received the LDPR party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Two of the mandate of the CPRF distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and deputy of the State Duma Alexander Tarnaev.
Three of the mandate of "Fair Russia" Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugina.
Now within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will work with deputies in the City Duma: in the case of refusal from the mandate he goes to the next candidate on the party lists.
The chairman of horizbircom Alexander Makeyev told members of the Commission that introduces duty to "send telegrams of Zhirinovsky and other" on the subject of mandates.
With the approval of the Protocol on the results of the elections, representatives of the Communist Party announced multiple violations.
A member of the horizbircom with the advisory from the Communist Party Leonid Krasnokutsky suggested not to recognize the results of the vote in four districts №21-24, ordered by the head of the district administration Sormovo entrance was closed in the administration building, where the four District Commission.
Inside long could not pass either UDMA deputies, neither the candidates nor the observers and resonant scandal on the storm door Vasylysa was shown on TV.
At meetings of the district commissions all observers and members of the Commission with the advisory vote had the opportunity to attend.
The chapter stopped access to them only when the voting ended and have not yet come to the election commission to take their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent different provocations.
"Then the chapter corrected, and all interested parties to attend meetings," retorted Gore, a member of the electoral commission Natalia Andryushina.
The Communists objected that the administration's building block in more than four hours of illegally detained MP Zac meeting of Ludmila Aristov, over which the investigative committee sent a statement.
The opposition also complained that in a number of polling stations on election day began to sealed ballot boxes at 6-7 hours in the morning, they put in a ballot for early voting.
The members of the Commission with the advisory and observers no one notified, so they already come to the beginning of the election at 8 in the morning.
Communists are confident that in the morning hours before the opening of polling stations in the ballot boxes could unsparingly foist ballots.
However, the mountains have already seen more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makeeva, any violations with the stuffing of unaccounted-for ballots not found.
The proposal was not supported by the members of the Commission and his colleagues from "fair Russia" Maria Popova through oblizbircom out regional legislation amended to clearly establish the envelopes with early voting ballots, which will then go to the ballot box.
"In the order of their own initiative to address the CEC," advised Ms. Popova Alexander Makeyev.
At the end of the meeting on the chairman of the Communist party with loud accusations struck member Sergei Samokhin, screamed that the Electoral Commission ignores dozens of complaints and covers fraud in the elections.
"You're not here at the rally, gently stated!" - offended the chairman of the electoral commission.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
Before the September 27 election commission must approve the general election results, and then for three weeks will be appointed the first meeting of the city council of Nizhny Novgorod sixth.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the city election commission denied a political party "Communists of Russia" in the registration of the initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the teams were going to carry on the discussion of Nizhnivites two questions: whether they agree with the fact that the fees for the overhaul of apartment buildings should be "immediately cancel" and tariffs on housing and public services "to freeze up to 2020."
However, the lawyer of the Duma Irina Maslova clarified that the appeal of "Communists of Russia" is contrary to the legislation.
FedEx is mixed, declining revenue forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported disappointing results of the last quarter, and giant delivery service reduced annual profit forecast due to falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its land transport unit.
The company also said it plans to employ approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that 50,000 temporary workers hired for the holidays.
Its shares fell by about 2.5 percent at the previous auction in 45 minutes before the opening of the stock exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, up 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $ modulation according to FactSet survey.
The decline forecast is observed despite the rise of rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will enter into force on January 4, and increase fees for land transport of heavy or cargo shipping, which begins in November.
The company said it still expects revenue growth compared to last year due to reduced spending, raising gross income and growth of online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "worked consistently given the weak, compared with the forecast, economic conditions, especially in the production and global trade".
Labor recruitment plans were announced on holidays for the next day after a competitor's statement, UPS, that they plan to hire an additional 95 000 employees, roughly the same number as took on the job last year.
For the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than a year earlier.
Earnings per share amounted to $3.81, close to the average forecast of $2.44 per share by Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5%, to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks anticipated 12,23 billion dollars.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a downturn in the sector of urgent international transportation, leading to a lack of growth of gross income in its express transportation.
However, the boom in online shopping has improved results in the FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from land transport increased by 29 per cent, but operating income remained largely unchanged because of increased costs for major departures and self-insurance.
Express Transportation Division received higher income due to higher base rates, whereas in the freight sector revenue fell because of higher labor costs.
The preliminary auction for about an hour before the opening of the stock exchange FedEx fell $3,85 or 2.5 per cent - to $150,15.
They closed Tuesday, down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of 11 June.
The most anticipated for several years, meeting the leaders of the Federal Reserve system will spend two days this week for 27-futovyi table from Honduran mahogany, deciding whether to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of the ornate meeting room at the height of two floors above them will be hanging wall image of the United States.
This card is a reminder that the chairman of the Federal Reserve Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The central bank received a dual mandate from Congress: to increase employment in the US and keep it stable prices.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the federal system acknowledged that there is a third, nenapisan assignment: financial stability.
This is the third assignment may prove to be an unknown factor in almost misjudged decision, which was announced on Thursday, about whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most data show strong growth, recent turmoil in global financial markets could hold the already cautious leaders of the federal system from adding volatility by raising the base federal funds rate - even just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labor market and inflation will become the first and the most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Piegs, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, increased uncertainty around the world market enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus about what to do in the Federal Reserve system, which itself provokes the fluctuations in the financial market.
Roughly half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, recently predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect that from the federal system, with the key indicator shows only about a 30 percent chance of a rapid rise.
This may lead to a fall in the stock market if the Fed will raise rates, provided that those who make decisions will not soften the blow with the promise that the next increase will be delayed.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones rose 228,89 points, or 1.4 percent, to 16 599,85.
The rise was driven by expectations that individuals that define the strategy of the federal system will leave rates this week, "said John Lonski, chief economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research group.
"It will be a surprise if the federal system would raise rates at this point of time," he said.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve system, "they will have to do so far in the approval of its strategy to keep financial markets in the hands so they are not panicking".
Other experts argue that raising rates could reassure financial markets because it removed the uncertainty about how the federal system will operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system seems inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first small steps in slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer, that it expects to raise rates this year, despite complaints from liberals that needs more economic progress.
Although the emergence of new jobs in August slowed, growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and almost at the level that the federal system consider full employment.
Wage growth shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank's target rate of 2%, the leadership of the federal system said that a key reason for a temporary effect of the sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, taking into account the reduction of the labor market," said Ian Schäferdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index companies fell as much as 16 percent to a record high in May, as investors feared that the slowdown of the Chinese economy could slow global growth.
The market partly restored its position this month, and the Dow is now about 10% below the high in value.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve system resentment of the market further complicates the difficult calculations of raising interest rates.
"In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks they would become the screws at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and a former member of the Federal Reserve system.
Now, he predicted, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
"There is great uncertainty in what might prove to be the consequences for the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data after recent events in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not included in the main concern of the federal system, and technically it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.
But essentially the Federal Reserve has become a global financial power.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
Only one hint from then Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "stifle" its monetary expansion, caused shocks markets worldwide.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined with each other, one would expect that the leaders of the Federal Reserve system will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also to consult with representatives of other central banks and with experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process - "more art than science," said Zachary Karabella, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey laquer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve system were cases of excessive reaction to the movements of the financial market that seem to be related to economic principles."
Laquer, an influential voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, insisted on raising rates, as an example of the decision led 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia has led to a federal system lowered its base rate by 0.75% in the three sessions, "despite limited identifiable consequences for growth in the US," said laquer.
A year later, the leaders of the federal system abolished these reduction.
The Federal Reserve should raise concern about stability in the first place only during major crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008, "said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the committee for setting interest rates at the Bank of England.
The last panic and not very close to that level, he said.
"You would certainly not want to be in a situation where you scares growth rates because the markets are experiencing shock," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be ahead of the event.

State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin admits that the United States deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East to the waves of refugees pouring into Europe.
According to Interfax, he told journalists in Ulaanbaatar within the framework of the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE.
"I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question itself: whether it is Europe that is not the ultimate goal of those with such manic persistence in recent years to destabilize the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?" - asked him questions.
"It is certainly someone assumed and knew that the streams of refugees, the poor and disadvantaged people who are fleeing death, rushing into prosperous EU countries," he added.
Naryshkin asked: "How many political leaders of Europe spoke openly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees who are now literally engulfing their country?".
"There is no old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent," he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO violates many European values and norms of international law.

Government troops and militias loyal to them confront the insurgents, consisting mostly of Islamists.
Later to the opponents of the Syrian government banned in Russia joined the terrorist group "Islamic State".
The United States supports the rebels who oppose both Assad and is.
The official Damascus considers such insurgents terrorists.
The president of Syria called the cause of animosity of the West to Russia.
Claims of the West to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran, is actually that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by the Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, Russia's first channel, "24," NTV, "Russia today", TASS, "Interfax" and "Russian newspaper".
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would remove one person and put in his place of another, who will act in the interests of Western countries, not in the interests of his homeland, he noted.

The Brazilian Association of Pediatricians Rio Grande promotes a healthy nutrition for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRs invented a controversial method by which to persuade women to need nutritious food while breastfeeding: the method involves showing images of babies sucking chest painted images of unhealthy food.
The composition of breast milk includes a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates from which children get all the nutrients they need for the formation of a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs pregnant and gave birth to women is recommended to increase the daily rate of calories by about 500 calories per day.

Unfortunately, the negative effects of unhealthy nutrition were identified on the child's immune system.

Now the AMA recommends not engage in this sport, and better, from her point of view, he banned at all.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally, "said Stephen Pernis vice president of the organization."

Recall the autumn session Of The Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulan Bator and will last until September 18.
Victory round a couple of days.
World athletics champion Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumphant for 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergey Shubenkov.
He managed his crown at a distance of 110 metres hurdles win at the European Championship team, set several records, but the main thing is to become a world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the "Diamond League" took third place in the overall standings.
"New Izvestia" asked Shubenkov to share their impressions of the outgoing season.
Sergei, the season is not finished for you?
Yes, I am going to perform at the World Military Games, which will be held October in Korea, and then I will think about the rest.
However, to prepare now at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still quite another state.
Everything is easier than every week - around the world.
You once said that autumn is the favourite time of the year for you.
At the end of August, the beginning of September is a wonderful time.
Passions after the start of the season otkipated, the responsibility is not pressed.
It is possible to compete in the pleasure, "rasslabon."
Plus you know that and leave very soon ...
And there is fatigue?
The special season, a lot of positive emotions.
Fatigue by the end of the season always accumulates.
And it doesn't matter what he did more - win or lose.
Every competition is a stress.
Constant flights, transfers - all this does not pass for the body completely.
Tired physically and emotionally.
But now the emotions I have, of course, on the rise.
Yes what is there - I'm just happy.
By the time when the finished at the World Championships in Beijing, returning frequently?
It happens.
Yes and you, journalists, don't let me forget about it.
But generally I think the bad athlete who live with old victories, scrolled their successful races again and again.
Victory round a couple of days - and you have to move on. "
Preparation for this remarkable season is different from the usual?
I can't say that there was something special.
We started to prepare themselves back in December, but I missed the competitive winter season.
First trained at home in Barnaul, then at the training camp, then again at home.
Everything is as usual.
But with the coach put the task: to try to reach a new level on which I have not yet been.
Practically all winter time spent to lay the base.
The pile of Cross made exercises on obshchephysically training included and cravings, and squat, and we back up.
Then the barrier began training, many were engaged in technique.
How are rivals, watched?
I always try to do good in the age of the internet with no problems.
Looked the Winter Championship of Europe, and there in the sprint barrier pedestal occupied the French!
Another thought: we need something to do with the company.
With every start this season and you add to the results.
This will give confidence?
I have formed the last season at roughly the same scheme.
There is no such that I run first and then - 14,20 13.50.
Always retraced its shape gradually.
The main thing they wanted to do is run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was directed primarily on this result.
But the paradox is that kind of feel ready for the feats and competitions to show their readiness is not always.
As it was, for example, at the Olympic Games in London?
I have to be honest, the semi-final race (Shubenkov failed to qualify for the final. "" No ") to try to forget immediately.
It was very well prepared, really could run out of 13 seconds.
Yes even if he repeated his best result at that time, would become the bronze medal games.
But not lucky.
Remember his first world championship?
And what?
In Daegu this was.
I then wanted to climb in the final, was such a program.
And directly with utrec in the preliminary race.
Then I realized that tear and rush headlong - it means not going anywhere at all.
After two years at the World Championships in Moscow has already reached the final with the best time.
Well remember their feelings before the decisive race: I wanted to then win "gold"!
How do you manage to develop a decent speed, not to lose his head back and not disconnect?
But this is the most difficult.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technique not to knock down barriers.
I noticed that when the result is not, and in the process so much easier.
And the most buzz when you have the feeling that everything like itself turns out!
Honestly, it is worth it.
Many of our athletes from the backwoods after the first serious successes are seeking to move closer to the capital.
Never had such thoughts?
The house is still better.
Yes and I have no idea where I am without my coach to whom I need?
Maybe it would be good to have a better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
C Klevtsov you have together?
With 12 years since has come in athletics.
More precisely, I initially trained at his wife, who worked with children, and then she gave me.
I started with the sprint, then in the long jump, triple.
Children's all-around was when the metal ball, long jump ...
In 14 try running hurdles, and I liked it.
From the first race turned out a second adult discharge.
And remained.
Fear of barriers has never been?
Somehow immediately turned out to agree with them.
But the technique has always had to work very much.
Won over one overclocking how many tormented!
But from this routine is nowhere to run.
The technique should be honing constantly - that night I could be waking up, I immediately got up and ran through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing, claiming that it was a beautiful running.
Thank you.
I myself liked it.
I usually do not re-examine their races, but I could not resist.
But the efficiency needs to continue to work - there is no limits to perfection.
Not afraid now that the victory for a year before the Olympic Games will fall on the shoulders of the heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, will try to justify expectations.
Once chose this road, it must go to the end.
My coach loves to repeat: if you're not a wimp, no additional cargo should not feel.
And I absolutely agree with him.
Otar Kushanashvilli
Well, I am not so naive to me embarrassing reaction to the interview what happened in Ukraine.
People are resentful, I understand, their bread don't feed - give, tossing enemy.
And although I am not wrapped in the flag, and the same, exactly the same, a million times spoke directly bastards here, and no one called me, "another hit.
All my pseudodrug just seconds somewhere disappeared.
Pressure that I have been so strong that even I, a nice lad, I think the people of Belene ".
If he walked himself, walked, and you were attacked a crowd and a bunch of rods.
But you know me, I'm not the eagle room, my fist, I'm from howitzers gaff, old guys, I'm afraid.
Another thing - no support.
I have, and so there were no illusions but now ...
Self-sufficiency was always the best in me, so vykusyvayut.
And to give passports to such freaks like Fred Durst or Monson, can only morons.
Better for me, a better journalist, nested work.
A week ago in Kiev Otar "in sharp form characterized the Crimean events:
What committed with the Crimean peninsula - a crime.
It is precisely such and called the annexation.
I believe that the reference to how tipsy Khrushchev something tried to sign, in no time does not fit into the overall picture of the human hostel.
This is like to come to a neighbor and pick up his first ...
The war went from the Kremlin, and it will end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, as in the summer of 2008, she started with a call of some bastards from the Kremlin.
I have the assumptions of who it could be.
Kobzon is not so much to live there.
I do not understand, he is the greatest artist, why would he need to lick the hands of Putin.
What, he will lose the apartment?
Well, demolished the monument to him.
Of course, people remembered him as it offends their small homeland.
And reconciliation is now only from Vladimir Vladimirovich depends.

On the eve of the White House Press Secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia isolation if it does not stop supporting Assad.
Alternatively, Ernest offered to join the international coalition that is conducting anti-terrorist operation against the "Islamic State".

The head of the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russian soldiers for many years are in Syria and help Syrians to master the technique to use it against the Islamists.
Four people were killed when the police opened fire with rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police started firing rubber bullets into the crowd, protesting against a proposed new constitution as the official representative said on Wednesday.
The violence happened on Tuesday evening in the District Rupandeja, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
Bishnu Prasad Dakai, head of the district police, said that more than 1,000 protesters gathered at one of the police departments, some throwing stones and petrol bombs.
Mr. Dakai reported that police used tear gas, then fired into the air before being put into the rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It is unclear why the rubber bullets, which are known to be killed, but they are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative to such a high mortality rate.
This clash was the last few weeks of violent protests in the South, the plains of Nepal, where representatives of nationalities madesi said that the new provinces established under the new constitution, reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in the west of Nepal, among the citizens of the nation to Tara, who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
August when four major political parties have signed an agreement on the division of the country into a province that has become a crucial step on the way towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which is centrally governed over the course of several centuries.
Work on the new constitution since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that claimed the lives of thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted for the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter will be signed on Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s of the last century as the center of the chemical industry, has a well-developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.

The city is running the decree of the president of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demographics in the city has not been observed in the last 27 years.
So the question of availability of places in kindergartens today is one of the most pressing.
The overhaul was closed on September 1 at Kindergarten No. 10, calculated for 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repairs - 86 million rubles.
Such means the city still has never received.
Last year, after repairing opened a kindergarten No. 23, which is now visited by 200 children.
Repairs have been made on the conditions of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its value was more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government have provided funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment, helped and the "people's initiative".
There are plans to start in 2016 the construction of a new kindergarten.
With its introduction, we plan to liquidate the sequence of children aged from 18 months to three years.
Queues for children from three to seven years we have not.
Investors are showing interest in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction in the city should do, first of all, Sayan enterprises, it is their need to provide work.

As for construction, adding that Sayansk is one of four cities in the Angara Region, which entered into economy class housing construction program.
All the necessary documentation is prepared.
Construction of the 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
We announced the construction of 10,000 sq m of housing wishing to participate in the program very much.
One of the conditions of housing should be no more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this price includes finishing "turnkey".
If we cope with a specified amount, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
In his time on the territory of Sayan pig, which in 2004 was sold for nothing.
We are working with the prosecutor's office on the deal.
Moreover, the land under the object - the federal property.
Goes to work with Moscow, addressed the issue of the transfer of 88 hectares in the regional property, with the subsequent transfer of land in the municipality.
There is a potential investor, ready to invest in reconstruction and launching project of 1.5 billion rubles.
With the launch of the pig we have 900 jobs, which will be a big help for the city.
The Sayansk developed Institute of Social Partnership?
We have concluded about 140 treaties of social and economic partnership.
A lot of projects have been implemented due to the active social position of business representatives.
Tangible support to render such enterprises as ZAO "Vostok centre", the new Ziminsky CHP, LLC "Sayan broiler" LLC "PC MDF", the management of these companies to respond to the treatment.
Directly to the city day LLC "Sayan broiler" children's town, the city gave the company "East center" to repair the equestrian courtyard, where specialists are engaged with children ipatherapy spent more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsorship funds managed to equip the territory of the city.

Like in the good old days the parade took place with the participation of urban groups and organizations.
The book was released, the Chronicle of the city Sayan poets.
Workers and individuals who have made a serious labor contribution to the development of Sayansk, awarded jubilee medals.
Philanthropists will also participate in the work of the city's charitable fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
For nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles directed to support talented guys, to help children in need of expensive treatment, support for children from low-income families.
How are solved in Sayansk personnel problems in the social sphere?
The city lacks doctors and educators secondary-level.
To address the question of the enormous importance of personnel housing specialists.
Over the past year we have identified five apartments for doctors, housing received four teachers.
We have been working on the allocation of housing program with the possibility to privatize it in five years.
The plans - the redevelopment of the building, which will be built by eight apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors participate in the program "housing for the Russian family".
The perspective - house building for public-sector workers.
The most important thing is that the team would operate in the city with which I can solve the most difficult questions.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region.

Google launches a campaign of doubling donations to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced a doubling of donations intended to collect $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help European countries flood refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had used a personal approach, announcing a campaign to collect donations on his blog.
Instead of a statement made by one of the leaders, Google employee Rita Masood, who fled with his family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described his personal experience.
"We were getting on the dubious trains and buses, suffered hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, many people like my family, desperately need help.
Donations will be transferred to four nonprofit organizations engaged by refugees and migrants: "Doctors without borders", the International Rescue Committee, the organization Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that it would double its first donation of $5.5 million, while the amount in page google.com/refugeerelief will not reach 11 million dollars.
Europe faces a refugee crisis since the second world war, caused by much of the four-year civil war in Syria, which this year moved more than 4 million people.
Many also fled from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with small obesity can help obesity surgery
A favorable effect after obesity surgery in people with obesity, type 2 diabetes, may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetics with a small live longer after obesity surgery for obesity than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality statistics is not immediately," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, wrote an editor's column about a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the sense of hunger and restrict the ability of organis absorb food.
For several years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the basic research was carried out among people with morbid obesity, having a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal at value from 18.5 to 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or above indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1d0zqdv.
For the new study, researchers from the Taiwan hospital min Sheng general used data collected since 2007, to compare two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, with the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with obesity.
The average BMI of those who have undergone surgery, fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, the BMI of those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes, remains roughly at the level of 29.
Among those who had surgery, completely cured of diabetes by 36%, and partially - 28%.
In the group that received medical treatment, for comparison, a complete cure for diabetes was observed only 1%, and partial - only about 2%.
In addition, indicators of blood pressure, high triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "as a whole were better in the surgical group," the authors said.
The researchers also controlled the A1s hemoglobin levels in the blood, which reflect the blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c test is better to keep below 7 percent, "the researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1C test decreased from roughly 9% to approximately 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it has remained stable, at around 8%.
But the best indicators of glycemic control, reflecting good levels of hemoglobin A1C test, not reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to the study by Dr. Su Chi Cheng and colleagues.
The research team also compare the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared with the group, Polc sleeve gastrectomy, shunt group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1s (3.1% versus 2.1%), and was closer to a complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the advantages of surgical methods in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is confirmation of the results of the study of people with excess body weight in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to increased life expectancy, according to Blackstone from the University College of Medicine in Phoenix, Arizona.
According to the Swedish research for people with obesity, bariatric intervention, the likelihood of dying for 15 years was approximately 29% lower compared with the group, which uses a more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone said it is encouraging people with a BMI below 35, interested in such a procedure.
"This report is very important because it argued that such surgery is safe in the group with a low BMI, where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to seriously treat weight as soon as the patient's BMI range between 27 and 30.
"I think we have to wait too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate genetic changes that run in their bodies, obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to turn back.
In Mytishchi robbers made from the fur house and 9 million rubles.
In Mytishchi robbers attacked residents of Moscow house and stolen from them 9 million rubles and three female coats.
It informs "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unidentified men entered the house through an open front door, located on Gorky Street, the 20-year-old son of the mistress of the house and tied, threatening both knife, abducted 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damages amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, initiated criminal proceedings under article "robbery".
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotel have the right to place the tourists who come to see the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
The rest of the hotels are in no hurry to get an appropriate resolution.
According to experts, this is a very worrying sign.
In the run-up to the world championship, the authorities urgently have to invent ways to resettle all guests of the city.
Interlocutors "Rosbalt" believe the tournament due to the cost of renting apartments will grow by 10-30%, and after the championship for buyers will have to pay.
FIFA World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
Under the law, written specifically for primacy, each hotel St. Petersburg must undergo the classification process and prove that corresponds to the number of stars and the level of service.
Now it is clear that not everyone could do it: hoteliers are so wary of inspections that often did not even send the documents at the request of the Federal Antimonopoly Service in St. Petersburg.
President Vladimir Putin told Vadim Vladimirov, the agency examined 138 hotels and now plans to get 34 cases against hotels, many of which are simply not answered Antimonopolists.
There are signs that the leadership of the three dozen companies duped citizens by placing a number of stars in advertising, said Vladimirov.
The problem is that the account is now literally every room, no one should lose before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the Football Championship fans will occupy all Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city, tourists can expect 30.5 thousand numbers.
According to the Smolny, in Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotel, 100 - two - and three-star, 550 - one-star.
According to the first deputy Of Guicion tourism development committee, currently classification passed only 23 hotels - so many inspections conducted accredited companies in St. Petersburg.
But whether a similar procedure at some regional enterprises, Smolny by an amazing coincidence is unknown.
That is the classification may be more, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months was not sought to pass the classification," acknowledged the director of the Northwest branch of the Russian Union of Tourism Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn more money and don't want to do other things.
Another reason - budgets that were not laid down expenses for verification, the procedure can cost the hotel depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
Yet lately, managers of hotels intensified and began to submit applications for classification, assured Shadskaya.
Hotels need to catch up to July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay the fine, but still did not get the right to work in the world championship.
Already known that depending on Starship will be developed a fixed fee for a room at the hotel at the time of the tournament.
The formula, which calculated the cost will be released next year.
This is done to prevent price hikes for 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg economic forum.
You need to have a conscience and not to allow increased two to three times, but hotels need to give money.
"I think the growth will be up to 50 percent," said the president of the Russian Hotel Association Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov not sure that price fixation corresponds to an understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how this fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It is better for unrestrained appreciation," he said.
It is not clear what will happen with popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the State Duma introduced the bill, according to which the hostels should be banned in residential homes.
We hope that the law will not be accepted or will not be affected Petersburg.
"We will defend a point of view that hostels must be preserved," says Nana Guachie.
However, she said, the owners of the hotels in any case should be prepared to tightening housing code.
If the Duma has passed a bill, then closes approximately 80% of hostels in St. Petersburg, and at the moment there were 1.5 thousand rooms.
According to the president of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers of north-west Leonid Garbar in St. Petersburg lacks two - and three-star hotels, which are used by football fans, but there is a bias towards hotels with four and five stars.
Such a situation similar to the situation where "at 80-tyshyachny stadium sitting 75 thousand marks."
This can be corrected just by the hotels.
Their possible ban expert considers "idiocy": "It seems odd that some people can live in apartments, but visitors somehow cannot."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that it is wrong.
But if the hotel where guests come for a short period of time, then why not?
Mini hotels risk to miss the World Cup and because of its instead.
Hundreds of small hotels simply did not manage to pass the classification, and digging a hole for themselves.
By the summer of 2016 book works will be all hotels in the city.
"Companies that can hold this procedure not so much, so they will refuse to pay less orders from mini hotels, and will choose those that expensive," said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities such as Moscow and Volgograd, indicators tested at the moment is significantly higher in St. Petersburg.
The reason Petersburg delays associated with constant permutations in the tourist block of the government that does not promote harmonious work.
According to the experts, if Petersburg hotels are not enough that most likely will have to pay attention to the regional hotels and holiday homes.
For example, to celebrate the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg in the city can mobilize the River Fleet, guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans "will come on the vans in which it will be possible to spend the night.
"The main thing is not to set up as many hotels, so they were unoccupied," sure Gennady Lamshin.
Also great popularity during the football championship will use removable housing.
Most likely the city will create a reserve of removable apartments.
Rental rates will rise by 10-30%.
"From the obvious - the first leaves housing near the stadium," said the agency's leasing specialist development and real estate research Larisa Braguin.
And the lease price may not return to previous levels after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will facilitate the construction of new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she said.
We should not forget about the human qualities of citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar sure Petersburg has always been a hospitable city where people do not simply tell the road, but could still hold a mini tour.
There are also complications.
My dad of the year in 1970 in the yard met a family from Murmansk - father, mother and two children.
They got nowhere to sleep: it was then difficult, with hotels at the station to sleep hard.
"And dad brought them into our communal apartment to sleep," recalled the interlocutor.
However, he added that such traits in the city residents left - to call home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But perhaps in 2018 after unsuccessful decisions of the State Duma, hoteliers and governments will have to recall past mistakes?
Zhirinovsky "merged".
With admiration now looking at Zhirinovsky's clowning in the State Duma.
He did such things, when our generation is still only learn to sell newspapers, and still is in great shape.
The theme of the speech seems to be - "the LDPR protest against the election results in the Amur region".
The protocols do not shake - for nothing; other protocols, also signed by the Electoral Commission, the LDPR, apparently, no.
He raises the second place of Ivan Abramova and shouting something like: "Here is the winner of the election!"
And nothing immediately lashed out at Rodnina and then, after a skirmish with the chair, diverts faction from the meeting room, literally screaming "you are all with the fronts of your swindlers and thieves".
The press, of course, gives the emphasis not on Abramova, the scandal and the faction demarche as a consequence of this scandal and insults.
Zhirinovsky is really beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole of the country, this is another trick of Zhirinovsky in the style of "scum!", and not a political party to protest against the results of specific elections.
And formally brawled faction, and the election, according to the website of the party and Facebooka Ivan Abramova, is not recognized, but the topic is clearly the leader with tears.
Provides dead in Komsomolsk-on-Amur bury their own dead, and declared himself against the "United Russia" as a whole and not filming Rodnina.
Elegant solution to and not to lose face, and not an ostentatious scandal will not go.
Another thing is that now finds himself in the odd position of Abramov.
In addition to the screams of the bosses he doesn't wait, there is no alternative to the hands of the protocols.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for a narrow circle it became a formal occasion and for insulting a respected champion, and that is even steeper, hurts the EP and NOF.
And here he is, of course, you have to think very seriously what to do.
Because of the main beneficiary of the election, the politics of the region's number 2 and number 1 candidate for the only regional constituencies it can turn into a pariah, who successfully lend their own party leadership and super irritant to the NOF and someone else's leadership of the party.
That's definitely - there would be no Zhirinovsky, it would be to invent and respectfully for him to watch.
Trump still before him to grow and grow.
The news emerged that the LDPR will return to the Hall during the next same plenark.
That means Bath fell with nothing at all.
The only topic Abramov under themselves entombed.
Well really.
"It is not possible that all come to Europe" - The Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the center of compassion to the Dalai Lama at Oxford, dedicated to research ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity must be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this raises admiration, the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate situation.
"This is a neozmozhny to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama spoke highly about the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
"The care of thousands of refugees - fine, but at the same time you have to think about the long-term decisions of how to bring the real world and real development, mainly through education, these Muslim countries," he said.
After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We need to weaken the use of force.
The use of force will never solve these problems, "he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George W. Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying the strong reaction of the US launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed his condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is not through violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and this caused unexpected consequences, "the Dalai Lama said.
A fourfold increase in the number of children who swallow disinfectant for hands, over the last 4 years
Toxicological centers in the United States reported almost 400-procentný increase since 2010, the number of children under 12 years old, swallow an alcohol-based hand with high alcohol content, according to toxicology center of the state of Georgia.
According to Dr ordinal Lopez, director of the Georgia Center for Toxicological, cases of ingesting children up to 12 years of liquids to disinfect hands reported in toxicological centers increased from 2771 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children come into contact with these substances more often, and, unfortunately, some percentage of them sent to the ambulance," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant liquid specifically, and some do it to impress their friends, or on the dispute for social networks.
The videos on YouTube shows how teenagers are drinking liquid disinfectant as cheap liquor.
Reportedly, teenagers mixed with alcohol-containing liquid antiseptic mouthwash to get a drink.
Younger children may attract the pleasant smell of disinfectant liquid.
"The child doesn't think it can hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (disinfectants liquids for hands) - those that are flavored.
There is a liquid disinfectant hand with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant liquid contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Young children, especially, just a few spray can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is a high concentration of alcohol," told Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr Stephen Thornton, chief physician of the toxicological Center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn't leave just a glass of whiskey, but people keep in mind these disinfectants for hands, and if children reach them, this is a quick way to consume a large amount of alcohol.
NAIG Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed school disinfectant hand with strawberry aroma of approximately four sprayed, was sent for treatment in the emergency department.
The level of alcohol in her blood was 179, twice as much as an adult, which by law is considered to be in a state of alcoholic intoxication, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie - an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
NAIG confuses words and could not walk when she was taken to the ambulance.
Doctors observed her all night in a separate children's clinic in order to not miss any signs of brain injury because of the alcohol girl fell and hit his head, told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," told CNN Ortoria Scott, the mother Naigi.
This could well prove fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use nespirtovoy substances or disinfectant wipes, in addition, in order to remove the liquid antiseptic hand out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants fluids associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing toxic disinfectant, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol - a deadly agent, not ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three pupil fourth-graders in the north of New York agreed to poison them "nasty" teacher by "the proliferation of antibacterial substances in the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher had a strong allergy to hand sanitizer, and it is prohibited to keep them in their class.
Police believe that a failed plan was "empty talk" and addressed the issues of discipline school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back benches at the entrance to the regional children's library Krupskaya sad cast-iron owl.
Kids who come for books, trying to feed her sweets.
For several generations goes to the library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the 1920s of the last century staged loud readings, put performances on the poetry of Mayakovsky, a literary quiz and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
Correspondence lasted four years, and, as a young newspaper wrote in 1939 "Stalinists" every day "friendship between Nadezhda Krupskaya and friends of children's library of the city of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda even sent his friends once took a distant baby photo.
And when barnaulets asked whether Nadezhda objected to the library assigned her name, wrote that there is no mind.
Letters for the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain, whose dour profile adorns a bas-relief on the building of the library.
During the years of perestroika often called different people screaming: why children's library is not renamed?
The library may be the name of some good children's writer, without political painting!
Library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as "leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the lobby - a track of yellow bricks.
"The wizard of the Emerald City" is a favorite theme of the artist Oli coal tit.
Previously, Olya was a manager at a law firm, came to work at eight, five, and from all the other managers differed only love for drawing.
And then found the ad on the internet: "Require an illustrator for the book".
A book written by a little American girl, and she called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mother has cancer."
Olya made illustrations, and thought: "life could end at any moment, and no miracles in it will not be, if you do not create them himself.
Now she works in the library, illustrated children's book writers around the world and the tales.
Traditionally considered that children lose interest in the book that they increasingly live in a virtual space ...
But to us, then go read children and their parents understand the importance of reading, "says" Russian planet "library director Tatiana Kushvid.
In recent years, we have even had a moment of confidence that children's library needs, and she will live - kids then go here!
I think the interest in reading is returning.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition tap with updated ”Travel.
Once a quarter, posted new photos of readers who go to the library of the whole family: mother, father and children.
The library rejoice that children are increasingly began to come to the Pope.
If in two years the child read the whole Chukovsky, a young age he needs books.
But now there is a law that eight-year-old prodigies is forbidden to give out books from category 12+.
To get such a book, the child must bring with parents - they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes something like a family club for them.
In the library there are treasures - the prerevolutionary collection of epics with FE and EP, Korolenko story in the magazine "Niva," binder "things" in 1936.
After all, we are now not only conceptual space "Temple books", we are now open to traffic, we tried to become a special place: no house, no job, no school, "explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, draw, play together.
We made a play area for kids - the child comes to just play, and hand still stretches to the book!
Parents take some of our readers, and they faced with legs, don't want to leave.
Often, mothers with strollers come - and we are pleased that the library they put in first place among all the other places where you have to come with kids.
Tatiana Kushvid says: modern children as we once did, like the classic children's literature:
"Publishing is now developing, and much attention is paid to authors who are a link between generations."
And speaking of small children, it is important to have some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to part with their heroes.
Library constantly produces booklets for parents, which tells what is happening in modern children's literature, what books should pay attention to and why.
Booklets are so exciting and intriguing, and adults are interested but this library is not for them.
To bring books beyond the reading room for adults is prohibited.
This magic privilege is only in children.
... In the back room of the library there is a square Luke with ancient wooden staircase into the basement in the room.
Steps will cover under your steps is already very old time machine.
With a book of his childhood, as with an old friend: hello, it is good that we are not changing.
Ellie is still fun to walk on the road paved with yellow brick, Idler S.J. Ryzhikov stealing magic matches, and only Kibalchish and accursed bourguin Military Secrets - he has such a strong word.
Such books - like passwords, you can find them anywhere on their own.
There is a real rarity in the store and bookshelves - for example, the prerevolutionary collection of epics with FE and EP.
Or Korolenko story in the famous magazine "Niva".
Or all "things" in 1936.
The senile pages, painted them in tea color.
These publications readers no longer give out.
This is the shards of our future collections, I dream - retire and do rare children's books.
But children are already, so to speak, not generalising: and paint in old books are not very bright, and themes ... open the first page and there is Lenin, the party, Komsomol.
Now it seems: why do we all have this "Pioneer truth?"
But it was still interesting, "says" Russian planet "Galina Ilyasov, head of time.
The pages of "things" darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna manages the collection of his whole life.
She knows what color cap at the Buratino academic year in which Harry Potter became the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch championship team, in what situations Carlson is using silencers for journalists, and who works the father of Alice Selezneva.
The work of the librarian pay less, and everyone who can live without these bookstores rows, very quickly find themselves another profession.
Only the most cold-hearted: educators, teachers, ministers of the cult books.
They can learn to smile - is thought to be a professional trait of children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation is a professional.
I generally like children's books: as a librarian I like them to precisely and beautifully stood on the shelves, and still I love to read them, "says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.
Read contemporary Russian authors, fresh translations ...
Of course, it seems to me, in my childhood, everything was different.
Books were the most interesting and exciting of all, what happened to me.
And because I love them, I thought that the library is a magical place.
And I wanted to work there, where everyone is sitting and reading.
I hope the book will be always, despite the reader.
And rejoice when our former readers bring children and grandchildren ...

I understand that this is a very vexed, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset with what is going on.
And we, too, but we have to continue.
And we really, really need the support of the "Celtic" because of these players become much better.
Stay together now is so important.
Warburton with distrust waits for January transfers

The former attacker "Brentford" said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window".
As for players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season for their adaptation of what you see in our own group this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more damage is applied by adding unwanted players to those that you really need.
Michu, who is interested in the "Celtic", hinted about the completion of career

Why should I - witness executions in Oklahoma
Today, evaded legal intervention at a later stage, I will watch a man executed.
If this happens, and I hope that they do not, I will sit on the viewing gallery death row prison in Oklahoma, when Richard Glossip was executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
This request was made for the first time in January, through his close friend, and, although I was shocked, I agreed.
With the approach of this day I became afraid.
So why do it?
I agreed because they thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique view.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and as willing to often more than the places, the results of a grim lottery to decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of places for the press reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I will sit with our closest friends, Richard Glossip, and we have our own relationship after several months of phone calls and one visit, which lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when I talk to him.
The prison administration asserts that I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I am not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I will have to try to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter that I am renouncing his impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, get access.
I complained about her.
She acknowledged that she "could better formulate", but still believes that I am wrong in what I do.
Richard Glossip agreed with something from what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he spoke.
I told him that he can remove me from their list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants the journalist of the international edition was there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that the publicity will help the movement for the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from the Huffington Post will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to podcasts, which I recorded.
I won't go into details here once again.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossipnet is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese makes him guilty of aiding crime.
But I believe there is a great possibility that he is not guilty of murder.
I am firmly convinced that the evidence for the death sentence was not enough.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will watch how he will die.
I can't say that I will be completely.
There are other reporters to whom you can apply it.
You will learn from me what it's like to watch a man who I like, without having to die.
Persecuted man persuaded police to get out of the Canning River
Constable from Canning Town Vail managed to persuade the man to get out of the Canning River, and to remain dry.
Perth resident intended to evade police, but failed, stuck in the dirty water in shallow water just metres from a police officer, trying to "gently persuade him to go ashore."
Weill Canning was caused by police on Tuesday on the illegal penetration into foreign territory in Backingham.
When police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them, scurrying in Canning.
But he's not far away.
"He stood in the water and said" I'm not going to go out, let's, catch me, "said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledaina.
Constable Lachlan Perhavets not very much like wetting the form, so he used a safer technique - "negotiations with a good cop".
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledaina.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins exactly this and remembered.
In 2006, cousins moved out into a ditch to avoid an encounter with police patrols to check for alcohol, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but encourage local residents to invent a comic "biathlon Ben Cousins".
Peter Moody accuses stewards attempted espionage and threatens to withdraw from equestrian sports
Peter Moody accused Victoria racing stewards in an attempt to introduce a spy in his stables last year and threatened to immediately leave the equestrian sport.
His target was the ethics of Racing Victoria stewards and department employees, whom he accused of having organized a campaign against him personally, and withdrawal from the start lady Tatai due to violations of the rules on the use of medicines at the start of the day, on Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he will always make every effort to participate in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation when we were talking about the positive result of Lidari's cobalt samples that he cannot explain.
He wanted to keep the language on suspicion of espionage for a year and a half and didn't want it "look like green grapes".
"I'm not going to say anything, and suffered for a long time, but sometimes you are so freaked out that no longer restrained," said Moody.
They know that this continued.
Sometimes react, and then you have to endure the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Today I go home and I will be sleeping tight.
I want to walk with my head held high and want my owners know - I'm doing everything possible for them.
When they start to think that this is not the case, then I will need to stop being a coach.
Then I will have to think about what to do with its license.
The sensational Moody previously said during an interview on Racing.com, the ethics department trying to spy on his stables.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat down in a room with a man that I call, if asked, and offered him a job in my stables to transmit information about what I am doing in the stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They clearly believe that I am a criminal.
If so, they all certainly should apply, because I was trying to catch them.
Robert Ralston, a former chairman of the RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Sondri, the executive director of the RVL, knew about it all the time and they know now.
Should it make me think that it becomes personal?
Should the RVL courage to call for what happens in this business, other people besides coaches?
Is it bad for this profession?
Is it so bad for this profession?
Maybe people think it is.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt - what I now say, could force them to think about it.
But I have now got to the point where I don't care, and that saddens me.
I'm from this really sad.
I will put pressure on them and make them responsible for making decisions.
I have the support of the family, and I can leave.
Vexation coach only grew during the long investigation with cobalt and Lidari, and the recent removal of a horse from the start forced him to declare that he can "hurl his license on the table".
Moody is known to have prepared the invincible champion Black Caviar, called requirements for the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition "ridiculous" after the horse was done to compress his feet of clay, which is a violation of the rules.
This is a violation of the rules on the races.
"I must bear full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly made a compress on her leg.
She could receive a try last night.
She could get him yesterday as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody may be disqualified for three months according to the rules on the application of medical drugs on the day of the competition for the use of the compress over which the stewards opened an investigation.
This is a joke.
People who create these rules, know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it went too far," said Moody.
The driver who makes running-down and accident in Cobrama arrested
Police arrested the man, who at the weekend knocked motorcyclists in Cobrama and disappeared from the scene.
Motorcyclists were taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver left without stopping to help injured motorcyclists.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the town of Natalia surrendered to police in Shepparton.
It is expected that he will be charged with leaving the scene of an accident, failure to render assistance and violating other traffic rules.
Biker, a 40-year-old resident of Cobrama, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
The coach "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellamy parried accusations of rivals in the application of tough security techniques
The coach "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellamy called criticism of snatching the ball to his team as "imposing agenda" on the part of the two championship NRL favourites.
The coach "Sydney Roosters" Trent Robinson said the judges have allowed the "storm" "fight" with his team during a sudden storm "victory" in the final qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
"The Brisbane Broncos" coach Wayne Bennett made a clear hint of "storm" after his team won the final qualifying tournament at "northern Queensland Cowboys" on Saturday night when he called the game a "typical" for rugby league and said two of the Queensland team were not "too successful" in hand-to-hand combat.
Bellamy defended intercepting the ball to his team and said they were simply focused on the "contact", intercepted the ball.
Bellamy added that he inspired confidence that the criticism of his team by two leading coaches, because it means that they are worried about the possible defeat of the "storm".
"It continues to pop up - I have not heard that Trent Robinson spoke of hard when they beat us with the score 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can say that nothing we changed the whole year in their systems or techniques of protection, just over the last six weeks, we pay special attention to contacts when intercepting the ball, and it was a turning point for us.
Trent there for three years and he is clearly an excellent coaching team, so he is probably not used to play, and for him it was a shock.
It's funny how it always manifests itself at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea about the "impressive football", reminding his teacher, "St George Illawarra Dragons" Bennett won the championship in 2010, showing the "boring" football.
Wayne speaks about the exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our Friday night, and see how impressive was their game, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 "Saint George" many criticized, calling a boring team, and Wayne said that he does not care.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers the impressive football, especially their young midfielders with their speed.
This is football in which you would want to play when you have such players.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two midfielders such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play.
This gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably don't think about us when we get to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game "storm" and "Roosters" was a competition with more points than the game "Broncos" and "Cowboys".
The game "Broncos" probably was good, I haven't seen it, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18, there were still two attempts - and this is an impressive football?
Or consider impressive interruptions and unsuccessful attempts?
For me this is a routine.
If they mention about us, this means that at some point we can meet there with them.
The "storm" at the end of this week, as they won the right to host either "North Queensland Cowboys" or "Cronall Sharks" next Saturday night at the preliminary final at AAMI Park stadium, tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb accused of storing drugs released on bail of 200 thousand dollars
A man who threatens to life imprisonment for attempting to assign 40 kg of cocaine smuggling, delivered in Queensland, was released on bail of $200,000.
Marco Maksimovich, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the yacht Solay, going from South America through Vanuatu and moored in Kumer in August.
Throughout the morning, Fridman and his accomplices were seen at the marina, and he later met with them in the cafe Coomera roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in the car of the Toyota Echo.
Although Maksimovich threatens to life imprisonment for attempting to gain sufficient drugs for sale, the lawyer Maksimovich argues that evidence that the latter was trying to get the whole party, are absent, and that a man could be in a cafe without any intent.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovitch should be released on bail.
The latter has ties with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to police about the place of his finding.
His mother and stepfather Maximovitch were asked to make a joint pledge of $200,000 for his release.
"The testimony of both it becomes apparent that the amount of collateral $200,000 is too big a financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
But one of these measures are not enough as a guarantee that he will not disappear, added the judge.
Maksimovich was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passport, will be celebrated in the police daily and observe a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. in the morning.

Yes, I will need some time to restructure to the center position, still in the NBA, I played more forward.
Now will need more to confront the big center rival, but I have done it before, so I think, and now handle.
The last time player won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then, they have six times to get to the "final four" but every time they could not show their best basketball.
It is believed that someone jinx team.
This whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it is difficult, I understand the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team right now, and if we are going to show the best that they can, then we have a good chance to win the league, I really think so.
Always wanted to win this title, Muscovites have already won in the tournament, and I think this year will be a year of CSKA.
As for hexes, I am not a superstitious man and do not believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then everything is possible.
I have no certain rituals before the games, I just listen to the music and try to relax as much as possible.

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his clubmates should support the injured Jack Wilshere before playing with "Dynamo Zagreb"
In a conversation with Wilshere Wenger also stressed that still only September, and that the youngster will be provided if the recovery goes to plan, nothing will prevent him to return to the game for Christmas.
Scenario Wilshere will miss at least the next four games in England and, given the incident, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains under question.
Worst of all in this recent problem is that Wilshere confidently finished the previous season with only an ankle injury and was going to go back to the usual aggressive style of play during the pre-season.
Wenger: "This injury does not threaten his career."
It is simply not completely healed bone.
Nothing serious.
This is just a coincidence.
This is not related to the ankles or with the traumas that it has happened before.
This may involve things from a medical point of view, but also made Wenger, there is associated with the risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, the youngster recorded 23 different injuries that happened to him for six years since his debut.
In addition, he played in only 65 of 157 games "arsenal" in the league over the last five seasons.
If you look at hand for "arsenal" is broader, you will notice that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, "Arsenal" was one of the two Premier League clubs that are missed because of injuries days.
Wenger admits the probability of being stuck in a vicious circle, but in "Arsenal" believe that improving statistics on injuries in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, back to work after an injury, you have for some time been vulnerable - during this time you need to restore strength and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough and handle.
I hope he will recover physically, I am sure in this way and that his career will be such that he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in the Champions League match on Wednesday with the "Dynamo Zagreb" and will continue her game with Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday - with "Tottenham Hotspur", and Wenger intends to hold a rotation.
Héctor Belerin and Aaron Ramsey didn't come to Croatia, most likely squad will play Mathieu Debuchy and Mikel Arteta.
Perhaps Wenger will also introduce the composition of Kieran Gibbs and Nacho Moreal instead of Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little respite to those players who need it," said Wenger.
Although "Arsenal" unconditional favorite in Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most dispiriting in Europe.
"Dynamo" did not lose any of the 41 matches since they have managed to spend last season as "invincible".
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was exposed to earthquake force 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal has learned a lesson last season, when the team lost in the Champions League game against Monaco, and is hoping to lead the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
"This is an incredible drive," said Wenger.
"Arsenal" have never done.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially given how desperate the need for men to become frankness, now more than ever, with the rate of suicide among young men is at its highest level for 15 years.
In 2013 it became the single biggest cause of death for men aged between 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom, and three times as often happens with men than with women.
In an effort to understand the problem of "campaign against the miserable life" declared 2015 the year of men in order to challenge a culture that does not allow men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to accept the challenge.
Recently conducted a study of more than 2,000 university students, showing symptoms of depression, revealed that if a patient has a sufficiently large number of friends "in a normal mood", the chances of cure doubled.
Equally, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends twice reduces the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, that friendship worked, first of all you need it to be.
In an era when communications are controlled by social networks when the style prefer content, speed response is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life enhances the need to appear strong, loving fun and successful, even if in reality reigns loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which strongly influences our mental health.
And, as a billionaire recently observed, the creator of the video games, the money didn't buy more happiness.
The dignity of friends is that they attract attention to this.
Each of the characters is defined not through their work, but rather through a personality that manifested itself in communicating with friends.
Joey and Chandler's constant embrace of humor, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, vozdukhanie Ross and Rachel - everything comes from an understanding of what men can feel, even if they often refrain from a full study of their feelings.
As I said the employee "Samaritans": "... my role as a listener for people who experience depression and suicidal moods, underscores how even small communication friends can benefit."
Often those men who turn to us, feel powerless to speak with friends.
The old teaching "live with it" strongly, as well as a feeling that a frank conversation about the issues may be perceived as a weakness. "
Friends is one of those show that comes to mind when I try to offer longer working mechanisms to overcome.
It highlighted discreet moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of a stranger, talking on the phone, helps people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from the middle of the circle of family and friends.
So if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, where fully restored for holiday decorations, why not take your friends to drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see a man in Starbucks, smile and say "hello".
In advance not to guess what benefits can bring friendship.
Friends show on the Comedy Central series from the beginning to the end, all 236 episodes, in Daegu # FriendsFest
Di Maria scored a goal by helping the "PSG" destroy "Malmö"
Angel Di Maria, along with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani celebrates the balls into the gate "Malmö".
Angel Di Maria, debuted in the Champions League, scored a goal than to allow "PSG" easily circumvent "Malmö" on Tuesday.
Here's a report of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani made his case when "Paris Saint Germain" started its game in the Champions League with a convenient 2:0 victory against "Malmö" at the Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after he started his first game in the Champions League as a player "PSG" to set the direction of the champions of France, but they have missed a number of opportunities before finally increased their advantage when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with the "Real Madrid" and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, "bet" had to take a good start in the game against the champions of Sweden because they targeted the qualification playoffs, and the continuation of a series of successful games in the last three seasons, where they reached the quarter-finals.
They earn points, but at the same time was not the best solution by Laurent Blanc count Zlatan Ibrahimovic is useless in the attack and later replaced him on the field in a game against a team from his native city and the club where he started his illustrious career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or visit in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, deliver opponents problems and play good defense is a good start, even if there are still moments that we will need to finish during the season," said Blanc.
This is promising.
We wanted to win, and we did that, although I regret that we have not scored one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury in one of the replacement of the Paris team that brought her a draw with the score 2:2 in the match with "Bordeaux" in the first league at the weekend, but he pushed aside Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker marked as a player, able to bring "PSG" to a new level in Europe, after its last month bought "Manchester United", and he proved why, when he ran on a pass from Marco Verratti behind the protection of "Malmö" and beautifully finished attack by sending the ball past Johan Villand into the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone expected from the "PSG" light and a big victory, they had to be disappointed.
"Malmö" that defeated Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, having composed of nine world-class players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two defensive midfielder in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of the blow Nikola Djurdjic in which the ball flew past the goalpost gate Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
But "PSG" is time itself inefficient transmission and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who is only in the first half failed to realize at least five attempts, and then failed to handle the ball, Cavani scored immediately after the resumption of play.
However, he showed himself much more skillful in precise pass, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria sent the ball spin attack, which took place close to the crossbar past Wieland on 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayans scored his sixth goal of the season after after Ibrahimovic corrected the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flank Maxwell.
This will put an end to any thoughts that the "Malmö" to return to the game, and only to intercept the ball Wieland close range did not allow David Luiz to increase the final score before Ezequiel Lavezzi replace the goal at the end of the match.
Coach "Malmö" AHA Hareid later acknowledged that PSG were a class above his team, the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year".
Since then we have played only in the Swedish league, but it is not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Glory "bet"!
It was a wonderful match with them.

Around 100 buses have already "breathed" because it requires a new batch of machines from Belarus, which will work on gas, ecologically clean fuel.
Another aspect: Tyumen lift factory cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator production of "Mogilevliftmash", receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the program for installing new elevators in the regional center.
Add that as part of the expanded authority consul held a meeting with the governor of the Kurgan region Alexey Kokorin, during which we discussed the issue of increasing trade and supply of modern Belarusian equipment in the region.
At the end of September, scheduled a meeting with the governor of Omsk.

The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including the works of honorary 2790.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good that allow directly and quickly solve many problems, removing their sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
Under current circumstances, it is extremely important not to destroy the ground, continuing to work for the future.

The Nobel laureate — economics: globalization
Print out the processes of globalization should contribute to reduce inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in incomes of the population in emerging economies, by contrast, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To fix this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, believes the chief research officer of the international laboratory analysis and choice of solutions to the HSE, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics in 2007, Eric Maskin.
In the past twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between the two countries have become increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization predicted big benefits for emerging economies.
"And these forecasts are largely fulfilled," stresses Maskin.
For example, China and India have received significant rise in GDP per capita.
However, not everyone is so optimistic.
It was expected that globalization will reduce the gap between the "haves" and the "have-nots" in poor countries, which manifests itself in a large income inequality, to be exact - wages.
But in fact this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "why global markets do not reduce inequality in emerging economies," published in the World Bank economic review, which was translated and quoted by NIA HSE.
Together with the economist, Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the difference in income increases in poor countries as the growth of globalization, resembles NIA HSE.
The new global market specific processes occur.
To demonstrate, Maskin allocates four levels of specialists - And B for the rich countries, and D - for the poor.
After globalization specialists D from poor countries lack the level of qualifications to cooperate with specialists and B from rich countries.
And if the salary level with workers from poor countries is growing thanks to cooperation with the employees of B D growth from rich, workers do not feel either their wages are falling.
The final effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the wage gap between the two categories of specialists in poor countries and correspondingly increasing levels of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin offered a beautiful model, the alternative Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It helps explain why globalization has led to income inequality, "says Fuad Aleskerov, an ordinary professor, head of the international laboratory analysis and choice of solutions, head of the Department of Mathematics HSE.
And like any powerful theory, I am sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution of the problem, according to Eric Maskina is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the employees themselves, as a scientist, does not have the funds and unprofitable companies to pay for their training.
In such a situation can play a significant role for governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds, says Maskin.
The scientist said that theory was developed by no means calls to stop the process of globalization, which has brought and brings their fruit in the form of GDP growth.

At Domodedovo airport business was held "game".
In the capital is experiencing a new form of learning.
Four hundred students try themselves as employees of the airport.
To do this in Domodedovo aviagavan assembled three models.
Young people are not only inspected and registered passengers, but also served the airplanes.
All of this is in the form of business game, but the complexity of its reality.
Delayed flights, just two passengers with fractures on board, the plane lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For the present airport - hell.
In order, who settled in the hangar - a standard set of tasks that will tackle newcomers.
In one hangar fit three major airports from different countries of the world.
They now work four hundred students from Metropolitan colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn everything about the inner world aviagavan.
Registration of passengers, aircraft maintenance, the turnover of baggage - they trusted even buses on the airfield, ladders and passengers.
And passengers are all problematic.
One had problems with documents, another flight was late, the third filled a bag of suspicious objects.
And to deal with all this need, as in life - for a minimum term.
For each of these tasks they earn a certain amount, virtual cash as if the airline paid the appropriate amount for the flight.

The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret in connection with the closure of the library of foreign literature of the American Center.
The center worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow is deeply regretful about the Russian government's unilateral decision to close the American center of the U.S. Embassy in the All-Russian State Library named M.i.rudomino in Moscow.
"Unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times, questioning the commitment of the government of Russia relations between the Russian and American people, who are not interrupted even during the Cold War and other complex moments of a long history of relations between our countries," U.S. Ambassador John Tefft said in a statement, Interfax reports.
The American Center created deep and strong connections between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
He represents the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American dignitaries, among whom were astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Only last year the American Center spent more than 400 cultural and educational activities and took more than 50 thousand Russian visitors," the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to shut down another joint Russian-American project - a program of educational exchanges flex (Future Leaders Exchange Program.
The green tribunal turned out to be swift massacre.
The typical situation: four officials stand in front of the judge's table Swatanter Kumar, showered his claim to the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We will not provide you with 110-stranitschny order that you would on him, "says Kumar."
If anything will be put another brick, we ordered to demolish all existing buildings.
Kumar headed the National Green Tribunal (NRT) - the authority of the judicial authority, established in 2010 to stop the rapid environmental pollution, accompanied by rapid economic growth in recent decades.
During this time the tribunal had time to consider more than 10 thousand lawsuits related to air pollution, collecting garbage, geological developments, toxic waste and construction of dams.
In two of the three cases, the court accepts the decision to stop construction, leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: during the last 60 years since the announcement of increased industrial development of India's independence from the country of pristine jungle has turned into one of the most crowded and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large cities, where infrastructure has not kept pace with the rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers filled with pesticides and waste businesses and households, and the few remaining residential areas could be cut under the construction of new residential quarters.
Despite the formal support of the green movement on the part of the state, NRT is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
So, in May of this year, the environment minister, called the court's decision "extreme" and "unrealistic."
Sometimes the court's decision is impossible to fulfill in the court term, confirms the environmental affairs lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, unrealistic deadlines have a positive side: at least they make responsible persons to move.
"His main goal is to shake this system," the lawyer added.
The tribunal has already repeatedly cancelled construction: on his account to stop the construction of airports, power plants and hundreds of smaller structures.
It is about people trying to remember, too: for example, while discussing the fate of the pharmaceutical companies in the state of Telagnated, contaminating local river hexafluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," Kumar commented on his decision.
But such explanations are not always find an understanding of ordinary people whose lives can change with one stroke of the pen.
So, in April, the tribunal decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years to enter the capital than sparked nationwide outrage.
Despite the plummeting popularity and a flurry of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to rescind the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Delhi government statistics about travelling vehicle, and also made a proposal to buy 10 thousand additional buses, previously learned in factories, they will be able to perform such an order.
As the court began to get attention in the field of pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents, people's anger began gradually subsided.
But the most sensitive issue of principled judges became a program to clean up the river Ganges, announced with fanfare by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the River Ganges - sacred to Hindus, the judge often ceases to contain their emotions and moves to the creek.
You know what the word means "sacred"?
Someone poured water from the Ganges to the statue of the God, and it turned out to be faeces, "hot-tempered judge."
You continue to pollute the river because they think: The Ganges is the Ganges, it will take all our sins.
This is a river that we worship, and see what you're doing with it every day.
Cleaning the Ganges is the most ambitious and costly environmental project, announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the rate of more than 120 times.
Every year from 1.5 to 3 of bathing in it 700 million Indians die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to fund the rescue of the Ganges, proceeds from the sale of his costume in which he met Barack Obama and even 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the costume was bought for $700,000, while cleaning the river requires at least eight billion.
Supporters of The Green Tribunal agreed that India will have to go a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but it does not believe that the price of progress should be ecology.
"In a developing country to talk about the environment is often perceived as a luxury," says the activist organization "call of Ganga" Malika Bhanot. "
And the court is trying to find a balance between ecology and development. "

Xi Jinping calls to make the economy more open to the world
The economy needs to become more open to the whole world to spur its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in a speech to the group facing the task of leadership reforms.
