A social card from the Ivanovo region is recognized as electronic means of payment.
The amendments stipulate the preservation of the privileges on travel in the public passenger transport.
On September, 24 changes of the order of organization of preferential access of citizens using the social card of the resident of Ivanovo region.
According to the press service of the government of Russia on Ivanovo region, changes stipulate the preservation of the privileges on travel in the public passenger transport and lead the scheme of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 Federal Law "On National Payment System."
In this case, the social card from the Ivanovo region is recognized as electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the terms of its application change.
Thus, the deposit limit is set now not on trips, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter not more than 400 rubles, during the summer period - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now owners of the social card will have to track not the amount of the remaining trips, but the rest of the money.
The cost of preferential fare for citizens will be 1/2 of the fare operated by the carrier.
The remaining half of the fare will be reimbursed by the regional budget.
The rate of replenishment of the social card is still the same - in the period from 24 numbers of the previous month to 23 the current month.
A new setting on the social map will have a number of advantages.
Thus, there is a possibility to conduct a detailed account of expenditure of money on social card with accuracy up to kopecks.
Moreover, there is a possibility of returning the numerical but unspent money.
We also add that a scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent as now half of the fare is paid by the citizen, and exactly the same amount will be reimbursed to the carrier of the budget.
No commission will be charged for a cash deposit.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the Department of Road and Transport of the Ivanovo Region, reported that in 2014, there were more than 33 million journeys using the social card, in 2015-16 - nearly 25 million journeys.
There are more than 470 million rubles to provide preferential accommodation for citizens with the use of the social card.
As of September 1, the amount of reimbursement for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During call to 911 teacher admits killing girlfriend
During the call in 911, almost without droopsy school teacher Shannon Gilbert told police he shot his girlfriend and what needed staff who would come to his home.
Det stressed that the house has "p√∂dk," which is alive, but is probably upset, and said the contacts of family members of the dead can be found in her phone.
Inside the house police found Amy Prentiss's body and a note carelessly written off his hands on a white sheet of lynched paper: "I am very sorry I would like to keep me all back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," the note said, according to representatives of the body signed by Travis cloke.
Nothing indicated that Fiorina, who ran two online courses at the University of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had managed to travel 300 miles into a university campus where police believe he shot all respected teacher of the story of Itana Schmidt on the doorstep of his cabinet.
San Francisco police chief Linn Bayford said staff at the university learned of the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
He was reported to have made the true call in 911 shortly afterwards.
By the end of the day, the victims will be more than dead, once the police have surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the training facility forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, officers were still trying to fold into one picture of the motive, prompting the lampoon.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped produce a portrait of a talented but possibly concerned teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gotye, where Prentiss died, reported that there were no charges of violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included a lampoon in his writing book, in which he expressed his appreciation for "wonderful people" with whom he crossed into his teaching life.
Both of them taught at the faculty of social sciences and history, which numbers 17 teachers, and many students have attended lectures of both.
At the same time there were some preconditions for occurrence of problems.
One student who spoke well about Lambe, Brandon Brody, reported that he also seemed alarmed and nervous, "as if there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that at the end of the school year 2014-15 told him about how he struggled with stress.
Previously, Alabama asked the University of Delaware to grant him a holiday on the disease, saying he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university rules of reception meant that the doctor's degree on which he had worked so hard would not have guaranteed him an automatic job for a teacher.
The university's president, William Laford, said he knew nothing about the conflict between Travis and Sheen, but "obviously Mr Lambert had something on his mind."
These are questions that could no longer be answered.
Police attacked the lamba after his escape from campus when he headed back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was able to be arrested, McCoole was shot and killed by a 38-caliber handgun in the back yard of the house, one mile south of his parents" home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, told coroner Washington methyl Johnson.
His vehicle was still standing on the driveway.
It was not clear why he came to this house, though, according to Johnson, he believed he was aware of the people living there.
Hughgrown grew up in those edges.
Fiorina started working at the university, which numbers 3,500 students in a city with a population of around 12,000, in 2009, and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received a PhD in pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of Paul's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and cheerful man.
Karl Hairyston told me that she was 15, and I was 20 years old when they were introduced in common friends.
She and her friends were learning in senior grades and he was a cool guy tried, who for several years tried to teach her to play the guitar.
In those years, he enjoyed the success of women.
All the girls taunted when he was near," says Heather, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Braddon.
And Prentiss, for the moment of events, seemed to have met for a while.
During the call to the 911 call, he said, "I killed my wife" but a recording of their marriage registration is missing.
The pair had a dog named Lythning who lived with them at Gotye in a brick house whose flip side goes to the Channel.
Police said with the dog all right.
The former husband of Prentiss, Sean O'Stin, reported that they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and that they have a daughter now aged 19.
"She's totally depressed," O'Stin said about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he did not meet with Travis but heard from his daughter, Ebigel, that Whitney was interested in music and played the blues.
Gilbert met Prentiss when he and Ebigeyl both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they were together playing from time to time at the concerts.
O'Stone told his daughter to write music and sings.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, a bartender and a program coordinator of entertainment programmes in the dim area of The Julep Room in the foothills of Gotye, said he had last seen the lamour and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when he finished playing guitar and lipstick for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and had fun at each other.
In the sense that they were both very witty.
Schmidt, who died as a teacher, was carrying out seminars for the first students and specialized in Native American history and colonial America," said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of student fraternity and student government.
At the campus of the State University of Delta in Cleveland on Tuesday about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and community members, participated in a memorial ceremony of the candlelight vigil.
Sheen's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," Laford said.
The crisis is gone.
Today is the day of recovery.
Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare the authors of the Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenwich, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The footage has been edited in relation to a statement by the police that the call of the lamam entered a service 911 after the murder of Sheen, as well as due to the fact that although Matthews and spoke about Prentiss as saying to his wife when calling 911, information about whether they were involved in the marriage was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for holiday season
Toys R Us caddies that won't be hiring as many employees for the holiday season, as much as last year, with the retailer of toys and products for kids making sure it will provide full-time staff and temporary staff an opportunity to work more hours.
The company reports that it expects to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and at wholesale bases across the country that are less than those 45,000 who were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will start an interview with contenders this month and will increase staff numbers from October to December.
Although up to the holidays for several months, the buying season is getting closer, and the companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to have enough of the staff in stores and on sale, shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox joke about 'dated' with Princess Diana
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" appeared for Michael J. Fox a great event.
It has been notable for yet for personal reasons.
"We sat at the cinema and were waiting for the arrival of the members of the royal family, I noticed that the place next to me was free and here I was sitting next to me to sit Princess Diana."
The film begins, and here I come to my head, that I am literally at arm's length, and in one false shuffle, from the date with the princess, the princess.
"Back in Time" - a documentary about the film "Back to the Future" - includes interviews with Fox, Lia Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as directed by Robert Zemekis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" took place 30 years ago.
"For me," Spielberg says, is undeniably the greatest cinema of travel in the time that has ever been filmed."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVDs and in some cinemas in October.
UN chief claims military solution in Syria does not exist
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says in response to Russia's military support for Syria that for an almost five-year conflict "military solution does not exist," and the growth of the arms will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief has again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a news conference on Wednesday that he was planning a meeting with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council - the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France during a ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that divisions within the council and among Syrians and local authorities "made the situation intractable."
Ban Ki-moon urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated at resolving the issue of the nuclear program on Iran, and when considering the Syrian crisis.
8 poll numbers that show Donald Trump is not joking
Some tried to hang on him as a puller.
Others shied away from him, recreating himself as a joke.
And some require a scandal.
But, as any Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's high standing in the polls, they have failed (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's advantage in double-digit numbers, and some are starting to seriously ask what it means for a maiden estate in terms of chances to get the nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means Trump has the chance to nominate the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry succumbed to his precursor to the growing popularity of Herman Kane, none of which has won and one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fall into a general election.
But outside groups like America's "supercommittee of political actors" Jeb Bush, and the economic conservative group "The Growth Club" acknowledge Trump's unrelenting power and begin to deliver their dollars to overshoot him.
Here are some poll numbers that are said to be real estate magnate - not just the interim phase:
Trump's ratings of sympathy for Trump have stepped up at 180 degrees.
Directly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll at Monmouth University revealed that only two of the top 10 Republicans have positively treated this property tycoon in real estate.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now six of the top 10 Republicans have a positive attitude to Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators compete at the top of the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of Republicans there are going to apply to Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP vote would have arranged Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either treated "with admiration" or with "satisfaction" if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would have been "upset" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would treat "the delight" against 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
The next one on the level of delight?
Marco Rubio, who has just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they will be "not satisfied" or "upset" if plain-blower Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Trump is massively criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent leaning towards Republican voters across the country think that the magnate fit the temperament for being president, as the ABC News/Washington Post poll showed on Monday.
The same figure figures prominently on the nation's first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same person who could be chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent think he is not the man who can be effective in the post, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament is not appropriate for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
Gay Republicans get used to that thought.
When they wear their hats by connoisseurs, GOP voters think Trump is in earnest.
Asked who is the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was a favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's no longer the case when four of the 10 put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters had previously not had the right magical crystal.
In the same time in the past cycle cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported a possible Mitt Romney candidate.
Still, it shows that a lot of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as compelling.
Even if Republicans would rally round another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some economists point out that such disparity is more likely to play to Trump's advantage, and simultaneously unsupported Trump is evenly distributed among supporting more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in a hypothetical contest "one on one" between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He outscored Carli Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Keisich and Chris Christie on 33 points.
He has a draw with Toby Kledge.
The only candidate to do it?
Ben Carson racked up a businessman for a total of 19 points in a hypothetical competition "one to one."
Just over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they have passed away.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters supporting Trump say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he's never going to change.
46 percent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump's most tense competition at the moment is with knee outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have passed away are more likely to choose Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his speech opening campaign, the topic of immigration has become the most urgent in conversations in 2016.
Some worry that Trump's callousness heaps key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.
But according to the ABC/Post poll conducted Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as far as immigration draws universal attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain on the same position.
The government's frustration is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on support for about half of Republican voters, mostly because of their status as outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday a new ABC/Post poll claim they rather want a political outsider than a man with an experience in government.
And they are also offended by Washington.
A poll by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, held two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by congressional action in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "furious."
The government will decide the fate of indexation of pensions in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is seeking options for implementing legislation on indexation of pensions in 2016 for real level of inflation, reports of the WG.
She said the decision was to be found by 8 October, by the time of the NRL draft budget for the next year to the government.
Besides, Kabbalah has discussed the option of prolongation of the decision on freezing of the accumulated pension of Russians.
Golodec pointed out, the sum of pension accumulations is equal to 350 bln rubles.
Roughly the same amount of indexation of pensions in full is set for next year.
According to the vice premier, there are not yet any final decisions on the matter who should pay fees for non-working citizens.
Golodec believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not treat, thus, to the socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not quite fair that society pays for it.
Previously, media reported two options for balancing the state budget in Kabul.
Why are often irritated and reddish vets?
She is in charge of ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova:
Our eyelids are boxes that protect the eye apple from the multitude of small particles that are settled by them.
Forgetting about regular cleaning of the century, we often contribute to the development of bluefarita.
The solution is simple:
Do not trick your eyes with dirty hands, carry a special moist napping for an eyelid;
Not rarer 1-2 times per day cleanse the edges of the age from accumulated in them for a day of harmful substances.
Cleaning procedures are not necessary to supplement and heat compressors with healing herbs (sage, chamomile), inflating the thick secret of the sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelid, which follows the circular movements of the fingertips;
Cleaning makeup, do not use alcohol containing them.
They are dried and dehydrated by the skin and contribute even further by the secretion of the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear forces have created a nuclear warhead.
North Korea's authorities said the country's main nuclear reactor - the Yuan nuclear complex - was operating "at full capacity."
The announcement came on the website of the country's Central Telegraph agency.
It is noted that the DPRK is at any time ready to respond to "aggression and nuclear threat to the United States" and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "both by quantity and quality."
The last test of a nuclear weapon by the North Korean authorities held in 2013.
The plan for renewal of full work of reactor has not been reported since.
Pyongyang claims to have managed to create a nuclear warhead.
Also, the DPRK repeatedly carried out tests of medium and short range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded that he be removed from the Russian hymn to mention fraternal folk.
The leader of the LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that it is necessary to remove a mention of the union of fraternal peoples from the national anthem.
He was told during the State Duma meeting, "Russian news service" informs.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long hymn, the longest in the world, even the athletes don't stand up," Zhirinovsky said.
The MP believes that it is necessary to remove all the four elements in which this line is contained:
In the summer of 2014 Zhirinovsky declared that the current anthem should be changed to "God, the king of the custodian," and the Russian tricolour to replace the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident if Europe wants to tackle the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The issue is not that Europe accepts or accepts the refugees, but that it must eliminate the root causes of the problem.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the essence of the refugee issue," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue dialogue in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible, as long as the bloodshed continues, as long as the bloodshed continues and as long as people do not feel safe.
"Thus, we can reach a consensus, but we cannot implement anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
It should be reminded that about 500 thousand migrants arrived in the EU this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission said the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since World War II.
Thousands of militants of the extremist group Islamic State are not ruled out among the migrants who arrive in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
The residents of the German city staged a holiday for the refugees.
Over the past month Germany has been the leader of refugee intake, although recently it has strengthened border controls to contain their influx.
Authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts are called significantly larger figures.
More than 90,000 refugees have already arrived in the country since the beginning of September.
BBC correspondent Jennie Hill visited Darmstadt, residents of whom have a very warm reception.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut in a session of questions to the Prime Minister
After Mr Corbyn's election his debut at a session of questions to the Prime Minister is expected with a great look
The new Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will soon be on a session of Prime Minister's Questions, for the first time by merited by forces with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of six allotted questions in the afternoon; his performance is likely to be closely watched by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He issued a call for "less theater and more facts" at a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he might miss some meetings, leaving them to their colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as a leader; it will happen after the appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual trade union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silently during the performance of the national anthem at the service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, drew criticism from a number of Conservative members of Parliament and became the topic of several advanced papers in the papers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the state anthem caught the attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he was "standing in honourable silence" and acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his conviction for the need for the abolition of the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to play in Mr Corbyn's team, voicing disagreements on the issues of economy, defence and international politics, while less than one sixth member of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political divisions are also "digging in foot" in Labour's party after appointing Mr Corbyn to a post in the European Union and limits the government's compensation scheme.
Mr Corbin told the trade union conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the very idea of limitations on the whole.
Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said the party had "full clarity" on the account of what it was in opposition to only the government's plans to cut the upper limit from 26,000 to 23,000 pounds.
Mr Corbyn will become Labour's fifth leader, with whom David Cameron will meet the "courier's box" over the past decade since becoming leader of the Conservative party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, claims he has "attracted collective resources" to roll out the ideas of issues to Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
A Parliament member from the Ilington County District Court said the Prime Minister's questions cause excessive confrontation and that he will refrain from witty answers and exchange of quirks, instead pledged to focus on serious issues like poverty, inequality and the challenges of youth.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Igl, the minister of economics at the shadow cabinet, would replace him on the issues of the prime minister when he would be absent - for example, when Mr Cameron is overseas.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the word at the opportunity, saying that he had applied to the speaker of the House of State Jr. Berkshire to discuss the issue.
Becoming leader in 2005, Mr Cameron announced he wanted to walk away from the political style of "yarder ballaghan," often associated with a procedure by the Prime Minister, but admitted a few years later that it failed him.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's questions have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to govern the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say that this has turned into a caricature and demands major reforms.

Sterling grows as UK wage rises
The pound rose amid wage growth in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising due to a proposal to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, minus bonuses, grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth has been the highest since 2009, and has been met as a transfer to earlier forecasts for potential growth of quotations.
Sterling rose by more than 1 per cent against the dollar and was $1,5505, and at 0.84 per cent against the euro, amounting to ‚Ç¨1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 at 1.49%.
In the general background, SABMiller's shares rose by 20% thanks to a takeover offer from rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world by collecting brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares edged up 0.9 per cent on the back of an encouraging news from rival group merchandise group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures have surged on all expectations and showed sales in China - in the key market for Burberry - have again started to rise.
Shares of Glencore rose 5 per cent after the mining giant announced it had managed to gain $2.5 billion by placing shares, which had been made under a debt reduction strategy.
Shares of the group on paper and packaging materials Mondi were leaders of the fall in the index - up 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs downgraded the group's rating to "sell."
JD Sports shares rose after the company - a sports apparel provider reported an 83-per-cent rise in profit before tax for six months to $46.6 million.
Vanguard JD Sports says higher wages could discourage expansion
JD Sports executive chairman Peter Caugill says raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in the cost of labor costs, he says.
The costs could have affected the plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean reducing the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a campaign on the initiative from below to combat Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from an Aldi lawsuit in South Australia and Western Australia.
The wholesale food supplier on the initiative from bottom has launched a campaign to protect the market share of retailers IGA in South Australia and Western Australia in light of the upcoming $700 million acquisition of Aldi.
While Aldi prepares to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of its 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, supermarkets Metcash and IGA strengthens the relationship with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand through marketing in the leading media and social networks and at the Adelaide Show brands.
The campaigns are being joined by retailers and IGA suppliers, such as the ice cream maker Simmo's of Dansborough, which offers tasting at the IGA stores, and shop owners selling off the discount to regular customers tickets to the South Australia Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29 - a day when this wholesale supplier of food, liquor and household goods will spend its annual day investor strategies.
There is a lot at stake, since in South Australia and Western Australia stores under the brand IGA make up almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as adherents of the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for the IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in Utah and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 percent in eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will roll out 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, picking up sales at all present players, but mainly by independent retailers.
In a report this week, Tom Cirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales for the year, and Metcash - $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on assumptions that Aldi next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA, producing sales of 500 million and $600 million in these markets respectively.
Metcash's loss of revenue and sales volumes at a high level of constant costs could cost the company about 13 million of revenues before interest and taxes, Mr Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and that's when a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA had the most loyal buyers.
At Morgan Stanley, Metcash sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016, up 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company's stake in the market from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week's leading stock manager, Heather Douglas, founder of Magellan Financial Group, spotted the present at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash "could have a high probability of disappear over the course of a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly comment on Mr Douglas's comments.
But it is alleged that a member of the Board of Directors of Metcash contacted Mr Douglas last week.
The share of IGA on the market has declined since 2010 from 18 to 14 percent, and Metcash's revenues from business in the food sector, which the company supplies around 1200 IGA retailers, fell 43 percent compared to 2012 due to operational deleverage, and due to pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not end up spending more than $150 million annually for equalising retail prices with the prices of Coles and Woolworths on a thousand-mile weekly and helping the IGA retailers in the rearrangement of trading platforms, as well as offering a rapidly expanding product range and a wider selection of branded food.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says the price tag and re-equipment of shopping areas is gaining momentum and hopes the company will succeed in increasing net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports Tennis Australia president Steve Hili
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves a pope rather than criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly hurt in the recent scandal around his friend Nick Kyrgios and for his behaviour deserves a pope more than critics, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Hili.
Kokkinakis, a junior in a talented duo and often called "Special KS," unwittingly proved to be in the limelight because of the shameful skirmish of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Soon after, during a hot qualifying match in the Cincinnati judge on the embroidery had to twice dispel Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrisona, with Harrison declared: "The Wanderer should have laid on the shovel of Kyrgios, and I have to lay on the shovel of this guy."
C, as Kokkinakis last saw a wrecking rocket after cramming into his leg rescued by Rishara Gasquet from a possible defeat at US Open, Hili precept shields Kokkinakis.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Frost for the right to be second after Bernard Tomic is in solitary discharge in the Davis Cup semi-final against the UK.
"I am extremely worried about one thing, namely that Tanasi was drawn into the conflict," Hili said.
He really broke the missile when he had a foot on the US Open, but he wasn't the first player to break a rocket when collapsing hopes and I know Tanashi good enough to be sure that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact he owned himself very well in quite provocative situations at US, with Harrison and so on and I'm sure he deserves credibility.
He is surrounded by a great team, he has a beautiful family, and I just think that he has done something wrong with him.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he has a lot of work, perfectly fits into the team, he never had any problems with the other players, his respect outside the crown, he's intensely trained, he's in excellent shape, he's a very determined and developed young man and I think it should be appreciated by the merits.
Hili also backed the decision to forgive Kyrgios for the sake of an important match beginning on Friday, believing "mutual consent" is the right way out for everyone, but calculated that the guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all we want the team to fully focus on the match rather than the controversies around [Kyrgios]," Hili said.
And I think that Nick has scored the power very quickly, which is proving people like Federer and Marrap, he's growing up in front of the public, he made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions and necessary, I believe, bring him out of the spotlight for some time so he can reflect on them and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migrant crisis in Europe: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, detains migrants
By announcing an emergency, Hungary on Tuesday shut down the border with Serbia on the southern border and deters those trying to penetrate the country illegally to stem the flow of migrants.
On the border there were unrest - hundreds of migrants were buried on the border area, which the Serbian authorities reacted sharply.
Stuck on an indefinite time on the road between the checkpoints of two countries, people fleeing armed violence at home have broken up tents and grounded out on this terrain.
However, the discontent was mounting.
When the police helicopter circled them over them, migrants shouted "Down the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian police special.
Some in protest refused food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister announced an "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary when they are increasingly arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of a solution to the problem, not collateral damage.
It is necessary to hold negotiations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dachich in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian border began the day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a general immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to bear common responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and have expressed hope that future (next month or by the end of the year) will be reached by an agreement under which states - EU members will accept another 120,000 refugees - including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded to gather next week an emergency EU summit to discuss the immigration crisis engulfing the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for swift action by Brussels or its neighbors.
Declared on Tuesday a state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to action against the crisis, allowing them to overturn the roads and speed up court cases for asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Sijbright said his country was planning also to take a fence from a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to shut down the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata said even prisoners were connected to urgent work on completion of a fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has been a major "bottleneck" and a point of crossing the EU's borders for migrants, many of whom are refugees - the victims of the wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most arrivals in the country are economic migrants, seeking more welfare and not refugees - the victims of military action, which are entitled to protection, and this view will sharply diverge from the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which joined Hungary into force at midnight, are thought to be now a crime of crossing or damage to a 4-metre (13-foot) fence from a barbed wire built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and includes longer jail terms for the accused in human trafficking.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovach said in the southern city of Seged.
We are clearly giving it clear: Illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Formally parliament still has to sanction the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters who are on the border for several days are watching the presence of armed to the teeth of servicemen with vehicles and dogs.
Dern Bakondi, an adviser to the National Security Agency, reported to the authorized bodies of 45 people attempting to cross the border, at the border, and another 15 people inside the country.
They have crossed the border, having broken the fence, are currently under police guard and are accused of carrying out administrative violations under new laws.
Authorities are quick to recover the fence.
Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven passes along the border with Serbia, fit to block one of the aisles of a rail car, winding up a barbed wire.
The unrest broke out at the main pro-crossing across the border near the town of Raleosk (Hungary), as Hungarians posted an emergency room to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds pressed each other to break inside.
The passage inside was managed by about 20 persons, with thousands of people being left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road from Serbia to Hungary and refused food and water until they were missed in Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders halves in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the Democrats' race for the nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching it.
Clinton now has support in 47 percent among Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent) and Sanders goes second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to participate in the presidential race, gets the support of 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
In more than five months before the electoral rivalry began, most Democratic voters are saying it is too early to say that they have defined themselves with the candidate who will support.
Clinton supporters are more confident than supporting other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton holds a big advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has dwindled.
Its support among men has substantially fallen and Sanders is lagging behind it by just 5 points.
The preference given to Clinton by the Democrats for up to 50 years is gone, and they are with Sanders now on equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among more senior voters.
Last month, Clinton trailed Sanderes by a double-digit percentage among the Liberals, but Sanders now has an edge in five points in that group.
Nearly half of Democrats across the country said they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would have supported her with some reservations, and a further 15 percent would support her only because she's a candidate.
Six per cent would not support her.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm for her account.
Among those at the moment do not support Clinton, the view is more controversial - only about a quarter enthusiastically backing it.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the smaller number of Republican presidential candidates say the same about their lead, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters set an open question as to why they want to see the candidate her, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then - that now the time of the female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 percent).
Also, Clinton supporters talk about an association linking her with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also called agreed not on the issues and odds of electing.
Since the vice president is voicing a potential participation in the election, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to join the race - though a third believe he shouldn't be.
When asked if they wanted to see a second seat among the party's candidates, the GOP Democrats in most cases called Biden.
Among Clinton supporters more than half say they would have chosen Biden a second, that's more than Sanders did.
If Biden decides not to show his candidacy for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Bayern among the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democrat voters see Clinton a candidate with the best chances of winning the general election; however, that figure has dropped from 78 percent last month.
At that rate, Biden was a standout in second place, but the percentage of those who regard him as the most likely candidate has increased.
Nevertheless, when asked what is most important in the candidate, the GOP voters choose other options beyond the chances of being elected.
Similarly to the situation last month, none of the candidates from Democrats or potential candidates is an uninvited nominee for these primary voters.
Candidates from Democrats, or potential candidates, have shown a good result on some key characteristics among primary voters from his party.
Most consider Clinton, Sandersa and Biden to be honest and credible by people with good leadership qualities.
Biden is out of all three leads by honesty, and Clinton's strong side in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't consider Clinton fair and credible, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanderes (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have a certain view of it on that score.
The GOP's primary electorates also generally consider Clinton's similar ideological views, Sandersa and Biden.
By all these measures, about a quarter of Democrats have no opinion about Sanderse.
While the questions about Hillary Clinton's personal email server and Hillary Clinton's office are continuing, most of the Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation on this account and believe that this did not affect their overall opinion of her.
But it's a very different story from the American public in general.
Half of the Americans today are dissatisfied with her explanation, but satisfied with just about a third.
Public opinion was divided even in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy over the email has not influenced their overall opinion on Clinton, though 36 percent say their view of her has deteriorated.
There are mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim their views on Clinton have deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers fair and credible voters from her party, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: Only 32 percent think of her fair and credible, eight points lower compared to last month, and by 15 compared with the maths.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not view its fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not view Trump as fair and credible.
Clinton and Trump both, however, are getting good marks on leadership qualities.
Of the six contested Biden candidates, Carson and Bush show a better result on honesty.
Most see in Sanderse a more honest person than not, but, as about Carsone, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 of the Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
National poll by Ben Carson closely approached Donald Trump
Ben Carson closely approached Donald Trump in latest CBS/New York Times poll
Two of those candidates scored half of the vote in a new poll, leaving everyone else in search of the lead under their feet
Gay Republicans across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose percentage of support increased from 23 percent in a recent CBS News poll conducted ahead of the debate on Fox News last month, up from 27% in a poll conducted Tuesday.
But Carson soared over the same period from 6 per cent to 23 per cent.
The poll also showed that Carson enjoyed support in all demographic groups, sweating Trump in a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the candidates, with the exception of Carli Fiorina and Governor of Ohio John Kasich, stepped back together with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Hackabi and Senator from Florida Marco Rubio together take third place with 6 per cent.
The limit of error for a selection of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is minus 6%, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson's growth in the polls - showing support for 19% among Republicans, behind Trump with 32 percent support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump significantly outpacing Carson.
Due to the growing support of Carson last week, Trump made a number of critical hits in the address of a former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are accused of the death of first-degree Baruch College student
About two years later, after the death of a college student during a ritual dedicated to a fraternity in Pokono Mountain in Pennsylvania, the murder charge was raised against five people.
"The members of the brother-in-law Pi Delta Psi of New York College Baruch brutally attacked Chan's "Michael" Denga during a ceremony in September 2013 and did not bring him back to hospital that caused his death," police said.
Officials say a student with a blindfolded and 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back several times pushed while he was trying to reach a goal by going on the slippery surface.
Mr. Harper eventually complained that he had a sore head and then fell unconscious.
Fraternity members Pi Delta Psi did not call 911 when the intruder lost consciousness, and waited for an alleged hour before delivering him to hospital, police said.
They did, however, find time to change Denga's clothing, find in Guridge his symptoms and contact Andy Mengh, the fraternity's national president, to ask the council, as police chief Chris Wagner said in a news conference.
"At this point, members of the fraternity began hiding the personal possessions, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity above the health of Michael Denga," said shaker Wagner.
He was unable to save and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Fury has received several blunt head injuries, tweets and hips.
"Too many families have suffered as a result of the rituals of dedication to the fraternity, because at least one student dies during them every year, starting in 1970," said a statement by Douglas Faerberg, a lawyer representing the family foundation.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable and this step by the authorities is very important.
The jury County Monroe bowed in favor of the murder charge of a third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr Menga, will be given the charge of domestic violence and criminal collusion.
"We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organisation that has authorized all of this or unofficially both," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College banned the fraternity and the nationwide fraternity excluded from its structure the local branch.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be a rate hike, and "the bull market" is stumbling, bond yields will rise, and the economy falls into recession.
That we know.
What we don't know is how long it will take until this time, and how long that will last.
Specific to the economy, history shows little about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for the whole 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
That is why the administration of the US Central Bank has so insistently emphasised that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise rates, but on how much adjustment will take.
Indeed, there are many variables in the game.
After all, however, market participants may find that all fuss around raising rates is exaggerated.
"The first increase in rates by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the signal of the end of an era of "cheap money,"" said Julian Jessop, chief specialist at the international economy at Capital Economics, in a statement to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
That does not mean, however, that the consequences will not.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy might react, depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the last month or so, waiting for a rate hike could lead to instability for a while.
When raising rates, however, the consequences are usually not that dramatic.
"It does not seem that the proceeds of the shares are based on 12-24 months after the first jump, which, again, probably reflects the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent survey of the results of the Federal Reserve rate hikes.
If more concretely, the market for the last roughly 35 years is more likely to change sharply - about 14 percent - in the direction of rate hikes - remains fairly flat for 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, at the rate of 500 days, returns to a normal state with an average yield of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob Long, a principal trading analyst at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche said that the result for securities tends not to be more pronounced at the rate of rate hikes, and earnings from stocks are beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but raising rates often play by them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that have not existed before and can precipitate recession.
Basically, gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point in the lifetime of an increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of the rate increase since 1950 only twice nominal annual GDP was below 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few believe that this is for a long time when it holds only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates on such an unstable economic background can be risky and raises the question "will this time differently," reported Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates for the Federal Reserve all year round, with their view drawn up by the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends Thursday.
As long as many experts on strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a rate hike at this meeting, the futures trade speaks only about a 25-cent probability.
"In our study, since 1950, all the cycles of rate hikes before today were in the supercycle of an increased fiscal lever under GDP, overlapping of the peaks before recession, very quickly after recovery," the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle at the moment - the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months; it only lasts for 74 months and is not over yet.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market is expecting a rate hike, and this scenario is somewhat like the one that is being implemented for the shares.
The principal difference is that there will be an effect in the bonds than for shares when the Federal system changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that yields change the vector immediately after the first increase / reduction of rates in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of rising rates, bond yields are immediately falling," Deutsche said.
Strategy specialists from Charles Schwab believe a rate rise will result in the rates of long-term and short-term bond yields close, making the curve more flat.
High-yield bonds often behave better in such a climate, although "we still fear fluctuations in returns," according to the study of Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes markets have already adapted to the expected outcome of Fed policy.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations there are signs that the market has been rigged towards the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is more flat, the credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market in tightening the policy of the Federal System.
Speaking in general, companies leading the core of their business in the US will benefit from rising interest rates, and local production will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts will be worse off as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global marketplace, and their debt more expensive - financially.
"History shows that "quality" shares demonstrate efficiencies above the market in the three months after the initial rate hike," said Goldman Sachs' analysts in a report for customers.
Companies with a stable financial condition cost the company an unstable condition on the results of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004, at an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital ratios and stocks with low volatility also showed better performance than low-quality stocks, averaging 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will be a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
Aside from purely exchange-traded deals, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Depositors could see profit also through higher returns, though experts diverge in how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM," claims member of parliament from Conservatives Andrew Bingham
MP Andrew Bingham's parliament slams the station for "cutting standards"
Proves it becomes increasingly different from commercial rival
Also targeting the BBC Music Awards, saying the premium is just soda off the Brits
A colleague of parliament Damien Collins, who crashed on The Voice with as much criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is transformed into Classic FM."
A member of parliament from the Conservatives, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC's leadership that it seems as if a public radio station is "foolish" and becomes increasingly different from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to me I don't like using the word "simplification" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you try to do something different - here are two examples that first came to me in mind, in which you actually only copy what is already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC director has rejected the allegations, claiming BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and education audiences.
The fact that I learn from Radio 3, I don't learn about classical music anymore.
And his devotion to live performance and making music really doesn't compare any more to anyone.
"Also really very important, I think the Radio 3 interest is in the search for new music and in promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3's manager Alan Dave argued that radio stations have to work a lot more to attract audiences than in the past, because Britons are less educated in classical music.
However Radio 3 was not the only BBC watch that has been attacked for coming on the heels of commercial competitors during a hearing by the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of parliament from Tori Davidson Collins has attacked The Voice - a music show of talent, which the BBC has bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an indicative price of ¬£22 million.
You can see why this program is often discussed because of lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims the BBC 1 show, in which as judges involved Paloma Feth and Ben George, was done in a "typical BBC style."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit in its own home horse," the next time it will launch a entertainment project.
However, it does not consider it necessary to prevent new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the licence fee for other entertainment formats.
Growth of Internet sales slowed in August, and wine may be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015 there was an increase in online sales by seven per cent
Last month marked the slowest growth since it began watching in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago by mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday massacre could have helped deter the grass
For about a decade, virtual shopping is booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost towns.
But experts say there have now been signs of aligning online sales, after the latest data showed just a seven-per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Overall spending on online shopping in August showed minimal growth since they started fixing in 2000, increasing just over five per cent.
Experts say there have now been signs of aligning online sales, after the latest data showed just a seven-percentage increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the pace of growth in previous years and return to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said the Guardian's Andy Maltokhi, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained online sales activated three years ago when shoppers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
That meant more people were given the opportunity to buy online and that they could do it in any conditions, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it goes to the plateau and you can see a decline (growth).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe shoppers could refrain from shopping ahead of the event, which is taking place on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, buyers in the number of five times the average rushed to the computers to make use of the lucrative offers, by crashing out a number of booksellers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers go into real fight for lucrative purchases, could force people to refrain from shopping
According to the study published by British Retail Consortium, just over 1 pound of cash out of every 5 is spent online.
As for commodities like TVs and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through internet shops.
Meanwhile, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online hunter-gatherers than in fashion shops in central streets.
Muslims bury dead at the fall of a crane in Mecca, and Bin Laden's family are vetted
Muslims pierce bodies of 29 dead by streets as in Mecca start first funeral
Simultaneously Saudi Arabia partially blamed the crash on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Department of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims from everywhere were glassed in the streets to bury the 29 of the victims who died in the crash of the crane at Mecca's main mosque.
Dressed mostly in white, they were present at the funeral procession to the passing of a part to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went to their last way at Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed through the sacred place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane punched the ceiling of the mosque and fell to the parishioners.
The bodies were issued for the funeral, and simultaneously the king of Sawites fined the construction company owned by Bin Laden's family, for an accident in which 394 people were injured.
Bodies of 29 parishioners who died at the collapse of a crane in the Main Mosque carried the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children Kasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was in his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr Akram was in the Major Mosque along with his parents before the start of the annual hajj stampede.
The Saudi authorities have already pledged that the Hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said that Binladin Group should not have left the crane to raise at a failed crane.
In an Arab version of the decider published by state agency Saudi Press, it says that Binladin Group carries a partial blame for the crash.
The English edition of the news agency did not mention this detail, but reported that the company's leaders were banned from travelling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman pledged to find out the reason for the collapse of the crane into the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were dug to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group made no statement about the crane collapse and its representatives turned out to be unavailable for comment.
The Royal decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improper approvals of actions with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Main Mosque, a massive construction site that leads Binladin Group.
The Bin Laden family has been among the closest Saudi Arabia's ruling families for decades, and is run by major building projects.
The late Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a raw material player from whom the family rejected in the 1990" s.
The accident happened under strong winds and rain just days before the kingdom arrived in millions for participation in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in life for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said at the hospital there remain 158 people.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about 174 000 pounds) to relatives of the dead, and the same amount is irreversible.
The other affected will receive half that amount.
Chapter B & Q argues that the trend is explained by the presence of East European masters working for small money
According to Veronik Lori, Britons are increasingly hiring specialists to repair
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result is the discovery of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
Simultaneously Kingfisher covers 60 stores of B & Q warehouses all over the country.
By: Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail's chief urban correspondent
They say Britons are set aside for a hammer and light brush, and instead employ qualified Eastern Europeans to perform works in the house
If you are able to treat the hammer or scrape down the walls, you seem to be in the minority.
Because, according to the owner of B & Q, Britons are still hired by master craftsmen to perform easy work at home.
Veronik Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home service network, said that this trend is a substantial influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open more than 200 Screwfix stores, specializing in products for masters, and at the same time close 60 stores of B & Q.
MS Lori said she would like to see more women in B & Q's staff line-up as eight out of ten decisions on purchases in the shop are accepted by spokespersons of the weak sex.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to her, it is impossible not to notice and the latest demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of households consisting of single women, who are more engaged in the condition of their dwellings than in the past.
MS Laurie said: "In our stores, mostly men are still employed.
Steps need to be taken to achieve the balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women and 80 per cent of decisions on purchased goods are accepted by women.
Women play a greater role in the decision-making process.
MS Lori is one of five women standing at the helm of the leading British companies, whose shares are registered in the FTSE100 index.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50% of managers are women, including the general and financial director.
MS Laurie said: "It was a conscious decision, diversifying - an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women for the board of directors was not easy.
After the group took the cost of closing the stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales for half a year.
As a result of this trend Kingfisher, which owns brands Screwfix and B & Q, opens 200 new stores
Time of decision on interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching the Federal Reserve's meeting, which for two days is discussing the adoption of a crucial decision - to raise or not to hold an interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A poll of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that just over half of those who were still last week believed that the Fed on this would go, now believe it will continue to replace and keep a rate at the current range of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, because it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered its rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching that the main bank can move from zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Anhele Ubida, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is working effectively, the economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
But the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the solution will affect the world economy.
He warned markets that they should prepare for change, but everyone talks about their confidence that all the odds are against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: Refugees go to the EU through Croatia
"Welcome!" tweets hundreds of refugees at a checkpoint from Horgoh on the Serbian and Hungarian border.
On Tuesday, Budapest closed the border for migrants.
Asylum seekers are already starting to forgive other options for EU routes.
One of them bypassed the closed border with Serbia lies via Romania.
The other is through Croatia and Slovenia - in Austria.
According to some data, the buses that have taken refugees from Serbia into Hungary are now heading to the town of Shid at the Croatian border.
Drivers were given an order by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Neuposha Stepanovich assures that his country is doing all of it dependent to help refugees, but its opportunities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we should also help these people, ensure humane treatment.
But this is a pan-European problem.
To solve it is not easy, no country in Europe alone will not cope with it, and especially such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open a border for refugees who don't want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Premier Victor Orban is adamant:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia, he must fill in necessary documents.
And if he does not, then he will not be in our country, because Serbia is quite safe.
Hungary has already erected a 175-pound fence along the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: He plans to take the same fence along the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that it is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimar: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Maymarakis, for a number of years, was a member of the center-right government, which led the country to a financial crisis.
Now, he has become the interim leader of the New Democracy party, challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he had met with a journalist called euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to euronews!
Vangelis Maymaracis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party failed to defeat the Syriza coalition, but now, according to the polls, New Democracy has been compared to it in popularity.
What has changed during this time?
Wangel Maymaracis: Changed Greece, and we too.
Mr. Tsipras traveled much in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and its growth prospects.
Now the country has a budget deficit and high unemployment.
Investors have gone because Mr. Tsipras has run them.
For the past nine months, the Greeks have been able to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promise of Mr Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare the promised with what actually happened.
Everyday life became noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, with most Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that in the event of winning elections you will seek alliances with other parties, including Syriza.
Wangel Maymarakis: The fact is, as we've figured in recent years, Greece can't move forward without understanding and collaborating.
And it is no accident that in all other countries where there were or still bailout programs, political forces and all ruling parties were put together to implement a program on which they reached consent without relinquishing their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at the present stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to go ahead.
Euronews: Your party voted in support of an agreement between Mr Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If Monday you become the new premier, will you carry out this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Maymarakis: In fact we voted for Greece's movement on the European way, because it is well presented that the disastrous consequences would lead the country's exit from the EU.
Now Europe helps us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have funds of solidarity, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost if there were no agreements with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were a result of Mr Tsipras negotiating.
I know that Europe is unwilling to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
So if Europe sees that the new Greek government in the first year in power wants to impose order, act rationally, and makes clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the bailout program, then, I am sure, all the accepted commitments that cannot be met because of the recession may be negotiated again, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to think that, in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors as they await the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue to privatise, reform and structural changes that have been agreed by continuing to enjoy the benefits of EU funding and large investment opportunities that we need to open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of negotiations, Tsipras's government did not present any serious arguments on many key policy issues that we have learned, discussing these issues with our European counterparts.
I can cite an example related to the incomes of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that it is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be taxed in advance.
We were told that Tsipras's ministers never spoke about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and ill-informed, but because they failed to negotiate and concluded a bad deal.
Euronews: If you win the election, soon you will be at one table with Mr Juncker, Ollandom, Mrs Merkel and other European leaders.
Will it be different to what you say, from what your predecessor Antonis said to tell them?
Vangelis Maymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we tried best to deal with the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners.
We were pushing forward the reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and quickness but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell and there was no potential buyer willing to pay the price for the Greek government.
I was a speaker of parliament at the time, I was able to agree on the opinions of the three parliamentary groups that were up then the governmental majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on the key bill, we had a functioning parliament, and that's in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations held outside.
And we were able to bring the country back to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by early universal elections, which were the result of the December presidential election.
Euronews: Recent weeks on Greece's territory are moving the mass flow of refugees.
What do you think about this situation and the reactions of the European countries in which these people aspire?
Wangel Maymarakis: The Refugee Crisis is a bomb of the slowing action that we have to deal with after winning the election.
And the reason was that the Syriza government did not act in this situation as it should.
In such matters, it is necessary to act ahead, because if the problem falls you are only extraordinary measures.
And we are in such a situation now.
Even the interim government, smashing Syriza in just seven days, did more than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim government, which provides valuable assistance to the president of the republic calling for a summit of the EU, will allow to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice - refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of any extraordinary events that happened to them.
This question has a deeply humanitarian aspect and we will stick to the position that European politicians should take in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be made at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee intake centres.
We must also effectively use the economic aid we receive from the EU to be able to deal with this urgent problem.
Euronews: Mr Maymaracis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Maymaracis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzhevsk Donetsk region for the day, criminal investigation officers of the police department of the field in cooperation with military counter-intelligence established and detained the suspect who appeared to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian serviceman from the city of Krivoy Rog (Dnepropetrovsk region), who, on the eve of the evening, in the course of joint use of alcoholic drinks, and the emerging conflict in the village of Upper Unetoretsky, Donetsky, shot from the machine in his opponent.

Man discovered shooting at Delta State University left a note with apologies
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the same day - Shannon Mathews wrote a note saying he "regretted" the first murder and would like to "all recover back," the authorised authorities said on Tuesday.
Police in Gotye, Mississippi, reports a lecturer in geography and social sciences at the University of Delta, called 911 at around 10 a.m.
Monday and reported that he had someone shot.
Obortold dispatcher that police needed to send people to his home.
He reported: "Last night I killed my wife," and also mentioned that the house has a "pineapple," which "nobody will touch" but is probably upset.
The police were asked the name of the caller, but he did not name it.
Coe did not explain why he opened the shooting.
Having arrived at the scene of the crime, police discovered there body Amy Prentiss, 41, and written off the arm of a note from the lamas, 45, who said: "I'm sorry I would like to return all back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
Writing the note, Ash drove 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Itana Schmidta, a history teacher, and the evening on Monday when he was surrounded by police, committed suicide.
The university's rector, William Laford, said he was not aware of any conflict between Travis and Schmidt, but "Mr Mr Lambert clearly had something on his mind."
Despite the information on Monday that they had foreseen the novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services on Tuesday reported "no information or evidence" of the "love triangle."
About Prentiss has withdrawn as a "good man" by Sean O'Stein, who is reported to have been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Stin said he and Prentiss have a daughter, who is 19 and that she is "inconsolable."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsey Noulys, who the San Gerald newspaper calls a close girlfriend of Prentiss, the latter was working from home through the internet.
Noulz said that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lythning clique and that she had met with Travis for about three years.
Noulz said, "she always wanted to help people."
Police said Monday at some point called relatives to say that "in prison he won't go."
On the evening of the day when the police struck him on a highway "1" near Greenville, he stopped the car, jumped out of it, fled to the forest and shot there.
According to the CV posted on the university website, in the spring of 2015, Allergan has received a degree from PhD in the field of pedagogy.
Stars losing their luck
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has suffered several difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his perennial companion to the life of Farru Fosett, who died of cancer.
The actor reportedly suffered a drug addiction, and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this has certainly played a part.
Hatch Show of Manchester United has been out for months due to a double fracture
The hatchet of the Show broke the right leg in two places during the Champions League match in which Manchester United lost PSV to Einstein.
While the defender is in charge, who won't be able to get on the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes the Show will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during Gector Moreno's reckless subpoena in the 15th minute when the 20-year-old Show cropped into the PSV penalty zone.
He was assisted on the field for nine minutes and provided oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture, and he's in hospital."
It will be transported to Manchester tomorrow or later in the afternoon and then operates.
It is terrible - the young man came to Manchester United at age 18, has overcome great difficulties and has started to play fantastically, and here it happened.
In the dressing room there was an oxygen mask on it.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months, and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and was not assigned a penny.
Referee Nicola Ritza did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gal believes an Italian judge has made a mistake.
Judge yourself when I say it's worth a penny and a red card.
It was a very ungood underpin with two legs.
In his tweet, "Thank you all for your messages, words not to describe how I am devastated, my journey to recovery begins, I'll be back even stronger than I was."
Still on the subject: Manchester United is experiencing adversity with Luke Show under defeat in game with PSV
Guardian Britons will have an extra incentive to adjust to the European Championship in France next June.
Filtering coca, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very hard injury."
When any player comes up with a similar injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to traumatise the enemy.
Moreno suffered a fracture of his leg when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Galya at the 2014 World Cup.
"He is now very difficult because he had no intention of injuring an opponent and when you hear that it is a very heavy injury, then you feel unwell," Cooke said.
I had no opportunity to see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked as though it (Moreno) touched him, but I didn't see a forehand under Luke.
In conversation with SBS6 Moreno said: "I know what it is like, I know how hard it is to carry it.
I'm very hard and I'm very sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smollingwood.
Does David Cameron know about "Lorraine" anything else?
Each parent is very quick to learn one thing: If your child likes some book, it will take a little while before you know it almost by mouth.
Apparently, unless you are David Cameron.
Responding to a question by a spokeswoman for the organization of children's holidays in a holiday, about their favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Lorax" - a fairy tale with environmental dodgy, written by Dr. Susan in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a commentary published on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "This hilarious, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to your kids is because it always reveals some image or message that we skip."
And all would be well, apart from the latest paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to recount the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the iconic film, filmed in 2012, with new characters and details added to a variety of fairly short original storytelling.
"In the surrounded by high walls of the city Almighty, where there was no greenery and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Odri - the girl of his dreams, having performed her desire - to see the real tree," - read us in the text a description of the love story, the unknown Dr. Susan (real name Theodore Susan Heisel), who died in 1991.
If it doesn't seem to be too suspicious, Cameron's text reads almost as a brief recount of the movie "Lorax," posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the surrounded by high walls of the city Almighty, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Odri - girls of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, while admittedly an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the content of a book in which not named after name the boy learns about how the greedy cutting of trees and a visionary "commonright" of Nakhodka's protests (whose name has been made in the name of the book) is a funny creature with usas, which "speaks on behalf of the tree."
Most likely, such a simple PR task was entrusted to the executioner, who had never read a child with a book 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokesman said the text was allegedly received from Mr Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed the text was obtained from Mr Cameron's headquarters, but further comment was not followed.
For Adam Lite clearly there was a risk not to get into the squad of England, but it's still a complicated issue
Victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is an impossible task, but if you look at the assembly that England has chosen for this tour, the replay of the Test series with a score of 3-0 that happened last time doesn't seem to me likely.
I would also not rule out winning on my field.
Alister Cook's team is perhaps less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but in it there are players who have virtuosity, virtuoso taking steep balls, and collective thinking strongly; they will not bring with them the scars of 2012, and only the youth positive.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns a bowling ball, clipping the steep balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown figure for Test level, is an attacking option.
Still on the subject: Adam Lite has been out of England's Test cricket team and replaced by Alex Haylins
The decision to rule out Adam Lita to me, his main coach in Yorkshire, of course, is difficult to analyze.
His seven Test matches have had two good attacks in challenging conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that the cricket players are scoring judges according to the result.
There were no questions on Jay Ruta, for example, that led to this announcement because (and I have already said this before) players best choose themselves.
The pair half-grinded and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in charge of his own fortune.
We hope that if he takes more wounds for "Yorkshire," there will be another possibility.
The head coach of the England team, Trevor Bayliss, spoke well about his mood, even when he did not show what he is capable of, and that is not surprising; he is primarily a team player and then everything else.
The question of how much time will pass before the benevolence of Test cricket will leave an impression - a complex issue.
Trent played in seven games as well as Sam Robson to him, and Nick Kompton is nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play on his and on the alien field.
The only thing you could regret is that England chose Jonathan Trotter for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in the best form but this lost opportunity is already in the past.
Alex Hays appears, and he is a bistman, whom I assess highly.
He's an unpredictable cricketer that we were and seeing at the Yorkshire club earlier this season when he earned 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as someone who has been before him, but it will certainly depend on the team's composition in the UAE.
The thought of putting Moan next to Cook as the opening batter, which would have given an opportunity to introduce extra spinners, retaining four speed bowling, is vociferous and I'm not at all against it.
There is no reason why a beating player can't beat the ball, but the left-winger has already shown that he is a fucking good cricketer.
Moeen, perhaps not quite what's needed for his county Vustershir, but became the third number for them, and the big difference here is No.
My old team-mate Justin Langer has played his first 38 Test matches for "third bionic" before coming out as the opening scorer in 2001.
He won just three hundred and not looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a reserve spinner, and when he was there, he showed me a very promising young man.
People can look at his approximate statistics - an average of 31 with bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a risky bet, but among the spinners voting "for" a little bit, and the pick up the youngster.
He is learning a lot about this tour.
In addition to the national team, England are planning to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahle Jayauhorina, a shrier-lanyard bartender, as a consultant for Test matches, could have been a masterstroke.
He is one of the best guys for the game, which brings the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where a white ball is used and will provide both energy and a ruthless pace in the grid.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it was a game or a coaching job and, like Mahela, has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes the new voices in the dressing room, even if they say what has been said before, can give new strengths to the team.
Kohli's co-star Ben Stouks is left for one-inning, Rutoff is given a similar break due to Australia and I, for example, don't care about the problems.
Although not everyone will agree, coaches and individuals selecting players do not specify the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never made easy.
UK supporters' camp out of EU could win if the economy is in depression by 2017
David Cameron's ill-conceived policies on renewing negotiations to keep Britain in the EU each day are increasingly difficult, even without looking back at the election of genial Jeremiah "This is yes or not?" - Corbyn leader of Labour or the TUC's indignation over Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their Korbine and Nigel Faradji.
A friendly European diplomat explained recently that the situation in which the EU is currently experiencing a variety of crises is not all of their own making - some of the country's member states on the throat of the British ego-centric agenda of concessions and undermining arrangements of change they largely do not want.
Gathered in Brighton for an annual meeting, the TUC has decided that he doesn't want them anyway if they break up social protection.
We could even call it "the village of Dave and George's camp."
The Premier and the finance minister are riding summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographing themselves against a backdrop of a known local monument, in a company of local celebrities or without it, then come home and say they are attracting allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be interested in maintaining external contacts to Britain under the EU's EU - "Don't leave us together with France," says Berlin - suggests that the submersible ministers and officials in some capitals reach an understanding of when they will still be left and left.
Angela Merkel, the highly cautious chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation for her worsen as she has deteriorated to the ambush on her seat of Thatcher (11 years), Mitran (14) and Kohl (16).
French President Francois Hollande faces re-election or a replacement in 2017.
He, too, loses power.
Poland could soon gain a nationalist right-wing government, Spain is the left.
It is hard to see them tumbling out of the skin to help "selfie-razors," whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from going out of the UK - which they also don't want because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue a deliberately useless remorse in the SNP style during a referendum campaign in the UK in 2017, to spark the process of Britain's exit from the EU, suggests my friend.
"The renegotiation was ideal," and "Britain did nothing much from the resumption of negotiations."
Europeans, for their plight, know the predator may be Flit Street, and as sceptical about the EU is set by the media tycoon, in contrast to the time of the running of Tony Biden's referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 by a ratio of 2: 1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a retired Euro opportunist famed for his "direct bananas" by the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Millibands knew who his enemies were.
They included a motley company of the feared taxes of julics, cellphone hackers and pseudo-non-residents who own the majority of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was about them entirely of the same opinion, but gave himself a report that when you are in a cage with a wild gorilla, you have to give her a bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
According to Milliband, Blair was more committed than Blair himself in confronting Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair acted in favor of the EU's repeal constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him.
But Milyab Jeremy Corbyn, who friendly booing me on his back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time to spend it on me - seems to risk repeating the strategy of the Nile Kinnock "boycotting Murdoch" from the 80s - a mistake and then, and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy of interacting with the press - not with me, but quite exactly with Andrew Marr, on the tea of a diver in the Air Force he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolving.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the trailblazing trend of UKIP and the broader circle of "supporters of small England" among the torches could probably say "yes."
It is the same as Hilary - "Benn, but no benevolence" -Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his domestic boycott struggling to acknowledge that the appointment of Corbyn skipper John McDonnell's "shadow" finance minister was a bad idea.
That reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father struggled to get on TV for disloyalty to colleagues in the Labour cabinet, without going too far and losing his post in the cabinet.
The battle of Hillary was more attractive.
But the fight to stay "under any circumstances" is Benn's phrase - not that, McDonnell said, and not that J. K. spoke to the bees and members of parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, admittedly.
In order to be able to tell the Democrat and "his fellow" Korbin - remember, he touched even me - the discipline of the messages remains an important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in the whirlpool of social networks, the point of paranoia and betrayal.
It is reasonable - not to give Cameron so just to separate from Europe, allowing him to take as granted the support of Labour during the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins is definitely so thinking.
But the main fallacy of McDonnell and Corbyn over EU membership - within the "benkering" economy of the besieged fortress - is no longer a question of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism generated by insignificant distinction is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misgivings about Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that J.C. will not campaign for the exit - foreign diplomats will be required to try to bring this to their leaders at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin be spending political capital - they too have suspicious voters - to surrender to Britain, when it can all be pointless?
The US is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even as the government of the torso in power cuts expenses that I was reminded on Monday during a lunchtime at a non-forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize review of e-cigarettes from Public Health England
Statements by the agency's government-funded agency that e-cigarettes were 95 per cent less harmful than smoking were heard at the meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in conjunction with the Lancet have criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its electronic cigarette report.
PHE published an important report - a "turning milestone" last month, calling it a "comprehensive survey of evidence."
But some researchers questioned the authenticity of the data and pointed to the association of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month split "an extremely shaky argument" on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers wondered whether these claims were "solid or firm grounds."
Martin McKee, a lecturer at the European Health Institute at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Klingwell, lecturer in clinical epidemiology at Leeds University, reported: "A fundamental principle of health care should be based on proof of efficiency."
According to them, the public expects the PHE claims that "the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tabacocration" was based on a detailed breakdown of evidence and modelling.
In fact, it is derived from the only meeting of the 12 people assembled for the development of a multicrito analysis model of decision making in order to summarize their opinions about the harm associated with the various nicotine products; the results of the meeting are summarized in scientific publication.
Makki and Kepwell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, a general directive reported that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT certificates in the health care report on sustainable development.
One in 12 people at the meeting announced a funding from the e-cigarette maker, without mentioning the funding it reportedly had previously received from Philip Morris's tobacco company.
A reasonable explanation for the choice of council members was not available, but among them there are some prominent supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom have also claimed to fund the industry in publication.
It is not known if there were other participants in the management experience in the tobacco case.
The meeting was also visited by the head of the tobacco business in PHE.
The scientific paper, published by the group, is "graceful agrees" that there is a lack of "weight evidence of the harmful impact of most products on the majority of the criteria," wrote McK and Keewell.
However, none of these links and limitations have been affected in the PHE report.
Makky and Keewell told PHE that PHE claims that "at present there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, resulting in children or non-smokers to smoke," are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and welfare in PHE, said that BMJ's statements had previously been given the answers.
He said: "e-cigarettes are substantially less harmful than tobacco."
One of the two chickens died of his addiction.
All evidence implies that the dangers of health from e-cigarettes are relatively low, but we must continue to study remote consequences.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what to prove and what these evidence proves, especially where there were doubts about the relative danger in tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking disease and smoking is costing the NHS ¬£2 billion a year.
It is clear that although e-cigarettes are not safe, they only do part of the damage done by smoking - we do our tasks in front of the nation.
Former Channel 4 presenter believes BBC should stop EastEnders' series
The former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop releasing such programs as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would do much for such a successful show as the soap opera about "Plaza Albert."
Johnson noticed that licensing fees should be used only to create programs that are not produced by other British TV and Radio companies.
He has spoken out with criticism of the BBC for being a public broadcaster, which is sure to look at only a small portion of the audience, on the peak time when competitors go to the show with high scores, and on channels like BBC4.
After BBC director-general Tony Hall said the corporation wanted more cooperation with other organisations, Johnson noticed that he had in his time spent six years unsuccessfully trying to establish a collaboration with the BBC while working on Channel 4.
"I can't separate from the thought that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast transfers that could show rival companies not receiving subsidies," Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee as part of the BBC's further fate.
If you save a license fee that I do not consider a good solution in the medium and long term, then companies should be left with only those programs that are not produced and are not collected by other companies.
The Voice shows the broadcast in prime-time, because the creators want to gain as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that nobody will show it is laughable and apparently absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go on funding passes that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is generally known that they own production.
There were no other channels, no doubt a lot would be given to her.
I don't understand how this can be a public thing.
I don't think it would somehow embrace the BBC.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led the Channel 4 channel from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of the employees and because of their belief that this is the best way to get support for a long time."
His comments about the most popular shows on the BBC are tagged with comments by Sky's executive director Tony Ball, who in his lecture memory of McTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003 offered the BBC to sell the gigs of EastEnders.
Johnson noticed that more niche transmissions of the BBC public are "continuing to go on BBC4, where often you can't rate an audience, but the function of the company is accomplished, and it can be charged as an argument in hangovers who excite the income from licensing fees of $4 billion: "Well, of course, we do all these incomprehensible transmissions that no one looks at."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
"I urge you to find a more regressive system about who is most likely to receive.
Of course, you all think, we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is big money, I wonder, they think so because they're not really watching and listening to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive director David Elsten, who also spoke to the committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of "informed, enlightening and matchmaking."
He noted that now only a minor part of the BBC material is formally classified as educational - he says it is 1% of television content and 0.1% on radio - and that the company should take the initiative of the Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the slogan "informative, enlightening and entertaining."
On the partnership, Elstein observed that the BBC should make more effort in such spheres as "Promenadnaya concerts" (only part of them, he said, is shown on TV), as well as joining alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available to watch online.
'Sonogenetic' allows brain cells to be controlled using sound waves
On the video you can see how the nematodes change direction of movement at the moment when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have led the worms with a genetically modified nervous system, which can be controlled using the sound wavelengths of the sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction of movement at the moment when they are affected by sound impulses, too high so that the human ear can hear them.
Impulses have an impact by activating neurons, genetically modified, to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Still on the subject: Researchers run brain activity by light
Scientists have told that the worms demonstrate the possibility of a new method called "sonogenetic," whose essence is the use of ultrasound for the excitation of certain brain cells, heart and muscle, and the source of ultrasound is located outside of the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Solka Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure whereby a person's brain is sent by electrical impulses and which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
The nematodes usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they started to react when they were placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles increase the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves affect the structures called "ion channels of TRP-4," found in the membranes of some of the worms.
Ultrasound waves make these ion channels open and excited the cells that are dealt with are reported in the report in Nature Communications.
For the creation of nematode, which can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of worms so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 channel channels.
During ultrasound to influence modified organisms, sound waves amplified microscopic bubbles and injected into the organisms of worms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to those used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to include and turn off neurons using light pulses.
Chalasani argues that, compared to this methodology, sonogenetic may have some benefits.
In contrast to the light which is delivered to the desired part of the brain on fiber optic, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can flow freely through the tissues of the organism, so it is not necessary for their delivery to go inside the shingle box.
"We believe that in order to treat certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to take time to make human neurons sensitive to an ultrasound signal," Mr Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin producing cells.

Advertising adverts slammed on British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's video with a protest against the arms exhibition.
Terrific killer drones!
The devastating naked iron shackles!
Cassette bombs!
Electric lightsabers that cause unbearable pain but leave no traces!
The cheerful voice and the drawn animation leaves no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibition - a parody of parody, prepared by Amnesty International in order to draw attention to the British government's intention to "push" the weapons of repressive regime by taking part in the "ExCeL" center in the Docklands Exhibition of Defense Technologies and Security Systems.

But the special campaign also leads to a sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and the Tube trains demanding to look at them once more.
"The important announcement coming along the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them by a London subway font with a picture of the DLR line turning into a silhouette of a tank.
In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers nailed to the DLR line: Passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters are drawn by artists who exhibited their works at the "Museum of Cruel Design" at Becksy's Park "Dismalend."
A team called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them across London using a "set of cracker advertising locations," a 6-pound set of gainer keys, which, as a foray, "gives access to about a third of the advertising space on the planet's bus stops."
London's Transport Workers have suffered from such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the paedophile ads released by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gary Grindon, curator of the events of Cruel Designs and a teacher at Essex University, artists become more demanding and eager to convey political art to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists begin to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go to the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against an arms exhibition greeting passengers on the Tube.
A video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by a VCCP agency working pro bono, involving a graphic designer and a voice recorder, also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lover was impressed by the promotional silence around the arms exhibition - with a skip in the ExCel calendar - and thought: "Let's organise them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and creepy corporate advertising, but "filling it with bright colors and animation turned out to be a more immersive affair."
"They have incredibly helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal vacuum cleaner at the show," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the UK government to take action and ensure that this vacuum cleaner will not be illegally sold directly at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the topic of an arms exhibition goes from inside the ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphemistically products.
The Saab's press release revealed the order on "AT4CS RS for shooting from the shoulder," coming from the U.S. Army.
It includes "no analogues cumulative boyhood, which brings unbeatable reservations inside the target."
Whatever he does, pleasant it won't be.
Eight golden rules of living in student hostels
It has already been 11 years since I moved into the student hostel as a normal 19-year-old man, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and numerous, long complaints on others.
Basically what I learned is possible to decompose by eight simple rules.
Moving to the dormitory can vary from slightly acting on the nerves to absolutely frightening.
He urges the chatter: Telling people, from where you have, whether you've got an academic holiday and where it has been, whether you're supporting Corbyn and why you're "honest, neither I hate" Marmayt, because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast of hahaha extract, I'll be at myself."
Freak out.
And help others to rest too - ask questions and demonstrate interest.
It supports conversation and helps you to find people you like, not those with whom you wouldn't even talk, even if you had eyelashes, but they would have given fire extinguishers.
Let's go people space.
The rooms are often transformed into a pool, half-night cinema and public squares, but they are also a place where people dress and adjust the underwear.
Still on the topic: Don't even think of going to university while in a relationship
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room should be a refuge, but many dormitories form a culture of shakiness from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to a long friendly relationship.
It could be hell for someone trying to regain power.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "You like me, and I want to continue with you, but I need you to go, and I've been able to restore the energy I have spent to communicate with you."
Try to feel when the co-cadaver is tired of talking - and not knocking to him, but to send an SMS.
By the way, on the note: Do it.
One guy in my dorm was following such principle: If the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Breeders and friends with the help of baking.
As you start a university life at the peak of the show Bake-Off, then knocking on the door to people to introduce yourself and put up a plate of chocolate biscuits - no longer such an odd action, is not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we neighbours, I'll have something baked and now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions."
Offering home treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end it is likely that your face will be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good the baker is.
Unblindfolded lumps of flour, sugar, and fat are more likely to cause people to pretend to be asleep when you're going to get them.
Stealing a meal is a typical crime in student hostels.
Of course, assigning someone's chicken - theft, but is it theft - to take a bit of milk for tea?
Take care of the owner of milk.
Most likely he will offer you not to be shy, even if inside is boiling from rage.
If someone forgets your things, it's annoying, and I don't feel like it - but try to get to this adult than my neighbor, who poured into my milk fluid for washing dishes to avenge those who took it without asking.
She is now in prison.
You don't have to produce a noise that's going to discourage people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the most people of the saying about glass at home.
A girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to kill the sound of the drum and the bass guitar as it was 3: 00 in the morning, and in the morning of the exam.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he stopped at 5 in the morning, she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours and then rubbed his music and locked the door behind him for a three-hour examination.
Didn't romantically wonder if your future spouse had settled in the same hostel as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely, before a bit of elbow, clumsy, if you had accepted your neighbor for your future spouse, was fascinating to them, a vicious relationship and would have to see it every day, and perhaps watch as it drags on your side of all your shared friends?
Of course, the heart doesn't show up - but if a hot neighbour is exactly not your future spouse, try to cool down your own dust.
At that exciting moment when you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between the draw and the grass is thinner than it seems.
A good draw is fun but turns to its opposite in seconds.
Take a valuable and interesting lesson of safety by hiding anything - but never in a box of toothpaste and shampoo.
Back at the other door and drop the keys into a glass of water that you then put in the freezer - but not sticking another thing with a tuck of a Blu-ray Disc to the ceiling more than two times.
IOS 9: How to install a new operating system on the iPhone following the release of an update from Apple
The new operating system can be requested by entering the Settings application, select General, and then - Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download it and install it.
Some have encountered problems after the installation when you receive an error message telling them that "the application upgrade has failed."
In order to avoid it, users are advised to either wait until they have a revival or attempt to upgrade through iTunes.
Hints on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process until the end.
The process may include removing apps to increase free space - but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the upgrade, and has also simplified the execution by using a special utility that proposes to remove the apps and re-install them once the process is complete.
Note that when you perform an update, your phone is charged or located next to the charger to prevent battery discharge.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update because a phone lag in the process can cause the update to crash.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by a telephone call.
Us Secretary of State John Kerry phoned Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad leads only to aggravation of the conflict.
Meanwhile, the White House chapter is not going to talk about this with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
Us Secretary of State John Kerry phoned Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
PJ Media reports.
"Secretary Kerry made clear that the further support for President Assad by Russia poses a risk of exacerbation and prolongation of the conflict, and also negatively affects our common goal - to fight extremism - if we also do not continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power," U.S. State Department officials said.
They also noted that Kerry once again highlighted the U.S. commitment to fighting "Islamic State" within a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be able to be a member of it.
In addition, the US "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in trying to counter the Islamic State."
On Friday, White House officials said they do not know exactly what actions are taken by the Russian troops in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House press secretary Josh Ernest said that time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the president decides that a phone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will raise the phone and try to make that call."
Barack Obama himself regards Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime as "a losing bet."
I remember our conversation with Mr Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake that further support for Assad would only worsen the situation.
"But he didn't listen to my warning - and as a result, the situation worsened," the US president said.
The imported yachts will be exempt from paying customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means for rest and sport from paying customs duties and taxes.
Amendments to the list of eligible goods for temporary tax-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
Izvestia was informed by the assistant minister of economic development Elena Lashkin.
In June 2015 Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the results of the trip to Crimea commissioned a number of agencies - Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Emergency Services, FSB, FTS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals for creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts point out that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, maintenance and maintenance of the yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about ‚Ç¨200 million each year go to European states for maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development prepared a draft of the decision of the Eurasian Economic Commission on Amendments to Perechen of Goods, temporarily imported with full conditional discharge from payment of customs duties, taxes," stipulating a full conditional discharge from payment of customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports.
According to the ministry, it will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in coastal areas of the country," Lashkin said.
This issue has been made for consideration by the subcommittee on customs and tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in the foreign trade of the Government Commission for Economic Development and Integration, which was held in September, and on the results of the discussion was also approved by the agencies.
As the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure on full conditional release at import is essentially a grace.
Therefore, after the approval of the protocol of the meeting of the subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development would submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member states of ENPP, explained Lashkin.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to support foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for application in the sphere of science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, to provide international assistance and other facilities - service equipment (personal computers, recording machines), control laboratories and workshops, water skiing, racing cars, motorcycles, sports flying devices, books, newspapers, magazines, music instruments and objects for religious ceremonies.
In the press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation "Izvestiya" have told that prepared mandatory regulations by the sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatoria, which stipulate the simplified procedure of the execution and exit of small-time, sports sailing and pleasure ships at sea port.
The Mintrans are given instructions to capital of the maritime ports of Crimea to ensure the application of simplified order of small, sports sailing and pleasure ships in the sea port and the release of the mentioned ships from the sea port.
In addition, the Ministry of Transport has prepared draft orders of the Government of the Russian Federation about the approval of the borders of the coastal port area of Crimea.
In respect of Yalta and Feodosia orders are already accepted, the rest are under negotiation, - noted in the press-service of the department.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state supervision, classification and examination, state registration in respect of small-sized vessels used for non-commercial purposes must carry out the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that Russia is extremely difficult with yachting due to weak infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there is a constantly growing industry in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coast is a little interesting, the only one where the yacht can be operated is the Black Sea in the vicinity of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, and Anapa.
But the great difficulty in this area is extremely strict border control rules: In order to get a walk on a yacht, you need to build up a lot of permits.
Besides, inside Russia, a yacht, even unsettling.
For two days, she can go with his fuel, and then there is the problem where he can take it," said Nordmarine's sales director, Denis Novikov.
As for the storage facilities, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. The yachts are also transported to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that the buyers of the yacht are rich people, but since the beginning of the crisis the demand for yachts has decreased.
The World Bank allocated Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million to develop the financial sector.
This was announced by the press service of the international organization.
"The new funding will support a number of priority measures for reform in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the report said.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Cimao Fuan, said reforms of the banking sector would help revive credits in the real economy and stimulate economic recovery.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities took impressive steps to reform the economy and at the World Bank observe the first signs of stabilization.
But due to the seriousness of the problems, Fuan calls on Ukraine's government to accelerate reform.
Earlier the Polish government approved a loan of ‚Ç¨100 million to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reports.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
On the Public Council at the Federal Service of Punishment (FSIN) on the protection of the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues will discuss the possibility of creating in columns of separate blocks for transgender and transvestites.
Vladislav Grib, a member of the Board, spoke about it.
In his opinion, depending on the total number of people in Russia who are not determined with sex, in domestic prisons it is possible to envisage individual cameras, blocs or even (if such criminals are many) at the prospect of creating a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that defining the punishment of citizens to such isolated places is possible only after the convicts will undergo appropriate medical expertise that will prove that the perpetrator is truly a person identifying themselves as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is convinced that the isolation of transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of the punishment.
According to him, the offered practice successfully operates abroad: In the detention centre (where the accused are before the court's decision) there are separate cameras for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special units.
Today, this is the only way to work with such criminals.
Unequivocally they need to isolate, because the presence of transvestites and transgender people in conventional chambers is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN staff.
The humiliation of the trenches by the co-cameras is guaranteed," says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big a city is, how many criminals with undefined floors, it is necessary to count on where to distribute them.
Detention centres are not exactly needed - only cameras, prison blocks.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if transgender people are much.
Grib explained that in the block can contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized body is created in Russia one, then punishment prisoners transsexual will be able from any regions.
Citizens are kept in custody at the place of crime, so the receipt of transvestites or transgender persons from other subjects during the investigation and judicial process is unrealistic, and here is the practice for prisoners in a separate colony - yes, Grib believes.
It should be reminded, on the eve of the law enforcement bodies were unable to decide in which an investigating insulator - male or female - to determine the detainee for drug possession of 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kozukova (known under the name Alina Davis), because of which a man with a virgin appearance was not arrested.
He was released home under a subscription for no-leave.
This news was widely discussed on social networks and media, as the transgender mechanism in custody and colonies in Rosalia does not exist.
The Russian human rights activist, activist of the LGBT movement (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexuals), Nikolai Alexievich supported the idea of creating special places for the punishment of transgender people, noting that overseas it is also possible to define people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yes, it is a very small percentage, but the problem is there as well as the issue of security in prisons for homosexuals," Alexeev says.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made in the name of this and for homosexuals, the more so that their prisons are more than transgender.
Alexeev doubts that in Russia there will be a lot of citizens ready to extradite themselves for transcologists for the sake of getting in an excellent colony.
Of course, it is possible to enter a medical examination before placing people in the colony for transgender people, but not always all is unequivocal.
For example, in the US, one of the prisoners, Chelsea Menning looked like a man and had already in prison declared he wanted to change gender, Alexeev said.
A person can feel like anyone else.
But while there are no places to be punished for transgender people, I doubt that prison staff will be thinking seriously about the safety of such people and getting into the nuances of their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health at Russian Federation Boris Lhorutanidze noted that the introduction of a new distribution system for transgender offenders in the colony could severely delay the death of convicts.
A commission is created - it is a matter of sexism, psychiatrists hold lengthy observations, it is not one test based on which is made a precise conclusion.
Today's opportunities for psychiatry allow this.
Therefore, and before the end of the sex, the potential patients have always had such an examination - they show exactly whether a change of sex with surgical intervention is necessary," says Lune boiled.
However, it is hard for me to imagine how this system will be implemented in relation to the convict, because on average there is a month.
The doctor, although in general the idea of creating separate blocks for transgender people, also doubts that, under current economic conditions, it will be appropriate to allocate funds for building new premises, medical expertise, and transgender people in Russia.
It is difficult to find out, there is no official statistics, but if we consider that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it is possible to say that transgender people are even smaller, and those who have such a deviation and commit crimes are at least a small amount," said Lune boiled.
Now under the petition before the administration of the colony of homosexuals, transgender people and so can receive separate conditions of content.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
Khanty-Mansiysk has finished the championship of chess tournaments among juniors up to 20 years.
The end of the Championship was more than intrigued.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and became a Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to overtake the regiment of Yana--Khalves, which seemed to be confidently going to the title.
Natalia Bukhsa, a Ukrainian chess player, was celebrating the girls.
The World Chess Championship in Khanty-Mansiysk, already in the middle of the tournament range, seemed to lose almost all of the intrigue, as the Polish representative Yasin Krzysztof dude, who has given a series of four victories (the competition is held under the Swiss system in 13 tours), has confidently grasped the leadership.
Given that the dude was a qualifier of the primary, and generally considered to be one of the most promising young chess players, the chance that he would miss out on the reached out was quite insignificant.
And even when he was able to slow down and allowed Russians Michael Antipovich to cut just 0.5 points, he remained the obvious favorite in the title fight.
For Antipovu to catch up with the leader, it was necessary to win in the 13th round.
But even that would not help win the dude of his party.
In addition, this commitment of the victory, of course, could have affected the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently managed with Francesco Rambaldi, and then had to wait for his party to complete the dude, met with a Biden fighter.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player broke the opposition with the Dutch draw.
Thus, Antipes and dude scored an equal number of points - by 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipova had the best extra scoreboard.
And therefore it is the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, the governor of which Natalia Komarov, who traditionally pays much attention to the development of chess in the region, handed over the main prize.
And here in the competitions girls intriguing condos didn't happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Bukse (Ukraine) - for conquering the title was not to lose in the last tour, which it successfully and done.
Thus, the victory of Russian woman Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Buckingham.
The Russian athlete remained second with a runner-up from the championship score of 0.5 points.
VimpelCom is changing the regional structure.
The company unites Volga and Ural regions in one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and Far East - to the region of the East.
The project will be completed by November 1.
According to Vimpelcom's CEO Mikhail Slobodin, the changes are being made to "remain a strong player in the market," developing the company "in new, not always favourable external conditions."
In an interview with Rossiya TV channel "Russia 24" Mr. Slobodin said that they intend to reduce the "tens of percent" of personnel in Russia.
Rospotrebnadzor checked 78 Moscow snack Burger King and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, a restaurant on the Volokolamsk highway was fined 50 thousand rubles, and the establishment in the Greater Tul Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after eliminating all violations.
43 appetizers have broken the requirements for the arrangement of the premises.
Among other disorders of unsatisfactory sanitary and sanitary content of the premises, failure to comply with requirements to the ventilation device, in some establishments there have been identified bacteria of the intestinal system.
The franchise on the Burger King brand belongs to "RuthRus" owner of the chain "Sokoladnica" by Alexander Kolobov, in Russia works 293 snack.
Igor Artemyev, Head of the FAS, said that the agency was against an index of 10% of the tariffs for cargo transportation and the provision of state subsidies, as the Russian Railways woke up.
First they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and a multi-billion dollar subsidy from the budget," he says.
We say: It's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, refuse expensive mansions, football teams, own TV, stop wasting your money left and right.
He added that the FAS had its own, "far more stringent" proposals now being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible variant of net calculation with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of executing the put-option at full amount of $300 million, said gold mining company.

Sumeru has a time until October 3 to implement an option or request a surcharge.
Details of the negotiations in Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was concluded within the purchase of Polymetal project "Kyzyl" in Kazakhstan.

Minpromtorg: Address food aid will not be equivalent of cards in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, Viktor Evtukhov, said that the program of food aid would not be the analogue of the card system of food distribution which existed in the USSR.
It is about modern food assistance to the population and support of an effective domestic commodity producer.
I ask not to speculate on the phrase "food card."
I would like to emphasize that we should not confuse the offered products cards with the echoes of past times of total deficit, card system of distribution, with which the number of received products is normalized.
We have yet offered the concept if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation," TASS quotes Mr Eutukhov.
Previously, Kommersant wrote that the programme for the introduction of food cards for the poor is brought into the government.
More on the initiative of Ministry of Industry and Trade read in the material "Kommersant" "Igor Shuvalov instructed to prepare food cards."

Vice-President of Russian Railways (RZD) on corporate security Alexander Bobreshov leaves the company, Interfax reported, referring to the source.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich said that the issue of the withdrawal from Russian Railways Alexander Bobreshov initiated the new head of the company Oleg Belozerov.

In the current year, the study of the Russian Managers Association "Top-1000 Russian managers" goes out in the 16th time.
As an instrument of evaluation of the professional reputation of Russian managers of the highest echelon, the survey summarizes the work of Russian managers for the year, revealing leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates is the winners of last year's rating.
The winners of the last year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate of the current year and put members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list of candidates propose to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, which would be appropriate to add to the common pool of candidates.
It is possible to move the following heads of functional directions of the company: Finance director, commercial director, director of marketing, director of staff, IT director, director on public and corporate relations, director of relations with authorities, director of corporate governance.
Each offered by the experts will be invited to participate in the rating and are given the opportunity to present their management team and up to ten new leaders from other companies.
The selection of the candidates on the industry principle is carried out on the basis of branch classification of the Association of Managers: Information technologies, commercial banks, forest and forest processing industry, machine building, media, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant will be provided with login and password to access the site www.top1000.amr.ru where they see the information about other participants and can set their evaluations on the criteria for each functional direction.
The principle "The best choose the best" is based on the methodology of making a rating: Top managers estimate the top managers, functional managers assess functional managers.
Such principle allows to obtain maximally authentic evaluation of the professional reputation of colleagues.
Final results of rating are approved at meetings of expert commissions.
To the table meetings of expert commissions are invited all wishing candidates of the current year and multiple candidates of the rating of the previous years.
The commission is organized according to the function: The Commission approves the list of top managers and eight commissions on approval of the leaders of functional directions.
At meetings of expert commissions it is proposed to approve the presented lists in alphabetical order (the places are kept strictly according to the Internet appraisal and are classified information prior to publication of the rating) or make actualizing their adjustments according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms "Kommersant."
At the time of publishing the rating can be changed in the status of managers and companies.
The comfortable rate for the loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the credit market for small and medium business in January-April of this year woke up to 40%.
What is your estimated situation today?
After the panic of the end of 2014 - the beginning of 2015 volumes of credit volumes to SMEs decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: A sharp rise in interest rates.
Lending under 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
If previously, the bank could lay down all its possible problems in the future, from late to return, it is impossible to do that: Bets and so on.
For business the current level of rates on credit of SMEs is not comfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.
A 10-13 per cent rate would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and form an attractive yield on them.
How does your estimate be satisfied with the demand of entrepreneurs for loans?
The situation changed slightly after the Central Bank was lowered.
Credit resources have become more affordable.
However, according to our observations, customers began to ask for loans much less frequently.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects of its development and future income.
Today one way out of business: It is necessary to learn how to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and region.
More closely follow current results, control the movement of cash.
At the same time, if financial resources are available, new technologies will be used to modernize equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All this ultimately allows the company to make products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends of credit market development and will affect its development until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for lowering the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the central bank, and now the regulator is demonstrating the consistency of lowering the key rate.
However, the radical decline in credit prices for SMEs is not worth it.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes the necessary interest rate for real income.
Moreover, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even at the lower rates of the Central Bank.
Given the level of delay, small and medium-sized business companies, which are limited to both replenishment of funds and alternatives to correcting economic behavior, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
It is so written the word Mazda Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautifully, lacklustre and at the same time it is rather difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
So also the new crossover CX-5, as well as any other model of the brand: Without being prepared attractive outside, technically perfect inside.
Japanese, simply by virtue of its "japanese," can bring affection to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to the state of total delight.
It is possible to make arguments in favor of cars from other countries, and a person even in principle with these arguments will agree, but the whole conversation is sent away from the final phrase: "But it is a Japanese car!
And argue not about anything!
Such people should probably love not only the technique, but also all other Japanese.
To quote from the turn of the main, to give food of wasabi, to collect the catana and to dress his girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but on the canons of a street Japanese fashion: Nice, creative and quite unexpectedly.
Perhaps the Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls wear with pleasure and after graduation.
She has amazing qualities: Both sensual and strict.
And the girl older, the skirt is shorter.
The main change in appearance of CX-5 is a resoluter of a radiator with five horizontal lines.
But it is much more difficult to change the shape of the car with a new drawing of headlights and rear lamps, which the car will see instantly in the flow of the machines.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the appearance of it is filled with the rigs.
Call the police won't have to.
Behind the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, one can experience only a stoic Japanese calm.
The diesel engine of the volume of 2.2 l provides high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the power unit is exclusively automatic transmission and full drive.
Black shoes, black cloak, black bag...
To add to this image a bit of black humour, you can choose leggings with the princess from the police tape Not Cross.
However, the Mazda made a maximum effort to get the CX-5 at the place of its own accident.
To further enhance the comfort, while maintaining excellent manageability, the suspension has been redesigned by the front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the front lower levers.
The system of complete drive is adapted under Russian conditions.
Traffic noise from the road and the engine at high speeds reduced by 13 per cent.
A swimsuit or stripper is as dull as a budget sedan.
Otherwise, if the girl smashes in a swimsuit with the original pattern.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of a role-playing genre.
Attention to it then will be less than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved construction of both the front and rear seats, which provides the optimum margin of space and for wide shoulders, and for long legs - who than possesses.
Another long-haired will appreciate that the upsides in front of the central tunnel are now soft and don't beat on the ankles in the vibe.
The widest range of Mazda's active security systems is offered on the CX-5.
To recognize the potential threat, radar, lasers and cameras are used.
There are adaptive lighting and warning signs and monitoring of dead zones and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best luggage in the classroom.
A comfortable one with a minimum of exits, it holds a weight of 561 l. The seat seats are folded in proportion 4: 2: 4 - each section is equipped with a separate lever - and it increases the luggage compartment up to 1560 l.
The hero cartoon costume in Japan is called "Quigurumi."
The kigurume-pajama is especially true.
It's all about it!
Of course to sleep.
But still - to entertain young children.
Or just wandering around such a beast on the street...
After all, it is so great when you have the ability to choose - cool clothes, manners of behavior or a car.
Thank you for the help in preparation of the ship Kawaicat.
Kiev broke the atomic ounce.
Kiev officially issued a refusal of Ukraine from cooperation with Russia on completion of the Khmelnytsky NPP.
The High Court of Justice on Wednesday agreed to cancel the agreement with Moscow after the second attempt.
The contract for the third and fourth blocks was signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to start the project.
On Wednesday the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine passed a law terminating in 2010-2012 agreement with the Russian Federation on construction of the third and fourth block at Khmelnytsky NPP.
The draft law was passed only after the second vote, and by the first time it was supported by 210 deputies at the necessary minimum in 226, but then when the project was overshadowed by 234 members of parliament.
The Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant, which was established under the original project, was to have four coal-fired power stations with reactors of the VVER type, but had only managed to build two.
Negotiations with Moscow over the completion of the Intergovernmental Agreement ended 2010 in 2011-2012.
Because there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was supposed that building blocks would have to be paid on the credit of the Russian side, but the funds were not allocated.
After a coup in Kiev in February 2014 and following this cooling in the relations between the two countries, Kiev began to collapse relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing the refusal to cooperate in Khmelnytsky NPP and on a project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only sphere where relations have survived has remained the purchase of fuel for Ukrainian nuclear power plants (have provided about half of the electricity generation in the country) as long as Ukrainian NAEK "Energoatom" will replace Russian supplies of different types.
The plans of completion of Khmelnitsky NPP with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet refused: As early as 2014 in Kiev announced negotiations with Czech Skoda JS.
United Nations General Assembly against the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon during the news conference said that it was impossible to settle the situation in Syria by military means.
"Military solution is not," writes the AP his response to the issue of Syria's military support from Russia.
Ban also announced that he will hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the UN Security Council, later this month.
"The meeting will be over Syria," he stated.
Earlier today, Russia's Deputy Chief of Staff, Nikolai Bogdanov, said General Staff did not rule out the possibility of establishing air base in Syria.
There are no plans yet.
"But anything can be," Mr. Bogdanovsky said.
Earlier, Kommersant reported that the United States did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who requested that military assistance to the official Damascus would be necessary to fight the terrorist group banned in Russia by the terrorist group Islamic State.
The Russian military presence in Syria concerns Washington's "Russian military presence in Syria."
In the PA, the OSCE reports on a possible meeting of parliamentarians in Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, Artur Gerasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting later this year with the Russian parliamentarians to discuss the situation in the southeast of Ukraine.
"What I know: There is a definite meeting this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," TASS quotes Mr. Gerasimov.
He also called for the implementation of Minsk agreements and "returning to normal life of our countries."
The question of whether or not the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in "normal" or in the format of the contact group at the OSCE PA on the OSCE PA - Mr. Gerasimov observed that the dialogue was held, there were Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the policy, in Kiev supports any kind of dialogue.
Earlier a representative of Ukraine on talks, ex-president of the country Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics have not yet changed their positions on the trilateral talks, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties split the mandates.
Yesterday the election commission of Nizhny Novgorod presented the results of the elections to the city Duma by the municipal district, distributing 12 deputies, party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the elections came from representatives of the CPRF who have accused the voter of "covering falsifications."
Opposition comments were not accepted.
At the same time the party rejected the parties "Communists of Russia" in the organization of a referendum concerning the abolition of the fees for the trolley of the apartment blocks.
The city election officially presented the results of elections in the city of Nizhny Novgorod on the municipal election district.
A total of 1.03 million people were included in Nizhny Novgorod.
More than 11,500 ballots were accepted, and 24 were lost.
12 mandates for political parties were distributed, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia," six seats in the miners rely on Dmitry Svatkovskiy, Dmitriya Krasnovu, Vasilii Shapoanov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Ryabayev and Igor Nagorny.
Communist Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky received the party's only mandate.
Two Commandments of the CPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanyan and the Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of "Justice Russia" are distinguished by Alexander Razumovskiy, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyukhin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must determine whether they should work by deputies in the urban arc: In case of a refusal from the mandate, he goes to the next party candidate.
The chairman of the mining committee, Alexander Makeyev, told members of the commission that it was on duty for the "dispatch of telegrams to Zhirinovsky and other things" on the subject of refusal of mandates.
At the adoption of the protocol on the results of the elections, the CPRF representatives declared multiple violations.
A member of the miners' party with the right of deliberative voice from the Communist Party, Leonid Krasnokutsky, suggested not to acknowledge the results of voting on the four constituencies # 21-24, pointing out that at the orders of the Head of Administration of the Sorpol district the entrance to the building of the administration, where four district commissions were located, was closed.
Within a long time the deputies of Gos, neither the candidates themselves, nor observers, but the resonant scandal with the assault of the gates of the administration were shown in the TV.
At the meetings of the district commissions all observers and members of the commissions with the right of deliberative voice had an opportunity to attend.
They stopped access only when the vote ended and did not yet visit the precinct commissions to hand over their ballots.
This was done with the aim of preventing different provocations.
"Then the chapter amended, and at all meetings the interested persons could attend," the member of the regional committee Natalya Andrsyshina said.
The Communists objected that in a blocked building of the administration more than four hours were unlawfully detained by Lyudmila Aristov, who was in charge of what was sent to the investigating committee.
The opposition was also outraged that in a number of UICs on the election day began to seal the urn at 6-7: 00 a.m., laying ballots for the ballot in them.
However, no one alerted members of the board to the right of deliberative vote and observers, so they came to the beginning of election at 8 a.m.
The Communists are sure that in the morning hours before the opening of polling stations in the Urals they could defy the ballots.
However, the mountains already examined more than 124 complaints about different reasons, according to Alexander Makeeva, there were no violations with the vings of unaccounted ballots did not find.
It was not supported by the members of the commission and the proposal by their colleague of "Justice Russia" Maria Popova through an obliteration of regional legislation to clearly set the time for the opening of envelopes with the ballot papers, which then fall into the urn.
"In the course of their own initiative, go to the CEC," suggested Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the Communist Party, Sergei Samokhin, collapsed at the end of the meeting, shouting that he ignored dozens of complaints and covered electoral fraud.
"You're not here at the rally, excuse me!" the chairman of the election team offended.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
The first meeting of the City Council of the Lower New City of the sixth convocation will be scheduled for September 27.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the municipal election commission denied the political party "Communists of Russia" in registration of the initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to discuss the Nizhny Novgorod residents two questions: Whether they agree with the fact that the fees for the capremont of apartment buildings should be "immediately repealed" and tariffs for housing and utilities services "freeze till 2020."
However, the lawyer of the city Irina Maslov explained that the circulation of "the Communists of Russia" was contrary to the law.
FedEx's revenue is a mixed character, declining forecasts for 2016
FedEx reports on the disappointing results of the last quarter, and the giant of the delivery service has reduced its forecast for annual profit due to falling demand for freight traffic and the growth of costs in its land transportation division.
The company also said it planned to hire some 55 000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that hiring 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares slipped by about 2.5 per cent at the preliminary bidding for 45 minutes before the exchange opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it planned to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in fiscal year, which ends next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts estimated at $10.84 according to the FactSet's review.
The decline in the forecast comes despite a rise in rates averaging 4.9 per cent, which will come into effect on January 4, and the growth of fees for land transportation of heavy or overall cargo, which begins in November.
The company said it was still planning an increase in revenue compared to last year thanks to spending cuts, increased gross revenue and the growth of online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company had "worked steadily on account of the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and world trade."
Labour's hiring plans for the holidays were announced the following day after the competitor's statement, UPS, of plans to hire an extra 95 000 staff, roughly as much as they took to work last year.
For the quarter, which ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, a 6 percent increase from the year before.
Earnings per share were $2.42, close to the forecast at an average of $2.44 a share held by Zacks Investment Research overturned 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a slowdown in the sector of urgent international travel, resulting in a lack of gross revenue growth in its express transportation division.
However, the boom of online shopping has dramatically improved the results in the FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from land transportation grew by 29%, but operating income remained unchanged due to higher costs for large departures and self-insurance.
The express transport division has received higher revenue because of higher base rates, while in the freight sector, income has fallen because of increased labor costs.
At preliminary bidding about an hour before the opening of the stock, FedEx shares fell $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 percent for the year and a 17 percent decline following a record of June 11.
At the most anticipated for a few years, Fed chief executives will spend two days this week at a 27-foot-high table from the Honduran red tree, deciding whether to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At one end, the richly decorated room for meetings with a height of two floors above them will be a wall image of the United States.
This card is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chair Jenet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the country's economic interests above all others.
The central bank received a double mandate from Congress: To maximize employment in the United States and hold stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the heads of the Federal system have recognized that there is a third, unsettling assignment: Financial stability.
And that third order may prove to be an unknown factor in the near-predictive decision that will be announced Thursday, about whether the US economy is prepared to break away from the risk-free stimulus provided by near-zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show a steady rise in the economy, recent turmoil in the world's financial markets may hold up and so cautious Federal Reserve officials from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important consideration," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the rate, increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait for further," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Federal Reserve will do, which itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast an interest rate rise this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to keep it off, with a key indicator showing only about a 30-percent chance of a rapid rise.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal system raises the bid, provided those making the decisions do not soften the blow by the promise that the next increase will be an accident.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The takeaway was provoked by expectations that the incumbents of the Federal system would leave a bid this week," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It will be a surprise if the Federal system increases rates at this point in time," he observed.
If the Federal Reserve's leadership is so, "they will have to go far in the approval of their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don't panic."
Other experts objected that the rate rise could ameliorate financial markets because it would remove uncertainty over how the federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal system seems inclined to raise a rate of 0.25% this month, making the first small shuffle in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could prove the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen claimed in the spring and early summer that she expects to raise rates this year despite complaints from the Liberals about the need for greater economic progress.
Although the emergence of new jobs in August has slowed, labor market growth has been stable this year.
Unemployment has shrunk to 5.1% last month, which is the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost to the level that the Federal system considers to be full employment.
Wage growth shows signs of acceleration.
And, while inflation continues to be below the target at the annual rate of 2%, the Federal System Administration said that the key reason was the temporary effect of the sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the shrinking labor market," said Ian Scheferdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world became shaking at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The average Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 16% relative to record highs in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy could drag world growth.
The market has partially reinstated its position this month, and the Dow Jones industrial average is now about 10% below high maths values.
For the Federal Reserve's management, the outrage of the market complicates the uncomfortable calculations of the rate of interest rate increase.
"In the absence of information on what happened in the financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks they would have turned the screws on that meeting," said Steven D. Oprah, a senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve student.
It is now predicted that they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
"There is greater uncertainty about what implications for the U.S. economy and they have almost no credible data after recent events in China," Oprah said.
The health of the world economy is not included in the main concerns of the Federal system, and technically it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.
But essentially the Federal Reserve has become a global financial authority.
The Central Bank's impact in recent years has been huge.
One only hint from then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "mute" its monetary expansion, sparked turmoil from markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined with each other, one might expect that Fed policymakers will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more an art than science," said Zakari Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global crisis management strategies.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve there were cases of overreaction on the financial market movement, which appears to be not related to economic principles."
Lacker, a member of the right voice of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, insisted on raising rates as the example brought the decision 1998-99.
The Asian financial crisis has led the Federal system to lower its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three sessions, "regardless of limited identifiable consequences for growth in the US," Mr Lacker said.
A year later, the heads of the Federal system cancelled these declines.
The Federal Reserve should put on the first place a concern for stability only in times of major crises, such as how the market crash in 2008," said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the interest rate committee at Bank of England.
The final panic and close did not come close to that level, he said.
"You would, of course, don't want to be in a situation when you are frightened of the rise in rates because the markets are experiencing a shock," said Pozen, president of the Peterson Institute for Peace Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should be ahead of events.

Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin admits that the US is deliberately destabilising the situation in the Middle East to wave refugees to Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed his opinion to journalists in Ulan-Bator as part of the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a supporter of Conspirological theories, but the question is by itself: Whether or not Europe is the ultimate target of those with such manic persistence in recent years has destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East?" he asked.
"For sure, someone assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these poor and destitute people, who are saved from death, will go to the welfare countries of the EU," he added.
Naryshkin wondered, "Many political leaders in Europe have been frank about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that are now literally overthrowing their country?"
"No, old Europe, for the rare exception, prefers to keep quiet," he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO is infecting many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe is, unfortunately, for a long time and unrelentingly creeping up and cracking down on how the war boots, seeded by NATO standards, rasters and moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law," the speaker stressed.
Government forces and loyalist militias are opposed by the rebels, consisting largely of Islamists.
Later on the opponents of the Syrian government joined the banned terror group Islamic State.
The US supports the rebels who oppose both Assad and Gaddafi.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The president of Syria has called the cause of dislike for the West to Russia.
The West's claims to countries like Syria, Russia and Iran are the fact that they are sovereign states.
Such an opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, First channel, "Russia 24," NTV, "Russia Today," TASS, "Interfax-'' and "Russian newspaper."
Assad said the West does not perceive partners and sovereign states.
In these countries he would like to remove one person and place the other, which will act in the interests of the Western countries, not in the interests of their Motherland, he noted.
Assad has been paying attention to a sharp turn from the Western media since launching a coup in Ukraine.
In his words, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "turned from a friend of the West in an enemy, a king, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, which has come to power by the undemocratic way, despite being elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West."
Putin called on the world community to combine forces with Assad to fight against "Islamic State."
Commenting on persistent claims by the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the people's consent, through elections, and if it leaves - on the demand of the people, not by the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference, or the Geneva communiqu√©.
"If the people want him to remain - the president stays, and otherwise he should go away," he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded them of cooperating.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking of military support from Iran, the Syrian leader observed that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He refuted claims that Iranian military units were sent to Syria.
Tehran supplies us with military equipment.
"Certainly, it has a place of exchange by military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange was always carried out," he explained.
As for the rest of the states, we are open to cooperation with any of them with a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We don't see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-gambling coalition led by the United States," Assad pointed out.
The number of dead has exceeded 230 thousand, and the number of refugees is 11.5 million.
Part of the territory has captured the terrorist group Islamic State, banned in Russia.
An international coalition headed by the United States deals with IS positions with air strikes.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: The Chechen
Us Secretary of State John Kerry has conducted a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to State Department spokesman John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not present any details.
In doing so, he said, the US has tools for "further isolating Russia" if it supports Syrian President Bashar Assad, RIA Novosti reports.
As reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov again emphasized the need for a united front to fight in the territory of this country by terrorist groups.
The ways of settling the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tension on the Korean peninsula were also discussed.
Moreover, some issues of bilateral relations were affected.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern over the rise of Moscow support for Assad.
Washington said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be further isolated from the international community.
In response, a spokesman for Russian President Dmitry Peskov said that the country would not be in international isolation.
The rebels are bracing for toppling Assad's regime.
Part of the territory has captured the terrorist organization "Islamic State."
An international coalition led by the US puts the IG's positions on air.
Boroday called the information of the American newspaper slammed on Strelkov.
Former chairman of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Boroday refuted the information, which was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said in a telephone interview to "Lenty.ru."
A note in the Washington Post is fine because there are no longer passes.
The former Defense Minister Igor Strelkov, naturally, did not bind and "went out" from the territory of the Donbass republics in a very high mood, without faith, without three rubles of money which are ascribed to him by different characters," he said.
According to Boroday, the issue of Strelka in a conversation with a reporter of the American newspaper actually went.
"Yes, I was saying that Strelkov was urgently required to remove from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former head of the National Bank of Ukraine.
Boroday stressed that he was not aware of why an American newspaper correspondent had decided to write that the shootings were taken to Russia's "related" territory.
I suspect it is a provocation.
If that's not a provocation, it's a surprisingly misunderstood word because I emphasised that the shooters had gone away," Boroday remarked.
"It is slander to me, and on Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier in the pages of The Washington Post there appeared an article in which Boroday's words were given that he had exported Strelkov to the territory of Russia forcibly.
According to the publication, Boroday said he had been forced to tie up his associate.
The Polish authorities began to search the train with the gold Nazis.
Polish lesions have begun to cut trees above the underground tunnel, where, according to some data, the train is with the gold of the Third Reich.
The works began on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reported.
According to military experts, clearing up the forest is necessary to check the validity of the rumors of a railway composition with treasures.
Inside the train can be the equipment and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the Polish governor of Poland, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence of the existence of a train with gold was not even more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to settle the search area.
Three days before, Poland's deputy culture minister, Peter Zhukhovsky, stated that local landowners with "probability of 99 percent" found the train with the gold of the Third Reich, which the legends say.
Zhukhovsky said that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels will be discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, and the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In the middle of August, two clients of the law firm appealed to the authorities of the Polish city of Valbos with a message that they found a train in a tower tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narrator of the Russian Federation has proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons up to 21 years.
Russia's chief narrator proposed to ban the sale of tobacco before the age of 21.
Evgeniy Bruyn noted that until this age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - is particularly pernicious."
So he said in a live broadcast radio station "Speak Moscow," commenting on the information that Speaker Sovfdine Valentina Matviyenko supported the idea of banning alcohol sales to citizens under the age of 21.
The man rips unevenly.
To serve in the army at least 18 years, the person physically to that is ready.
Mentally he is ready for full life in society from 21 years.
"It is known from the scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry will finally be ripe for only 21 years," explained Bruce.
An earlier member of the Public Chamber and the "sober Russia" project, Sultan Hamzaev, told Izvestia that Matviyenko supported the initiative to raise an increased price during the sale of alcohol and "agreed with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again on the site of the upper house of parliament."
According to the activist, a working group will be established in the Federation Council to draft a bill under the direction of Matviyenko.
The Bible was asked to check the law on the information protection of children
The Republic of Novosibirsk applied to the regional prosecutor's office to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "On the protection of children from information detrimental to their health and development."
The author of the complaint stated that on August 26, 2015 was acquired in the "Read City" store on the Red Avenue of the Bible, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book he discovered fragments which, in his opinion, violate the federal "About the Protection of Children from information causing harm to their health and development."
On September 16, the application was approved by the prosecutor's office of the city of Novosibirsk.
The answer to the resident of Novosibirsk will be completed within 30 days.
The bottom line is not to ban the book.
It is more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself.
Moreover, it is a very basic problem that there is no society.
It will start re-reading the Bible, which has not been done before.
Brazilian union of babysitters Rio Grandi promotes healthy eating for breast-feeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has invented a scandalous method by which to persuade women to breastfeed during breast-feeding: The method involves a demonstration of images of babies, soya breasts, painted images of the harmful food.
Breast milk includes various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates from which children receive all nutrients needed to form a strong immune system.
Due to high energy needs, pregnant and native women are encouraged to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one increase in calories is not the only change of diet that mothers need to do.
In a recent study carried out by Robert Watershed, Professor of Medical College London, Texas, it turned out that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents them from developing their tumours.
Unfortunately, there was a negative effect of unhealthy eating on the immune system of the child.
Under Hamburger the train pushed the school bus.
Near Hamburg, the train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on the railway track.
The 23-year-old female driver, having realized he could not move off the tracks, ordered 60 pupils to leave the vehicle.
And in a minute after that, they had a collision on the eye.
His video was ambushed by one of the schoolchildren.
There was panic among the students.
Some children started crying and running along the sidelines.
The route is still blocked.
No one was injured but one passenger of the train received light injuries.
The damage from the crash was estimated at 300,000 euros.
Doctors are urged to ban boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local sportsman David Brauna-Young.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in the match with the Philothian Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles on the version of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended in the 12th round.
Brown was taken to hospital with a turkey injury.
His condition was evaluated as a critical one, and he was connected to a life-support device.
On the professional ring Brown won 22 victories, only two defeats and one fight ended in a draw.
He had two children left.
It's already the second case of a flying outcome among Australian boxers for the past six months.
The 23-year-old student Brad Smith died in March from injuries sustained in the ring.
The AMA now recommends not to engage in this sport, and it is better, from its perspective, to ban it altogether.
"I understand that this is happening to me," said the organization's vice president, Stephen Phernis.
But in the form in which there is now a boxing, there will always be situations where an athlete gets a haemorrhage or a brain injury, leading to death or serious injury.
For this reason, Inglis believes we cannot continue to live with that.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that unites practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin called on OSCE PA to revoke sanctions against Russia's parliamentarians.
Russian State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin called an unacceptable imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He stated that he was speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulan-Bator.
We assess this as unacceptable actions as an offensive on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And that should not be repeated because it is a manifestation of political oppression and ignoring the principles of open international dialogue," the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin urged OSCE members to re-establish a partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let us believe the morality of politics.
Let us understand the dialogue and the right to practice international communication.
Let us believe the humanistic ideals in the democratic world order.
"The twilight has never been good enough," he said.
Speaking from the podium of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian Duma called for parliamentarians to call the Inter-Parliamentary contact group in Ukraine.
I urge the members of the Assembly to concentrate on the following specific tasks in security.
"First, to solve the Ukrainian crisis by negotiation and immediate convocation of our inter-parliamentary group," Naryshkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be given due consideration.
"This is almost the only place where it is still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
Recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulan-Bator and will last until 18 September.
She was waiting for a couple of days to celebrate.
World athletics champion Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called triumphant for a 24-year-old light-athlete from Barnaul Sergey ShUBENKOVA.
He succeeded in his coronial distance 110 metres with barriers to win over Europe's team championship, set a few records, and most importantly to be a champion of the world, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprinkler.
Besides, recently the athlete won the final stage of the "diamond league," having occupied the third place in the common place.
New Izvestia asked Shubenkova to share his impressions of the outgoing season.
Sergey, season for you is not finished yet?
Yes, I am going to speak at the World Military Games, which will be held in Korea, and then I will be thinking about the rest.
The truth is that we will prepare for the house, in Barnaul, and to be at home - it is still a different state.
Everything is easier than every week to be driven around the world.
You somehow said that autumn is a favorite time of the year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a great time.
The passion after the main start of the season boiled down, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
One can laugh at the pleasure, at the "comfort."
Plus you know that and the holidays are very soon...
And the fatigue is there?
However, the season is special, there are lots of positive emotions...
Fatigue by the end of the season is always piling up.
And then it was not important what was doing more - winning or playing.
Every contest is stressful.
Permanent flights, overriding - all this does not take place for the body.
Tired physically and emotionally.
But now emotions I have, of course, are on the rise.
Yeah what's out there - I'm just happy!
By the time you finish the World Championships in Beijing, returning frequently?
Sometimes.
And you, journalists, don't let me forget it.
But in general I think that bad sportsman who lives old victories spins his successful races over and over again.
I was waiting for a couple of days to win - and have to move on.
The preparations for this remarkable season were very different from the usual ones?
I can't say that there was something special.
We started preparing again in December, but the winter competitive season I missed.
He was training first at home in Barnaul, then at the assembly, then again at home.
All as usual.
But with the coach set the task: Try to get to a new level at which I have not yet been.
Almost every winter has spent to lay the base.
There was a bunch of crosswords, and the exercises on the mediated preparation, which included both traction and the maid, and the back we shook.
Then he started the barrier training, there was a lot of technique.
For how are the contenders being watched?
I always try to do it, good in the era of the Internet with this no problem.
He looked at the winter European Championship, and the French were in the barrier.
Thought another: You have to do something, dilute this company.
With each start this season you have added and added in the results.
Was that made sure?
I have all the latest seasons in the same scheme.
There is no such thing that I run first 13.20 and then it's 13.50.
Always roll out my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was to run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was directed first of all to this result.
But there is a paradox in the sense that I feel that I am ready for feats, and in the competitions to show their readiness it is not always.
What was it, for example, at the London Olympics?
I, if honestly, the semi-final race (Shubenkov couldn't get to the final - "Nose") tried to forget at once.
He was very good, really could run out of 13 seconds.
Yes, even if he had repeated his best result at that moment, there would be a bronze medal winner.
But unlucky.
Your first World Cup remember?
What about it?
In Taiga it was.
I wanted to get to the final, there was such a maximum program.
And took off straight from the loose, in the preliminary scoring.
Then he realized that to turn and to fall to the head of the head did not mean to go away at all.
In two years at the World Cup in Moscow has already come out in the final with the best time.
Well remember my feelings before deciding: Very much wanted to win "gold"!
How is it possible to develop decent speed, not lose another head, not to turn off?
And that is the most difficult thing.
You need to be very careful, focused on technique not to roll down barriers.
I noticed that when you configure it not for the result, but the process is so much easier.
And the most kitsch when you have a feeling that you are fleeing and all as if it is itself!
A fair word, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depths after the first serious successes seek to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever had such thoughts?
The house is still better.
And I can't imagine where I am without my trainer, who do I need?
Maybe it would be good to have conditions better, but I try to be happy with what I have.
C Klevtsov you've been together for a long time?
From the age of 12, since, in the light of athletics has come.
More precisely, at first I was training at his wife, who worked with the children, and then she handed me over.
I started with the sprint, then in the long jump, triple.
The children's multi-story was when they put the ball, jump in length from the place...
In 14 I tried to run with barriers and I liked it.
At the same time, it turned out to be under the norm of the second adult discharge.
That's how it stayed.
Fear of the barriers has never been the case?
Somehow managed to agree with them.
But the technology always had to work very much.
Beat over one crush of how much tormented!
But there is no escaping from this routine.
The technique should be cleaned constantly - so that at night I could wake me, I stood up and ran through the barriers.
Anyone who saw your fence in Beijing claim it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I loved it, too.
Normally I don't reconsider my race, and I couldn't help.
But the efficiency needs to continue to operate - no limits to perfection.
Don't be afraid now that the victory for the year before the Olympics will be a burden on the shoulders?
As they say in such cases, I will try to justify expectations.
Once you choose this road, you must go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat it: If you're not weak, no extra cargo should be felt.
And I absolutely agree with him.
Otar Kouanashvilli
Well, not so much I'm naive to me in amazement with the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are appalled, I understand, their bread is not the bark - give, lead the enemy.
And though the flag I didn't sit, and the same thing, a million times spoke here, and the bastard didn't call anyone directly.
All my pseudo-mobs, in a moment, have evaporated.
The pressure I have been subjected to is so strong that even I who saw the type of guy, I think that people are being belted out.
As if I walked myself, I walked, and you were attacked by the crowd and muttered with rods.
But it is necessary to know me, I am not a room eagle, I am a fist, I from the howitzer, old I, guys, to be afraid.
The other thing is, no support.
I have no illusions, but now...
The best in me has always been self-sufficiency, so get out.
And giving passports to such as Fred Derst or Monson can only be given.
Better for me, for better journalism, work is not fair.
A week ago in Kiev Otar Kouanovashvili, in sharp shape, characterized the Crimean events:
What made with the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is what it calls the annexation.
I believe that a reference to the way that Khrushchev has tried to sign something has been tried to sign up and in no way fits into the general picture of a human hostel.
It's like coming to a neighbour and picking up his vest...
The war out of the Kremlin has gone, and will end it only there.
I am 100% confident that, as in the summer of 2008, it began with a call of some bastard from the Kremlin's stalled.
I have assumptions about who it could be...
The Cobzone is not so much to live.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he what the apartment will lose?
Well, if it was a monument.
Of course, people will remember him as insulting his small homeland.
And reconciliation now depends on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Sedys leading in the rankings despite Channel Nine's attempts to shine on losing leaders in Today Show
The departure of Karl Stefanovic and Lise Wilkinson to Canberra for coverage of the fallout from the Liberal Party's announcement about the release of the leader failed to raise the ranking of Today.
It was broadcast from the capital of the Republic after the defeat by Malcolm Turnbull Tony Ebbot.
The contestant - Sunrise - with leading David Kohl and Samantha Armitage, has been stuck in London under a week-long series of international broadcasting, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture distance appears to have had no great value for Australian TV viewers, with Sunrise's audience numbering 397,000 viewers in the five biggest cities compared with Today's audience at 339,000.
Today it gained a bit more compared to its rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has reduced the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August Today, there were 318 thousand compared with the 330 000 at Sunrise.
At the start of the year, the gap has fluctuated between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise has 349,000 spectators against 314,000 at Today.
It was the most interesting thing that was happening all morning.
Winds of change affect more than the Parliament this morning, guys!
Karl and Lisa in order, thank you for clarifying!

The important news for Seventh was an impressive debut of 800 Words with the former star of the series, with the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about the newly ravaged father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with their two children, drew an impressive audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics argued whether Thomson could handle the popular show alone, without star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday's evening is a loud response "yes."
The X Factor Seventh remained on strong positions with an audience of 1,136 million viewers, easily going down The Block (838,000) and tbl Families (726,000).
For Sediom, luck and failure in the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 17: 00 to 17: 30) the new TV presenter, played by Andrew O'Cife, collected 446 000 spectators.
The second half hour (from 17: 30 to 18: 00) the number jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGhielra (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of Chase Australia gathered 520 000 spectators, and the second half an hour - overwhelming 720 000.
Hot Seat collected 620 000 000.
The fall of Chase Australia's ratings for the second evening will force Nine quietly to admit that Hot Seat will still dominate 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which was not able to overplay the McGhayre show.

The three finalists are unanimous in that "bachelor" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?...
Lana Jevon-Fellouz, Sarah McKay and Sneana Markoski may have accidentally made clear who they would win in "bachelor."
The woman with whom Sam Wood will remain in "bachelor," is surrounded by mystery.
And three of them, of course, keep silence about who they received the last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snow Markoski and Lech Jevons-Fellza, on the eve of the day, when three girls would have to stay two, they might have made a hint of the winner.
Sam Wood steadfastly keeps silence before the final, which will take place on Thursday
All three women come into the lyric mood by telling why Wood is a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humour, determination, family values, cheerfulness as a cause for which each of them would be happy to become his companion.
But in their answers to the question "If not to you, who should get the last Rose of Wood?" they could unwittingly suggest, who had in fact won the heart of the "bachelor."
Jevons-Fellouz and Markoski didn't hesitate to call McKay the perfect pair for Wood.
Between Sarah and Sam, a good relationship has been established since the first day.
"From the moment I entered the number of participants, I felt the energy (Sarah) and Sam's energy and understood that they were very suitable for each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about that," Jevons-Fellouz said.
"Sarah is a very open person, with her is easy and fun," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, between them, there really is an attraction.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay believes that of her and Sam Wood will get a perfect pair.
McKay herself said that thanks to home dates last week, she realised that Wood was perhaps the "that person."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realised that this was not just the game - I had all my heart turned to him," she said.
When asked who should choose Woods, if it were not she, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
Both girls like the same one, and Sneana and Lana deserve it equally.
The show The Bachelor goes on Wednesdays at 19.30 on Channel Ten.

Jarvis Hawke had several options early in NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have been heavily interested after his move to the US - as well as a host of other clubs who have sent requests after an impressive open training session late last year.
But Hain chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and appears to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hawthorn on the bench of the spare for the entire remainder of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian league player has admitted for the first return of the pant in a winning game with Minnesota with score 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another opportunity to bring back the Pant, and also involved him in the game after Regi Bush's injury.
Tomsula appeared on the good side and after the game, in the dressing room.
Instead of making the newcomers in the presence of the team, he forgets them.
Tomsula also publicly backed Hayne at a press conference after the match.
A special reporter for the 49ers" 49ers Club Inman reported that Hain had also received support from the coordinator of the special teams Thomas Macgoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrod Hain lost the ball to return pitcher team "Minnesota Weibo" during the first quarter
At the start of his debut in NHL Hain and his numerous Australian fans clearly didn't count.
It was evident as Hain swore, going off the field after losing the ball and later he narrated the lead show "Heather and Andy" on the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which couldn't have imagined a more unfortunate start for a career in NFL.
"It happens, you just think about the next game and everything," Hain said.
Hain matched his team-mates with a debut in the 2007 Origin series when the throw of the ball in his relegation zone brought Queensland's try.
In the end, this experience appeared for a 27-year-old player very helpful.
Hain photographed with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a picture to Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested for threatening the use of weapons at the Siberian airport.
Having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his attempts to develop democracy were curtailed.

Some refugees are leaving the Serbian and Hungarian border on buses en route to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reports.
The authorities allowed the migrants to arrive at Croatian territory and to ensure their transportation from them to the country.
By the information of the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were hurt.
On September 15, Hungary's parliament tightened legislation on migration and protection of the border.
The amendments include the involvement of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who illegally crosses the border, as well as an accelerated procedure of consideration of asylum requests.
A Hungarian court has already admitted one migrant in an illegal crossing of the Hungarian Serb border, in connection with what he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian parliament soon intends to consider the transfer of Hungary's armed forces to the border of the country's parliament.
At the end of June, Hungary's rule began to build a fence with a barbed wire stretching 175 km along the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
Russia has admitted to the largest US cyber attack in history.
President Vladimir Drinkman, accused of Russia's largest cyber-attack, has admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, Reuters reported.
During the trial in federal court, New Jersey Drinkman confessed to conspiracy to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke of collusion with three Russian citizens and a citizen of Ukraine who are accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The combined damages of the actions of the accused valued at $300 million.
"Such responders like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to crack down on our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic wellbeing, personal life and national security," U.S. Attorney General Paul Fisher said.
Drinkman faces 30 years of imprisonment and a fine of a million dollars.
When the verdict is taken, the Court takes into account the recognition of the Russians and may reduce the term.
Drinkman's sentence will be released on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
Then another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was taken into custody.
The last of his guilt is denied by him.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk with the support of Russia's Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry, warned that Russian support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is exacerbating the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal against extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria by effective political transition of power," according to a report published on the U.S. State Department's website.
Kerry confirmed the U.S. commitment to combating the "Islamic State" group (whose activities are banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to Secretary of State, Assad "can never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also in the course of the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be solved by a political transition from Assad.
At the White House, they threatened Russia for isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
On the eve of White House press secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia for isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
Alternatively, Ernest suggested joining an international coalition that carries out an anti-terrorist operation against "Islamic State."
Recently, the media often report the presence of Russian servicemen on Syria's territory.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping the Syrians master the technique to use it against Islamists.
Four died when police opened fire to rubber bullets at a protester in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police began shooting rubber bullets into a crowd protesting against the country's proposed new constitution, an official spokesman said on Wednesday.
The violence happened on Tuesday in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishop Prasad Dakal, the head of the county police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters gathered at one of the police departments, some threw rocks and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dakal reported that police used tear gas, then fired into the air before hitting rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to be killed, are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, caused by such high mortality.
This clash was the latest in a few weeks of violent protests in the southern, flat parts of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi land claim that the new provinces, formed under the new constitution, reduce their political influence.
The protests also took place in the west of Nepal, among citizens of the nation tarnished who want to have its staff.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting at 10
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in the province, which has been a decisive step toward a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for several centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted for a draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise on 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970's, as a centre of chemical industry, has developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
On the results of the first year of work, on new projects and prospects, he told "Oblastnaya" correspondent.
Oleg Valerievich, what did you start working as mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of the audits of the financial and economic activity, initiated an independent audit examination of the expenditure of the local budget.
Then a revision of the municipal property was carried out.
One of the first practical steps was reduced document circulation up to five days.
Earlier, the papers were able to walk for months.
Measures aimed at raising income base and optimization of expenses were worked out.
In November last year, a government meeting was held in Saiansk, where issues of social and economic development were considered.
In the city there was no project-estimate documentation (PSD) on any object.
Without this, Sayansk was not allowed to take part in the federal programs.
We started with the preparation of the PSD on the roads, the kindergarten, the northern sewage system and the water supply.
Road work on the two sites is already underway.
How is the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation going to plan for the construction of kindergartens?
In July this year 105 children were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demographics in the city has not been observed for the last 27 years.
So the question of securing places in kindergartens at today is one of the most topical.
On September 1 closed to an overhaul of the kindergarten ‚Ññ 10, designed for 320 seats.
The cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has not yet received such funds.
Last year, the children's garden ‚Ññ 23 was opened, which is attended by 200 children.
The repair was made on the conditions of co-financing from regional and local budgets, its cost was more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the help of the regional government, the funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment were found, and the program "People's Initiatives."
There are plans to start in 2016 building a new kindergarten.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the status of children between the age and three and three years.
Queues for children from three to seven years old we don't have.
Are investors keen interest in the area?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be done first and foremost by the Sami enterprises, it is their necessary to provide work.
In October, a 60-apartment house for orphans in the Leningrad district will be put into operation in October.
As for construction, I added that Sayansk is one of the four towns of Priangarya, who entered the economy-class housing estate.
All necessary documentation is prepared.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In total we have announced the construction of 10 thousand square meters of housing wishing to participate in the program very much.
One of the conditions is that there should be no more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter.
If we deal with the specified volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
In his time in the territory there was a Sami holy complex, which in 2004 was sold for a price tag.
We are working with the prosecutors to question this deal.
The more so that the land under the object is in federal property.
Working with Moscow, it is decided to transfer 88 ha to the regional property, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor, ready to invest in reconstruction and launch of the project 1.5 billion roubles.
With the launch of a swinoa we will have 900 jobs, which will be a big contest for the city.
Is the institution of social partnership developing in Sayanske?
We have the order of 140 agreements of social and economic partnership.
Many projects were implemented due to active social position of representatives of business.
Considerable support is provided by enterprises such as Vostok-Center, Novo-Ziminskaya CHP, LLC "Sahyanskiy broiler," LLC "PC MDF," and management of these enterprises is directed at all appeals.
The company "Vostok-Center" carried out the repair of the convoy, where the specialists engaged with the children of ipateria, having spent more than 1 million roubles on it for more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to the sponsorship funds managed to manage the territory of the city centre.
Sponsors have helped colorful mark the city's Day celebrations.
As in the old good times there was a parade with the participation of city groups and organizations.
The city was released, the book of the Sami poets.
They were awarded the anniversary medals for the first time and to the people who have made a serious work contribution to the development of Sayanska.
The philanthropists also participate in the work of the city charity fund.
The first step was the acquisition of instruments for young talented musicians.
In the nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles are directed to support talented children, to help children who are in need of costly treatment, the support of children from poor families.
How are the social problems solved in the city?
There are not enough doctors and pedagile subjects in the city.
In order to solve the staffing issue, there is a huge importance for housing professionals.
Over the past year we have allocated five apartments for doctors, the service housing has received four teachers.
We have the opportunity to privatize it in five years.
The plans include redevelopment of the building, where eight more apartments for teachers will be built.
Teachers and doctors are also involved in the program "Jail for Russian Family."
In the future - construction of the house for the employees of the budgetary sphere.
Most importantly, the city has a workable team with which I can solve the most difficult questions.
It is important for all the crises to draw the right conclusions, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is large.
The Duma has introduced a bill on the indexation of social pensions in terms of price growth.
The State Duma introduced a bill providing for the indexation of social pensions annually from 1 February to the price of price increases.
The author of the document - a deputy of "Justice Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Rumanssev - is also proposing to perform an additional indexation of the pensions on April 1, if the rate of growth of the living wage exceeds the pace of prices for goods and services.
The indexation of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is made annually from April 1 with the rate of growth of the pensioner minimum wage in the Russian Federation for the past year.
The draft law, introduced to the lower house, provides for the introduction of social pensions based on the growth of consumer prices.
The first indexation will be carried out on 1 February and the second is held on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA stated Mogherini about the inadmissibility of the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the EU Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini OSCE PA Speaker Ilkka Kanerwa said the inadmissibility of sanctions against the legislators participating in the Assembly events was inadmissible.
A member of the Russian delegation during the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulan-Batore Nikolay Kovalev was informed about this.
According to TASS, there were signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives from Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece.
"There has already been enough powerful support," said Kovalev.
Earlier, he declared that the head of the OSCE PA had spoken with the intention of collecting the signatures of the deputies who pointed out that sanctions were not permitted in relation to parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev said, Kanerwa promised to raise this problem to the level of EU leadership structures and "send the appropriate petition."
The NHC reports that the likelihood of a cyclone to the south of the Green Mouse Islands is 60 per cent
A broad front area of low pressure, about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green cape island, has a chance of 60 percent turning into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, reported Tuesday by the U.S. National Center for Hurricane Center.
Another clearly marked area of low pressure around the middle between the Isle of Green Mouse and the small Antilles Islands also has a 60-percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reports a sinoptician from Miami.
Google launches campaign of doubling donations to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced a launch campaign of a doubling of donations designed to collect $11 million for humanitarian aid organizations helping floodlit European countries refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used an uncharacteristic personal approach, announcing a campaign to collect donations in his blog.
Instead the claim made one of the executives, a Google employee Rita Masood, who fled the family from Kabul when she was seven, described her personal experience.
"We got on dubious trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, plenty of people like my family desperately need help.
The donations will be donated to four nonprofit organizations engaged in refugees and migrants: "Doctors Without Borders," the International Rescue Committee, the Save the Children and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said it will double the first $5.5 million in donations, as long as the sum on the google.com/run eerelief page will not reach $11 million.
Europe confronts the strongest crisis with refugees since the Second World War, caused by much of the four-year civil war in Syria, owing to more than 4 million people this year.
Many also escape from the wars of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetic patients with little obesity can help surgery of obesity
A beneficial effect after surgery for obesity in people with little obesity, with type 2 diabetes, can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is now early to claim that diabetics with little obesity live longer after surgery for obesity than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The statistics of mortality manifested not at once," said Dr. Robin Blexstone, an obesity surgeon, who wrote about the new study in the editor of JAMA Surgery.
Surgery for obesity, or bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organisms to absorb food.
For several years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but basic research was conducted among people with morphine obesity having the body mass index (IMT) 35 or higher.
IMT, a measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal at value from 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above suggests that a person is overweight and people with IMT above 30 are considered people with obesity.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Min-Sheng General's Taiwan hospital have used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - shuning of stomach and elongated gastocomia, with a medical treatment of 2 diabetes patients with little obesity.
The average value of IMT among those undergoing surgery has fallen from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their involvement in the study.
At the same time the BMI of those who received non-surgical treatment from diabetes remains at about 29.
Among those who suffered the surgery fully cured of diabetes by 36%, and partially - 28%.
In a group receiving drug treatment, for comparison, the total cure for diabetes was only 1%, and a partial one - only about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure levels, triglycerides and "bad" LPNP cholesterol were "generally better in the surgical group," the authors claim.
The researchers also monitored the levels of haemoglobin blood cells that reflect levels of sugar in the blood in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c better hold below 7%," the researchers write.
After surgery the average level of hemoglobin A1c reduced from about 9% to about 6%.
In a therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, about 8%.
But the best indicators of glycemic control, reflected in good levels of hemoglobin A1c, have not reduced the death rate in five years, according to the head of research by Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average outcomes of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, in comparison with the band polled by a sleeveless touring band, the shuncing group lost more weight (18.7 kg against 14.2 kg), achieved a larger reduction of IMT (at 7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin versus (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was closer to the full remission of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not show the benefits of the surgical method in part of life expectancy after five years, there are confirmation of the results of a study of patients with an overweight body in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, as reported by Blexstone from the College of Medicine in Phoenix, the University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for people with obesity, who pushed the bariatric intervention, the chance to die for 15 years was about 29% lower compared to the group in which more traditional methods were applied.
Although the new study showed no increase in life expectancy, Blatter noted that it encouraged people with IMT below 35, interested in such a procedure.
"This report is very important, because it claims to be safe in a low BMI group where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease," she said.
Blatter added that people and their doctors should start to seriously treat the weight as a patient's BMI falls into the range between 27 and 30.
"I believe we take too long to get people to treat this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they have accumulated genetic changes that run into their bodies of obesity and diabetes, reverse is very difficult.
The robbers were taken away from the house of shulos and 9 million rubles.
In the Mytsa, the robbers attacked the residents of the near Moscow house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's shirts.
The press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation informs about it.
The incident happened Tuesday morning.
Two unknown assailants entered the house, located on the Gorky street, tied the 20-year-old son's house and, threatening both with the knife, kidnapped 9 million rubles and three shouts.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles.
Fans from Europe risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to place themselves as tourists, who in 2018 will come to watch the World Cup.
The rest of the hotel is not in a hurry to receive appropriate permission.
According to experts, this is a very worrying sign.
In the run-up to the world championship, the authorities urgently have to invent, how to settle all the guests of the city.
Rosbalta's interlocutors believe that because of the tournament the cost of renting the rented apartments will rise by 10-30%, and after the championship for removable housing will have to overpay.
The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the condition of the Russian hotels.
According to the law, under the leadership, each hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo the classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the stated number of stars and level of service.
It is now clear that it will not be possible to do so: Hoteliers are so worried that they often do not send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service on Petersburg.
According to the head of MFAS Vadim Vladimir, the department has studied 138 hotels and has now plans to have 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antitrust agents.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies has deceived citizens by placing a number of stars in advertising, noted Vladimir.
The problem is that there is virtually every room in the account, no one should be lost in front of 2018.
Officials suspect that during football championship fans will take all Petersburg hotels.
Now in city tourists can count on 30.5 thousand numbers.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 - two-- and three star hotels, 550 are one-star.
According to the First Deputy Committee on Tourism Development Nana Gvichie, at the moment classification took place only 23 hotels - so many audits carried out accredited in St. Petersburg companies.
And they ordered a similar procedure for regional enterprises, Smolny by surprise.
That is, there may be more or more classifications, but nobody knows about it.
"For the last six months, hotels have not been very keen to undergo classification," acknowledged the director of the North-West branch of the Russian Union of Tourism Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is explained by the high season, during which the hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to engage in other activities.
Another reason is the budgets that have not been put into account, and the procedure may cost the hotel depending on the status of between 30 and 100 thousand rubles and more.
However, at the last time the heads of the hotels became activated and began to apply for classification, wrapped Shadskaya.
Hotels must have time before July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but will also not get the right to work in the World Cup.
It is already known that depending on the star there will be a fixed fee for the hotel number at the time of the tournament.
The formulas on which the value will be calculated will be announced next year.
This is done in order to avoid a rise in prices by 200-300%, as it happens, for example during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
It is necessary to have a conscience and not to let the increase in two or three times, but also the hotels should be given to earn.
"I think growth will be up to 50%," explained the president of the Russian hotel association Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimir, in his turn, is not sure that the fixation of prices corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I do not know the extent of the economic theory, but I hope that this measure will be justified.
"It's better rampant appreciation," he noted.
It is unclear what will be with popular cheap hostels.
The Duma deputies introduced the bill, according to which hostels should be banned in residential houses.
We are very hopeful that this law will not be accepted or will not be related to St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that the hostels have to be preserved," Nana Groves said.
However, it said owners of mini-hotels should be prepared to tighten the Housing Code as soon as possible.
If the Duma approves the bill, approximately 80% of the hostels will be approved in St. Petersburg.
According to the president of the Association of restaurateurs and hoteliers of the Northwest Leonida Garbar, there are no two - and three star hotels in Petersburg, who are in demand for football fans, but there are retracts in the side of hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is analogous to the situation when "there are 75 thousand vibe sitting in the 80-thousandth stadium."
This can be corrected at the expense of mini hotels.
Their possible ban by the expert considers "idiocy": "It seems odd that some people live in the flats, but the visitors cannot."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, I agree that's wrong.
But if as a hotel to which guests come for a short time, then why not?
Mini-hotels are at risk of skipping the World Cup and because of their nervousness.
Whole hundreds of small hotels simply do not have time to go to the classification, with the foundation of their own.
By the summer of 2016 the work will be done by all the hotels of the city.
"Companies that can carry out this procedure are not so much, so they will give away less paid orders from the mini-hotels, and will choose those that are being undermined," said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities such as Moscow and Volgograd, the test scores at the moment are much higher than in St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is related to the permanent battles in the tourist bloc of the government, which does not contribute to the coordinated work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels do not have enough, which will most likely have to pay attention to regional hotels and recreation houses.
For example, in the name of the 300th anniversary of Petersburg the city can mobilize the river fleet, i.e. the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will prepare themselves for the furlongs in which it is possible to sleep.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels, so that they are empty," Gennady Lamshin said.
It is also very popular during a football championship to enjoy the use of removable housing.
Most likely in the city will create a reserve of removable apartments.
Rent rates will rise by 10-30%.
"From the obvious - the first will leave housing near the stadium," said a specialist in rent of the Agency for Development and Research in real estate Larisa Bragin.
And the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in bed areas.
It will contribute and build new transportation solutions on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
We should not forget the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people do not simply tip the road, but can also take a mini-excursion.
There are complications as well.
My dad in the 1970" s met a family from Murmansk - a father, mother and two children.
It was difficult for them to sleep: The hotels were difficult to sleep at the station, and they were hard to sleep at the train station.
"And the pope brought them into our communal flat," he recalled.
However, he added that there are now no such features in the city residents - calling for themselves home is fraught with consequences and frightening.
But maybe in 2018 after the failed Duma decisions, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to be remembered?
Zhirinovsky "merged" the Amur region.
With admiration, today I looked at Zhirinovsky's clown in the State Duma.
He did things when our generation was still only learning to trade newspapers, and is still in fine form.
The topic of the speech seems to be "the LDPR protest against election results in the Amur region."
The protocols are not trickling - for nothing; other protocols other than the signed electors, the LDPR apparently does not.
Here he raises the second place Ivan Abramov and shouting something like: "Here is the winner of the election!"
And then, at the same time, you get to the Motherland, and then, after the quagmire already with the chairperson, will put the faction out of the boardroom, with the how-to of you, literally, "You are all with the fronts of your jibs and lice."
The press, of course, focuses not on Abramov but on the scandal and the demarcation of the faction as a result of this scandal and insults.
In reality Wolfenovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region along with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is a further rise of Zhirinovsky in the style of "pods!" rather than a protest of the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction is formally posturing, and the election, if the Party of the Party and Feysbeth Ivan Abramov, is not recognized, is not recognized, but the leader with the theme obviously tears.
He gives the dead to Amura himself to bury his dead, and he is preaching against "United Russia" as a whole and in nothing else.
A graceful solution to both the face is not to lose, and in real, rather than a show scandal not to go.
The other thing, now in a strange situation, is Abramov himself.
Apart from the howling of his superiors, he did not wait to see the protocols, and there are no other protocols.
He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for a narrow circle - he has become a formal cause and for the abuse of a respected champion, and that is even more abrupt, the Hammam drops in the address of ER and ONF.
And then he, of course, should seriously consider what to do.
Because of the main beneficiary of the election, the politics number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 on the only regional single-mandate county it can turn into a pariah that has successfully enjoyed its own party leadership and super-irritant for that of the ONF and party leadership alien.
That was not to be Zhirinovsky, he should have come to think and respect him.
Trump is yet to grow and grow.
It has emerged that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary.
That is, the bath has fallen at all.
It is the only subject of Abramov under a cellar.
Beautifully indeed.
'It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe' - the Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists has called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama touched on the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Centre for Mercy's compassion at Oxford, a devoted to the research of ethics, at the start of its 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that in the existing circumstances the interests of mankind should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while that is the cause of admiration, the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria over the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of thousands of refugees is fine, but simultaneously you need to think and about long-term solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries," he stressed.
After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of homicides in their countries.
We need to weaken the use of force.
The use of force never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the US's harsh response had launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in the letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is possible through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force and that caused the unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-times rise in the number of children who have swallowed a disinfectant for their hands, for the last 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States reported an almost 400-percent increase since 2010, the number of children younger than 12 years old, swallowed by a disinfectant for the high alcohol content, as reported by the University of Georgia.
According to Dr Guy Lopez, director of the Georgia toxicology center, cases of screening of children up to 12 years of fluids for disinfection of hands reported by toxicology centers increased from 3266 in 2010 to 1,6117 in 2014.
"Kids contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately some percentage of them are sent to the ambulance unit," Lopez told CNN.
He explained that some children drank disinfecting fluid specifically, and some do it to impress their friends, or on a dispute for social networks.
On the Youtube videos, you can see the teen drinking disinfectant as a cheap drink.
The teen was reportedly mixing a disinfectant with a spiral of liquid to strip the mouth to get a more potent drink.
Younger children can be attracted by pleasant smells of disinfectant fluid.
"The child doesn't think it could hurt him," Lopez reported.
Many of the most endearing (disinfectant liquids) are those that are flavoured.
There are disinfectant fluids for the smell of strawberries, grapes, orange, which are very attractive to children.
A resolution of 50% of alcohol per hand contains between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol.
Small children, particularly a handful of sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is a spiral of high concentration," said Fox 4 in Kansas City Dr Stephen Thornton, chief physician of the toxicology centre at the University Hospital of Kansas.
You wouldn't leave just so tea with whisky, but people keep up with these disinfectants for their hands, and if the kids are up to them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Naidge Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently at school swallowed a disinfectant for a hand with a strawberry flavour in a number of roughly four sprays, was sent out for treatment to the ambulance unit.
Alcohol levels in her blood were 179, twice as many as an adult, who by law is considered to be in a state of alcohol intoxication, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie - a doctor of an ambulance who treated her in a Gwinnett health centre near Atlanta.
Naidge putted his words and could not walk when she was taken to the ambulance station.
Doctors watched her all night at a separate children's clinic to miss any signs of brain injury because of the alcohol girl fell and hit her head, Ritchie said.
"It was very scary," told CNN's Ortoria Scott, Naigi's mother.
It could well prove fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use non-piercing substances or disinfectant napkins, in addition to the readings to remove disinfectant fluids for the hands of children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are linked to the deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after being swallowed by a disinfectant that contained the toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol - a lethal agent rather than ethyl alcohol - which was listed as an existing substance.
In January, three apprenticeships in the north of New York conspired to poison their "anti-inflammatory" teacher by "spreading antibacterial substances into the classroom," according to a police report.
A teacher has a strong allergy to a disinfectant for her hands, and she has banned keeping them in their classroom.
Police believe the failed plan was "empty conversations," and addresses questions of discipline to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the benches at the entrance to the stolen children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya sad owl owl.
Babies who come for books are trying to feed her chocolates.
Several generations have gone to this library for 95 years.
The earliest readers in the twenty years of the last century organized loud reading, staged performances under the verses of Mayakovsky, conducted literary quiz and corresponded with the wife of Lenin.
The correspondence lasted four years and, as the newspaper "Young Stalinets" wrote in 1939, every day a "friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of the children's library of Barnaul" became stronger.
The hope of Konstantinovna was even sent once by a distant barnacular to friends his children's photo.
And when the barnacles asked if Hope had not objected to the library by her name, she wrote that no, there was no objection.
The letters have to be explained for a long time in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain, whose strict profile is decorated with a bas-relief on the building of the library.
During perestroika times often called different people, outraged: Why does a child's library not be renamed?
Let it be a library of some good children's writer, without political coloring!
The staff of the library sat, they thought, and decided to leave it all as is.
"Krupskaya" is probably the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul as "leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - a track from the yellow brick.
"The magician of emerald city" is the favorite topic of the artist Oli Moskovka.
Before Ol was a manager at law company, coming to work at eight, had gone to five, and from all the other managers differed only by love to drawing.
And then found an ad on the Internet: "We need an illustrator for the book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy."
Oulla made illustrations, and thought: Life can end at any moment and there will be no miracles in it if you don't create them.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books of writers all over the world and creates fairy tales.
It is traditionally believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But some reading children go to see the children, and their parents understand the meaning of reading.
In recent years, we have had such a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and it will live - the kids who go here!
I think the interest in reading comes back.
In the lobby of the library there is a large exhibition window with updated photo exposure.
Once in a quarter there are new pictures of readers who go to the library with all family: Mom, dad and children.
In the library we are glad that with the children it was increasingly coming to the Pope.
If in two years the child had read the whole Chukovsky, at the age of older he needed books to be more complicated.
But now there is a law on which an eight-year-old surfer is prohibited from giving books out of the category 12+.
To receive such a book, the child must bring with them parents - they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them something like a family club.
In the library there is treasures - prerevolutionary collection of bulls with the atons and ers, by the novel of the King in the annex to "Niva" magazine, "Murzemakers" for 1936.
In fact, we are now open to the movement, we are trying to become a special place: Not home, not work, not school," explains Tatiana Kachiva.
To us it is possible to come to all to read, play, break.
We have made the game for the kids - the child comes just to play, and the wheel is still drawn to the book!
Some of our readers are sick, and they fall with knives, they don't want to leave.
Often come mom with a stroller - and we are pleased that the library they put on top place among all the other places to come with babies.
Tatiana Kushina says: Modern children are the same as we once love classical children's literature:
"The publishing business is developing, and much attention is paid to the authors who are the link between the generations."
And if you talk about small kids, it's important for them to be some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like partying with their heroes.
The library is constantly releasing booklets for parents, which describes what is going on in modern children's literature, which books worth paying attention to and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that the adults are interested in, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden to make books outside the reading hall.
This magical privilege is only available to children.
... In the most distant room of the library there is a square one with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, in the book guard.
The steps will be sharpened under your steps - it is already a very old machine of time.
From the book of my childhood you are met, as with an old friend: Hi, good that we are not changing with you.
Ellie all so much fun walking along the road paved with the yellow brick, the ribbon of the Toll of the bewitches the magic matches, and Malchish-Kibalchish never told the cursed tempts of the Military Mystery - such that he has a firm word for him.
Books like passwords can be found in any place.
There are in the repository and real books of redness - for example, pre-revolutionary collection of bulls with the atons and ers.
Or to lead the King in the famous annex to Niva magazine.
Or the "Murzemakers" podcast for 1936.
The time runs out of the page, split them into a teaspoon.
These publications are not presented to these readers.
This fragments of our future collection, I all dream of - will retire and go with rare children's books.
But the kids on it already, so to speak, will not tell: And the paints in old books are not very bright, and themes... open the first page, and there - Lenin, party, Komsomol.
Now it seems: Why did we all write this "pioneer truth?"
But everything was interesting," said Galina Iowsova, "The Russian Planet," the head of the book shop.
Murzkoff pages have darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilyevna has headed the bookkeeper for the rest of his life.
She knows the colors of the Buratino skipper, in which academic year Harry Potter was the captain of the Griffindor team at the Kviddich team, in which Carlson uses a glitter for a motorist, and by whom the father of Alice Selezne works.
The librarian's work pays little, and anyone who can live without these book ranks is very quick to find another profession.
Only the most persuasive: Enlighteners, pedagogues, service members of the book's cult.
They can also be learned by smiling - it is considered that it is a professional feature of children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of conversation was a professional.
I really like children's books: As a librarian, I like them to be so beautiful and beautiful on the shelves, and I love them to read them," says Galina.
I read everything: Military, historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.
Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think, in my childhood, everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of everything that happened to me.
And as I madly loved them, it seemed to me that the library was a magic place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope that the books will always be, despite the freaks.
And I rejoice when our former readers bring the children, and the grandchildren...
Mill rumours: There's no disagreement in Selticism
Griffiths refuted talk about the controversy in Seltica after the Dave's recognition that "Hives" is in a bad position, but he would do so.
Hoko will protest against the Scottish Football Association's claims to Neill, and Warberton fears signing contracts in January that could disrupt team unity
The "Dons" increased the advantage before "Seltik" to five points
Penny Adam Runi in the first half gave the "Aberdeen" a slight advantage over the "Hamilton" at Pittodrie, which allowed the Dons to break away from Seltika by five points.
Griffiths refuted talk of controversy
That sparked rumours of the controversy in the Selfika, which was tackled by Griffiths, who claimed he and his teammates don't suffer any heightened criticism, preparing for a meeting with the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we're feeling the tension, I believe the players are keen on it.
Dutchman is bored because Scots are not in the fight for the title - de Bur
The former midfielder from Rangers and former member of the Netherlands defender Liz de Bur has claimed Dutch football fans have lost interest in Seltics since he is unfazed by the Rangers' title against the Rangers.
De Bur, now an A-League spokesman, said: "In the Netherlands no longer shows the most attractive moments of the Selfica games, and why?"
That's because there are no Rangers.
People here speak not only about the return of Rangers.
They talk about "Old Firm."
They talk about both teams together and that's what their interest is.
In the games of the Old Firm lot of tension, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Deila
Ronny Deila admitted that "Seltik" is in difficulty, but the Norwegian coach has vowed to change everything.
For a defeat by Malm√∂ and, as a result, the exit from the Champions League was soon followed by a losing 10 of Aberdeen football players, who are now relegated to five points, ranked the top of the table.
But Deila declared: "Selitka" had bad periods before and we would go out again."
Now we want to get out of it as quickly as possible.
I understand that it is very unfortunate, and many people are very, very angry or upset about what is happening.
And we too, but we need to continue.
And we really, really need the support of Seltika because from that players get much better.
It is so important to stay together now.
Warberton with mistrust awaits January transfer
Despite the opinions emerging just a couple of weeks ago, suggesting that he has identified some of the goals of the January transfer window, Rangers boss Mark Warberton with distrust relates to the January campaign, claiming he does not want to disrupt the team's unity.
The former Brentford attacker declared: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in summer, you have a period before the start of the season for their adaptations that you have and seen in our own group this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes, more damage is done by adding unwanted players to the ones you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in "Seltik," hinted at the completion of his career.
Suonsey's forward Mitch, linked with the Seltik during the transfer window, hinted he could leave the football after completing his contract with the Swan.
The 29-year-old has suffered from ankle problems for two years and has not been able to leave Wales this summer.
Harts gather to confront SFA over Nate Myles' claims
"Harts" led with a score of 2: 1 when removed Paterson, and began to lose 3: 2, but the red card defender was later cancelled; it was Collum's third red card, annulled for eight months.
Neilson disclaims his words, claiming: "I have not questioned ethics, I have not commented on the game."
Griffiths has vowed to avoid Taipei
The stubborn player of the Hayberbatch player has received a reprieve after admitting that sang the song with offensive words about former Harts player Rudi Scacela.
The incident happened at a pub in the Rhode Island area of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh derby on Tyneside in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was hot," said the attacker, adding: "I can confidently say that I was not going to return to Tyler if he did not play for the Seltik.
Donnelly: Council Tannadis confident of "Dandi United" management
Simon Donnelly argues that the board of directors of "Dandi United" is still confident that a team of managers will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration in the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the guys to go out again," Donnelly said.
Macinnes glad 'unbeautiful' won at Henmilton
Derek McInhope admitted his team Aberdeen had to desperately fight against "Henthorn Assis" to achieve a seventh consecutive victory in the league's primary league, which put them in five points above the "Seltika," the top of the tournament table, thanks to the penalty of Adam Rundle in the first timeout.
Mak-Inure said: "There is no such team here, which would have something to win - the Cup, or the league championship, who did not win a meeting in the same way."
Unemployment rate among Scots does not change, while in the UK as a whole it is growing
Unemployment in Scotland has remained at the level of 164 million for the period from May to July, while the number of disabled people in the UK as a whole has increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate, 5.9 per cent, was above the United Kingdom's 5.5 percent rate, as figures from the National Statistics Service (ons) showed.
At the same time employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 in three months, with the number employed now being ¬£2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland declined for the quarter to 74.0% - above average figures of 73.5% for the United Kingdom.
Scottish Labour MP David Mundell, commenting on the most recent figures, noted: "The Government's long-term plan has laid the foundations of a strengthening economy."
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over these 12 months we have seen a further improvement in Scotland's labour market while increasing employment and reducing unemployment.
Why I am a witness to the executions in Oklahoma
Today, dodging legal interventions at the late stage, I'll be looking at how to execute a man.
If that happens, and I hope I still don't, I'll be sitting on an observation gallery on death row in Oklahoma City, when Richard Glossip will be executed with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
For the first time this request was made as early as January, through his close friend, and although I was tapped into shock, I agreed.
With the approaching of this day I became afraid.
So, why should it?
I agreed as I thought it was a good way to tell detailed story of the death penalty.
That would suggest a unique race.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend the executions in America, and, as those who wish often more than seats, the results of the gloomy lottery decide who will be selected.
In Oklahoma, the number of media outlets reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected, he will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'll sit with Richard Glosser's closest friends and have a relationship after several months of phone calls and one visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration argues that I can't be simultaneously a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I will have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me of being biased in my impartiality.
That's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, get access.
I had complained to her.
She recognized that she herself "could have been better prepared to formulate," but still believes that I am not right in what I do.
Richard Glossip did not agree a lot with what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he had spoken.
I told him that he could dismiss me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants a journalist of international publication to be present to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that glasnost will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Belinda, a reporter from the "Haffington Post," will be with me.
If you want to know more about this, listen to podcasts that I have recorded.
I won't go into the details again.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of an accomplice to the crime.
But I believe there is a high probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for a fatal sentence was not enough.
I believe his execution is flawed.
And from that radar I'll watch him die.
I cannot claim to be fully objective.
There will be other reporters for whom to apply.
From me you learn what it is - to look like the person I like, dies without necessity.
The man who was persecuted by police was persuaded to climb out of the Canning River
The constable of the town of Kavaning-Weil managed to persuade the man to climb out of the Canning river, and to remain dry.
A resident of Perth intended to walk away from the police but failed to get stuck in the dirty water on a shallow water several metres away from a police officer trying to "gently persuade him to come ashore."
The police of Kanning-Weiala were called on Tuesday after illegal penetration of alien territory in the Bakings.
When police spotted the suspect, he tried to walk away from them, throwing at Canning.
But far he has not been paid.
"He was standing in the water and saying "I won't go out, let's grab me,"" Senior Sergeant Chandell Kasdashian told reporters.
I didn't really want to urinate, so he used a safer appointment - "negotiations with good police."
"Sometimes people do odd things to try to escape," says Senior Sergeant Kasdashian.
The Football champion of Ben Kazgles was exactly that and he remembered.
In 2006, Kazins moved to a caucus to avoid a meeting with a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to refloat Suit.
His efforts proved to be in vain, but made local residents invent the "biathlon of Ben Kazinsa."
Peter Moody accuses stun guns of trying to spy and threatens to withdraw from horse racing
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria in an attempt to introduce a spy at his concoction last year and threatened to immediately leave the horse racing.
He was targeted by stewards and operations manager Racing Victoria, whom he accused of orchestrating a campaign personally against him, and the removal from the start of Lady Tatai because of violating the rules of application of medicines on the start day, on Wednesday, was the latest straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always applied all the efforts by participating in the races, and he was in a difficult situation when he was talking about the positive result of Lidari's test of cobalt, which he could not explain.
He held the tongue on suspicion of espionage for a year and a half and did not want it to "look like green grapes."
"I wasn't going to talk about it for a long time, but sometimes you get that out of your knees, which is no longer deterred," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes react and then you have to survive the consequences and I'll have to live with what I said.
Today I will go home and be able to sleep.
I want to walk high with my head and want my owners to know - I do my best for them.
When they start thinking that's not the case, then I'll need to stop being a coach.
Then I will have to think what to do with my license.
Earlier, Muji sensationally declared during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stables.
"A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dave Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat down in a room with the man I called, if asked, and offered him a job at my horse in order to transmit information about what I was doing at my horse," Moody said at Racing.com.
They clearly believe that I'm a fraud.
If that is true, they should surely be given the claim, as trying to catch them has failed.
Robert Rolleston, former chair of RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondri, the RVL executive director, knew all the time and know now.
Shouldn't it make me think the case is becoming personal?
Should the RVL be emboldened and called to account for what is happening in this business, other than the coaches?
Is I bad for this profession?
Is I bad for this profession?
Maybe people out there think that's the way it is.
Maybe they need to take away my license and push me away and I have no doubt - what I am now saying can make them think about it.
But I have reached to the point where I still do, and it is my sorrow.
I'm really sad about it.
I will put pressure on them and charge them for making a decision.
I have the support from the family and I can leave.
The coach of the coach only grew up in the course of a long investigation of the case with cobalt and Lidari, and the final removal of the horse from the start forced him to claim that he could "shave his licence off the table."
Mudi, most famous for having prepared the undefeated champion Blake Craven, called the demands for the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition "laughable" after the horse's leg was dealt with a commuters of clay, which is a violation of the rules.
This is a violation of rules for downloading.
"I have to take full responsibility for that," he declared.
One of my employees mistakenly made her kompress on the foot.
She could get a composting last night.
She could get him yesterday as it was.
She was with him on the day of the score.
Moody may be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition for use of the compressor, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who create these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need the rules but it has gone too far," Mudi said.
The driver who carried out the attack and who was hiding from the scene of the crash in Kobram was arrested
Police arrested a man who drove a motorbike in Cobram and was hiding from the crash site.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne's Hospital with serious injuries after being knocked out by a car at the Murray Wellings Arena on Saturday.
Police said the driver had left without stopping to help the injured motorcycle.
The 50-year-old resident of the city of Nottingham surrendered to police in Shepparton on Monday.
It is alleged that he will be charged with leaving the scene of the incident, inaid and in violation of other traffic rules.
A motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy parades accusations of rivals in applying tough security
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called the criticism of an interception of the ball by his team as "imposing the agenda" by two of the NRL championship favourites.
Sydney Rusters coach Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storma to "fight" with his team during the Storma's sudden victory in the final qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett has made a clear hint at "Storm" after his team won the final qualifying tournament at Nozern Queensland Steelers" night on Saturday when he called the game "typical" for league rugby and claimed two Queensland players were not "too successful" in the manuscript.
Bellamy secured an interception of the ball by his team and claimed they were simply focused on "touch," intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he has instilled the criticism of his team by two leading coaches, as it means their worries about possible defeat by "Storm."
"It continues to pop up - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talk about the tough receptions when they beat us with a score of 24: 2," Bellamy announced on Wednesday.
I can make sure that we have not changed all year in our systems or security technicians, just in the last six weeks we have paid special attention to contacts when intercepting the ball, and it has become a turning point for us.
Trent there has already been three years and he's clearly training an excellent team, so he's probably not used to losing, and for him it's got some shock.
It's funny how that always shows up at this time of the year.
Bellamy joked about Bennett's idea of "impressive football," having reminded his teacher that "St George Illawarra Dreizons" Bennetta won the championship in 2010, showing "boring" football.
Wain talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and see how impressive their game was," Bellamy observed.
I remember that in 2010, St George "had a lot of criticism, calling a boring team, and Wayne said that he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers as impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It's football in which you want to play when you have such players.
He made that remark in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two such a midfielder like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can so play.
It gives me more confidence, because they are saying these things because they are a bit disturbed by the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they reached the big games.
Bellamy also noted "Storma" and "Rusters" were a contest with more points than the Broncos and Kauboz.
The Broncos" game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game he was 20: 18, there were two more tries - and what, is it and does impressive football?
Or consider impressive breaks and failed attempts?
For me it's a rut.
If they mention it, it means that at some stage we can meet them there.
The Storma at the end of this week's holiday, as they won the right to host either "NRL Queensland Steelers," or "Kronalla Sharks" next Saturday night for the preliminary final at AAMI Park Stadium, tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Accused of possession of drug serb released on bail of $200,000
A man who faces life imprisonment for attempting to assign 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland will be released on bail at $200,000.
Marco Maximovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after a federal police discovered 100 kilograms of the drug on a Solay yacht coming from South America via Vanuatu and bound for Kumir in August.
During the morning, Maximovich and his accomplices saw on the marina, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found a 40kg drug in a Toyota Echo car.
In spite of the fact that Maximoviƒá faces a life sentence for attempting to impose narcotic substances in the amount sufficient for sale, Mr Maximovich's lawyer claims that evidence that the latter tried to win the entire party is absent and that the man could be in the cafe without any intent.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flecaghan doubted that Maximovich was worth bail.
The latter has ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about the location of his residence.
Mother and stepfather Maximovich were asked to contribute a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.
"From the testimony of both it is apparent that the amount of collateral of $200,000 is for them too much a financial burden," Judge Flecnagan said.
But one measure is not enough as a guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovich was allowed free bail on condition that he would deliver both his Australian and Serbian passport, would be celebrated by police daily and abide by a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Photis Katesaris: "I am proud of the Greek national team, which was over the last few seconds."
Greece's head coach Fotis Katicaris gave credit to his team after the match 1/4 final of Euro 2015 with Spain (71: 73).
According to him, the game's fortunes have decided individual mistakes.
It was a big game," said the AFP of Katicararis.
We were preparing for an excellent game in the performance of the Spaniards.
Tried to work in the defense, but the defense mistakes determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Friland: "In CSKA, I will be assigned the Clive functions."
Newcomer CSKA Joel Fryland said he did not believe in the curse of the army.
Also the British have expressed confidence that his new club will be able to break the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I've spoken to coach Dimitris Itudis a few times this summer and, in fact, after I joined the team, "R-Sport" Frashed.
Yes, I will need some time to rebuild the centre-side position, yet in the NBA I played more forward.
Now I will have to confront a bigger focal point, but I have already done so, so I think, and now I'll fix it.
The Warriors last won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then, they've beaten six times before the "Finals of the Four," but there they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
There is an opinion that a team someone has glimpsed.
In this whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course it's difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now and if we are going to show the best that we are capable of, then we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
Always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have already won in the tournament and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the eyes, I am not a superstitious person and I do not believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you connect those two things, anything is possible.
I don't have any particular rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "For me the match with "Romo" will be special."
Barcelona coach Luis Enrique did not hide that he returned to Rome for the match of the first round of the group tournament of Champions League with "Romance" with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the wrestling match of his current and former team will become a far cry for him.
It should be reminded that Luis Enrique trained "wolves" in season 2011/12, but did not manage to show himself on the best hand in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome after a few years, for which gained a certain experience.
I am extremely fond of warm memories with Rome.
It's going to be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with victory.
The August meeting at the Yana Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the near match.
I expect from the "Romance" of the game, which she showed in Series A against Juventus.
It's a strong team that is capable of pressuring and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Scochenko: "Krasnodar" has different variants of attacking actions."
The acting head coach of "Ural" Vadim Skrychenko in the run-up to the match of the 9th round of the Premier League with "Krasnodark" noted the variety of attacking schemes of the opponent team.
According to the mentor, "bulls" have in their arsenal a few models of the game in attack.
The fight will be held on September 21 and will begin at 16.30 Moscow time.
As will be played with "Krasnodar," still look, - gives the official site "Ural" of the words Skripchenko.
We have a week of preparation ahead.
This team has different options of attacking actions, versatile conduct your attacks, at the same time and we team is not slow, so I believe there will be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that "Krasnodar" is held to match the Europa League against the prerecorded Borussia Dortmund, will try very well to win.
Roer Kannac: "Astana houses "can take away points from anyone."
The Champions League midfielder Rosh Kahja has expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
At his field astanians are able to take away points from any rival.
In spite of the fact that the match was hard for us, I can say that we were playing well.
"Benfica" above the class, but in the home match, I think we can expect to take away points.
It's quite real.
But first you need to think about "Galatasarae," and then "Atletico."
In the home matches we can take glasses from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "Just how many things you can do: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Rebels coach Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with the major victory in the match of the first round of the Champions League group tournament with Shakhtar (4: 0).
The specialist has given credit to Krishtian Ronaldo, who has become the author of three heads.
The match was not easy, because Shakhtar was able to own the ball.
The rival did not have many points, but their counter-attacks were always at risk.
I will not say that "Real" played an ideal but bare opportunities we had had enough.
I'm pleased that we haven't missed the balls and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll repeat it so many times.
Georges Alba: "Krispy Ronaldo can't match Messi."
Barcelona defender Georges Alba believes that with his one-club Lionel Messi no one will be able to match.
According to the Spaniard, "Rebels" forward Krishna Ronaldo, too, cannot do so.
Messi on five heads above the rest," said Le Figaro Albu.
Even Krishna Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field all changes, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniel De Rossi: Barcelona has not only a unique style but also bright individuals.
The semi-defender of the "Romes" Daniel De Rossi, on the eve of the match of the Champions League group tournament with Barcelona, noted the importance of compactness and subinsurance in the game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, beginning at 21.45 Moscow time.
Let's remind, "SRES" will conduct its text broadcasting.
"Barcelona" is a special competitor, a good team with excellent players, - quotes the official site of UEFA De Rossi.
With blue-granite it is difficult to play, because they possess not only unique style but also bright individuals.
To leave them, we'll have to smell for the duration of the match and banish each other.
Messi is almost always successful when it comes to water, so we need to save compactness and organization.
They hope to go out in the starting lineup of SKA in the match with "Glory."
He said that he hopes to go out into the starting lineup of the Warriors in the next match of the KHL Championship.
The Aussies hit the ice instead of Mikko Koskinena in the 23rd minute at 0: 3 and reflected all the throws on his side, SKA's fourth goal missed after replacing the goalkeeper with a sixth halfback player.
The next match will be on leave against "The Word."
I hope to get out in the next match in the starting lineup, - puts "R-Sport" the words of Eugene.
I am not an expert on goalposts, I am a goalkeeper, we don't have a missed goal, so it's difficult to track.
Dynamo has played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team still lost.
I'd better miss more, but the team won.

Sturt Hogg used the girl's phone to get pedophiles to send photos
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of child abuse.
Sturt Hogg took the girl's phone while she slept, registered on the internet messaging service, where he received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found a missing phone and found it in the arm of sleeping Hogg.
She checked him and found the shocking photos, and then immediately addressed her mother's attention.
Police arrived and saw five images, followed by computers found at this address, and discovered "relevant" queries in the search engine using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then told police he had done so because it could "attract pedophiles" and then he would "pretend to be a policeman to frighten them."
An authorised judicial officer, Einkey Robertson, told the sheriff's court in Dandi: "He claimed it was an addiction, he was addicted to frightening people.
He admitted to making requests for the computer but claimed it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to frighten the pedophiles.
He was interviewed over a conversation with an unidentified man who sent him an image and tweeted he was asked to send still photos.
He said he was doing it to lure them away.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drunk and claimed he wanted to see images of rape and homicide.
MS Robertson added: 'When the girl found the photos on the phone she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw indecent images on the phone and then with the accused had been held.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used the computer and a "Pioneer" to talk to the girls who looked much younger.
Hogg, 23, from Waze Road in Dandi, pleaded guilty to the charges in the manufacture of indecent photos of the children on 14 June last year, violating bail conditions on 25 January this year and failing to appear in court at a hearing on March 24 this year.
The defendant's lawyer Gregor Sim applied for his petition not to add Hogg to the list of persons who had committed sexual offences, because it was possible to prove that there was no "significant sexual element" in this crime.
Sheriff Alister Karmichael deferred sentencing until October, before receiving medical advice from social services.
Hogg was released on bail on the case, however he was taken into custody pending a hearing on other remaining cases.
He was brought into the list of persons who had committed sexual offences before the sentencing date.
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe reads no speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest state leader, earlier this year fell from a ladder leading up to the podium.
He wasn't hurt, but a video of the scene of the fall instantly spread across social networks.
The opening of parliament was also overshadowed by the allegations by parliamentary opposition members that they had received anonymous threats, alerting them from the sanctioning of Mugabe in the wake of the appeal.
A month ago, they sanctified the president during his appeal to the nation in parliament; Mr Mugabe's speech reiterated Tuesday.
A member of parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Insuent Gonhese, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The message has come from a number that is not displayed, but it is entitled "Death,"" he told reporters at the end of Mugabe's speech.
Noted by members of parliament it warned that privacy would end up in the parliament building and once they go out, parliamentary immunity does not act.
A member of parliament said that the party, headed by Morgan Cignirai, was "concerned" by the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring programme and lower service costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard is divided into two registered companies, separating the production of computers and printers from more rapidly developing hardware and service operations.
Deductions from the expected job cuts will amount to an estimated $2.7 billion since the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Uitman, Chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard at present, and the portfolio of business will be wider and deeper, which will help move the company into a new style of business," said Uitman.
As a standalone company we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing requests of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and "will focus on providing previously unattainable complex technological solutions" to companies, the company said in a statement.
This is divided by a company formed in the 1930s by graduates of Stanford University Bill Hughes and Dave Packard for the release of electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto nicknamed "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley."
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a large-scale reorganization with the purpose of transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
Such a move by HP, the world's second-largest manufacturer of personal computers and one of the largest tech companies in the United States, is the newest event in this sector, based on the confidence that narrow-minded companies are doing better.
Arsene Wenger's captain Mikel Arteta says his one-club players should support the injured Jack Wilshire before playing with Dynamo Zagreb
In conversation with Wilshaw, Hungary also stressed that it was only September, and that, provided that Wilshire's recovery was going to be done, he would not be prevented from returning to the game for Christmas.
At the very best of events, Wilshere will certainly miss at least four more England games and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains under consideration.
Hurt just in this recent challenge that Wilshere confidently finished the previous season with the only injury to his ankle and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Hungary: "This injury doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not until the end of the healing bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just circumstantial.
This is not related to the ankle or injuries he has had before.
These may be related things from a medical point of view, but as the Hungarian admitted, there is a similar risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an adverse trend.
According to Premier Records Ltd, Wilshire had 23 different injuries sustained in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he has played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 games in the league over the past five seasons.
If you look at the split for Arsenal wide, you may notice that in six of eight seasons starting from 2007-08, Arsenal have been one of the two Premier League clubs, on account of the most missed due to injury days.
The Hungarian admits the likelihood of being stuck in a vicious circle but in "arsenal" believe the improvement of injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, back in order after injury, you are vulnerable - during this time you need to rebuild forces and gain a competitive advantage," said Hungary.
Jack is young enough and will cope.
I hope he will recover physically, I'm sure of it, as well as that his career will be the kind he deserves.
Arsenal start a campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday mating with "Dynamic Zagreb" and will continue her Saturday games with Chelsea and next Wednesday - with Tottenham Hotspur and Hungary intend to roll out the squad.
Eleanor Bellevue and Aaron Roemzi did not come to Croatia, therefore most likely in the starting line-up will be played by Mathieu Debyukov and Arteta.
Perhaps Hungary will also introduce the composition of Kirana Gibbs and Olivier Zira instead Start Moreale and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little respite to the players that need it," said the Hungarian.
Though Arsenal are the undisputed favourites in Group F, the Stadium "Maximir" in Zagreb is among the most deferential in Europe.
Dynamo has not lost to any of the 41 matches since they managed to have past season as "unstoppable."
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake by force of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
The Hungarian is confident Arsenal have learned a lesson from last season when the team defeated the Champions League game from Monaco and remains with a weak hope to lead the club to victory in the Champions League final.
"It's an incredible drive," Hungary observed.
Arsenal never did.
We were very close to the goal in 2006 but, on the other hand, I'm a realist with an internship.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A comedy show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The lack of such stories is thrown into the eye, especially considering how desperate the men's demand for frankness is, now more than ever, with the rate of suicide among young men being at their maximum in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the only biggest cause of death by men aged between 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom, and with men going three times more often than with women.
In an attempt to tackle the issue of Campaign Against Non-Private Life declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that does not give men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to take this call.
A recent study by more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression has revealed that if a patient has a fairly large number of friends "in a normal mood," the odds of a cure are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends halve the chance for mental disorders.
But of course that friendship worked, first and foremost, that she was.
In an era where communication is managed by social networks, when the style prefers content, the speed of the answer is often appreciated more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to appear strong, loving fun and successful, even if the reality is loneliness.
Such a superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our internal aspiration for personal growth and friendship, that stronger influences our mental health.
And, as one billionaire, the creator of video games recently observed, didn't buy any more happiness.
The dignity of the Friends is that they are attracted to that attention.
Each of the characters was determined not through his work, but rather through the personality that showed up in conversation with friends.
The humour of Joui and the constant embrace of Chariot, moments of watching football on the comfortable chairs, Rossa's breathlessness on Rachel - all comes from an understanding that men can feel it, even if they often abstain from a full study of their feelings.
As the Samaritans employee said:..." my role of listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal mood highlights how even the smallest communication of friends can benefit."
Often the men who appeal to us feel unable to speak to friends.
The old learning is "live with it," as well as feeling that frank conversation about problems can be perceived as weakness."
The Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-running coping mechanisms.
It emphasized the little-noticed moments of the men's friendship.
As for my task, the status of an outside person talking on the phone helps people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from the close circle of family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, where for the holiday completely restored scenery, why not take your friends drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better - if you see a single person in Starbucks, smile and say "Hello."
You don't guess what kind of a friendship might bring in advance.
The series "Friends" show on Comedy Central beginning and end, all 236 series, by tag # FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal, helping PSG defeat Malm√∂
Anhelel di Maria along with Blaise Mathydi and Edinburgh Cavani celebrate scored goals in the gates of Malm√∂.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal than allowed the PSG easily to bypass Malm√∂ on Tuesday.
Here's the report of the match and the reaction to the game.
Chantelle di Maria and Edinburgh Cavani did their thing when "Pari Saint-Germain" started their game in the Champions League with an extremely comfortable win of 2: 0 against Malm√∂ at Park De Prens Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after starting his first game in the Champions League as a PSG player to question the direction of France's champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increased their advantage when the Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Alongside Real Madrid and Doncaster Shahter in Group A, "Pari" needed to take a good start in the game against champions Sweden, as they aimed not to qualify for the playoffs, but for the continuation of a series of successful games of the last three seasons where they have reached out to the quarter-finals.
They earned points but at the same time was not the best tackle by Lauran Blake to count Zlatan Ibrahimovic's useless in the attack and would later replace him on the pitch in a game against a team from his hometown and club, in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy - to win at home or in the Champions League, so to win with the score of 2: 0, to deliver the rivals of problems and to play well in defending - it's a good start, even if there are still some points that we will need to finalize during the season," Blake said.
That's promising.
We wanted to win and we made it, although I'm sorry we didn't score for one or two balls more.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the substitutions as part of the Paris team, which brought her a draw with a score of 2: 2 in a match against Bordeaux in the first league this weekend but was pushed back to Di Maria's backfield goal in the fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker pointed out as a player able to bring a "PSJ" to a new level in Europe after his last month bought either Manchester United, and he proved why when he ran out for a pass from Marco Verratti behind defending Malm√∂ and nicely completed the attack, sending the ball past Johnathan Thurston to the far corner of the gate.
However, if one was expecting an easy and big victory, they had to disappoint them.
Malm√∂, who defeated the Selfies in the playoffs to reach this stage by having a combined nine-wicket world level on the pitch early in the game, five defenders and two touchdown midfielders in midfield, were a serious opponent.
But, except for the hit, Nikola Djurjic, in which the ball flew past the front side of Kevin Trappe's gate on the 34-point minute, they were attacking quite a bit.
But the PSJ have at times pinned themselves with less than five attempts and a weak attack, especially from Ibrahimovic, who in the first half failed to implement at least five tries and then failed to handle the ball scored by the Cavani immediately after the game's resume.
However, he showed himself a lot more skilfully in a precise graze and it was a passing from Ibrahimovic, getting which, Di Maria sent a ball of season-ending kick that passed the innings to the bar past Wilanda in the 52 minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour mark thanks to the Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball of the season after an Ibrahimovic sub-footed ball sent to the centre of the field from the left flank by Maxwell.
That put an end to any ideas that Malm√∂ had about returning to the game, and only intercepting the ball of Wilde from close range didn't allow David to increase the final score before the substitute Esekel Lavessie didn't score a goal in the concussion of the match.
Malm√∂ coach Rod Hared later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian telling: "Our last game in the Champions League was held last December."
Since then we've only played in the Swedish league, and that's not the level.
Qualifying is not enough.
Glory "Pari"!
It was a wonderful match with them.

White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official message that China's head of state Xi Jinping will arrive with an official visit to the US later this month.

President and US first lady Michelle Obama will also accept Xi Jinping with wife Pat LYuan at a government dinner tonight after the two leaders will hold bilateral talks.

On the occasion of the upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of the cooperation the honorary Consul of the Republic of Belarus will be presented in Tyumen, Vladimir Shcoal, who was included into the official delegation.
Vladimir Fyodorovich, what are the objectives set by the Sochi Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on fruitful cooperation between the regions - important links between the relations between the two countries.
It is planned that the plenary meeting will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
In the frames of plenary and sectional sessions we will talk about the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, the regulatory and programs of the Union State.
The governor of the Tyumen region will be on the forum.
I think this is evidence of successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and agencies, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also be attending the forum.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will be served, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to broker new profitable contracts and agreements.
I added that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
More than two hundred delegates participated in his work, including from 19 regions of Russia.
A very important agreement on cooperation between Tyumen and Minsk regions was signed.
About the importance of our developments is the fact that in Tyumen there was a session of the permanent seminar at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
In addition, the Delegation of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus in the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of the Belarusians in the training of agriculture, identification of additional points of contact and organization of new investment projects in the field of agro-industrial complex.
You have recently met with the region's head and head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the governor of Tyumen region, Vladimir Yakuzev talked about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in modern difficult conditions.
The question of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms - they are needed - is needed to reduce the cost of cars for the end user.
The problems were discussed in the work of Belshina supermarket trading house and options for preventing losses.
Matters are important, because investment projects should clearly work and bring profit to the region.
It was said about further deliveries of the "MAZ" passenger trucks, the development of "MAZ" service center, which was created in Tyumen on the base of OJSC "TPATP."
The conversation also touched upon the preparation of travel of the region's working delegation to the Republic of Belarus until the end of the current year.
Another topic of discussion was the completion of the agreement and signing of the agreement on the trade and economic, scientific and technical and cultural cooperation of the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
So the dynamics of the relationship promise to go to a new level.
These issues were related to the regional center.
During the meeting with the head of the city of Tyumen, Alexander Moor we talked about updating of the Tyumen Bus Park.
About 100 buses are already "breathing on the lads," because a new batch of cars from Belarus will be needed, which will work in gas, ecologically clean fuel.
One more aspect: Tyumen lift plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of lift products JSC "Mogilevskymash," receiving accessories.
In my opinion, this activity could be more active, considering the programs to install new elevators at the regional center.
I would like to add that in the framework of extended powers of the consul there was a meeting with the governor of Kurgan region Alexey Kokorin, during which the question of increase of turnover and supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zauralye was discussed.
A meeting with the town governor was scheduled for the end of September.
The consular district consists of five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a district headquarters.
The region is a polygon for the shelling of many perspective projects, including work of the honorable general consul.
In general, such meetings are significant and good to be addressed directly and quickly to solve many problems by removing their sharp and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
Under current conditions it is extremely important not to destroy the ass, continuing to work for perspective.
Matt Damon against putting emphasis on ethnic diversity of people involved in film production
Matt Damon ventured with producer African-American Effect Brown, saying behind the scenes that consider the ethnic composition not necessary.
During the Sunday issue of the Project Greenlight on the HBO channel, the acclaimed actor interrupted Brown when she tried to highlight the need for alternative views of the mainstream black heroine in the chosen scenario.
"Diversity is appropriate when you spend casting for the movie itself, not for the show," insisted Dave.
Ocharashal Brown, not believing his ears, resented "Ogo, nothing to her own," all the time while the actor from Marsyanin gave the comments in a live video.
To discuss the finals of the show for Damon and Brown are joined by singer Ben Afflek and the Farelli brothers.
"I would like the participants - no matter who will be the director - to think of what image interpretation and they are going to stick to," Brown said at the start of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white sutener.
The film's producer, Dear White People, campaigned for film directors Leo Angelo and Kristen Branlcio; Dave was sharply opposed, saying that "as a result we can get none of what we want."
After this discussion was shown live on television, social networks blew up disapproval comments to Dave's address.
The Twitter user Mrs. Pooni was angry about the show in the video: "It is an explanation of the essence of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room Nay, white, that is painful."
It has sold more than 5,000 retesses and 4000 "liners."
Damon's remarks appear just when competent coverage in the media is the most acute issue on the agenda.
After 2014, a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by police, Black Lives Matter movement has overturned popularity across the country, calling on lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminating practices against colored populations.
In February, the Grammy Awards mentioned the movement during presentation of the "Album of the Year" award at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"The albums still matter," he said.
Like the books and the lives of blacks, albums still matter.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have released an official statement in response to the question of Fox News contributor Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group was seen as a group of haters.
"The network of Black Lives Matter is a love group," the movement's leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in a list of showbiz figures, producers and media tycoons invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and met the Pope.
'American Ninja Warrior' awards first champion
A professional scalolaz and assistant waiter Ayzek Kaldiero on Monday night was the first winner of the show's "American Ninja Warrior," taking home a $1 million prize.
On this sport show, the 7th season of which has just finished, none of the participants managed to pass all stages of the track with obstacles.
In the final season, the two participants - Kaldiero and cameraman Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a climb of a rope length of 75 feet in 30 seconds.
Britten performed the task first and performed at the set time, becoming the first athlete in the entire history of "American Ninja Warrior," past exhausting stage 4, but Kaldiero handled the task for the whole three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
After the win, delivered with an incredibly hard work, Kaldiero, who was in shock from having won a million dollars, gave an interview to "E! News."
"To think about it is unbelievable, I have never been earning or living more than $10,000 a year," commented Aizek to journalists E! Such a serious leap of their income.
And suddenly it is... I never even imagined it as it is... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent UID met with journalists "The Hollywood Reporter" to talk about the final and about why Britten, who first passed the track, will not receive any money prize.

"Kidnapping" and "Kidnapping"
Minneapolis - The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams once, "Tygers" is now ranked last in the American League's central division.
Pretending to be a hindrance, "Thanksgiving" was won on Tuesday by "Minnesota Trudy" with the result of 5-4 on "Targeted."
The Tigers missed a chance to cut back on halftime from the Houston Astros and ranked second in the playoffs by the number of points after the winners.
For the children, even for one night, it was a return of the word on F, which eluded them most of the second half of the season.
"All the winnings are fun, it doesn't matter how they get done," the manager Brad Osmus said.
"timeout" pitcher Alfredo Simon made a contribution to supporting the attacks, resulting in Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then added another one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was pitching at 6 1/3 innings and missed three carries.
It was only his third quality start for nine exits.
"I just want to finish the year with good performance," Simon said.
Pitches on a replacement can't throw in every game and so I want to go deeper into the game.
Victor Mart√≠nez has beaten three hits and his first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits since four blows in a game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked bitterly," Osmus said.
He showed up well in (as a biker), visibly better at the run of bat and kept it quality for the game.
By typing three runs in the second half of the seventh inning, Tilton got his best chance of returning to the game.
Central host Bayron Bakston opened an inning off the touchdown on the left line of the field.
Raytfielder Aaron Hicks, who made a biting, took the first base and a second runner, Brian Doziere, received an ostentatious impact on the whip from Simon before his place took the left-back Blake Hardy.
Hardy bypassed Moyer, the only player on the way, earlier a new appointed beating Miguel Sano, who knocked out a two-run "single" to the left by right-hander Drew Upper.
With a pair of runners not in the match and comparing the second base of VerHagen managed to bring third baseball Trevor Pluck to the beating in the daff-play.

However, the right player scored Sano after three wickets and received his fifth deposit.
Detroit took advantage of a temporarily untrained Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The "timers" earned three catches in the first two innings against the deserved pitcher, who was listed injured before the game, missing more than a month due to an inflammation of the expletives.
"Absolutely not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed I became feeling more comfortable and so was able to perform some pretty good throws in the third inning."
After the first biker reached out to the first base, Hughes dropped a single second touchdown of Iain Kinsler.
Uok, who made a single midfielder for the first shot of the game.
Viktor Martelly finished his series "0 for 21" with early results.
The third-base player, Nick Castelloosa, then made a "single," resulting in another wound, but Victor Martelly was beaten in an attempt to get closer to the third base, and the threat was eliminated.
"Thanksgiving" increased the score in second inning, having received one-to-one "dabl" from James McCann's James McCann and the two-on-one "single" of the central beating Anthony Goose, and slipped 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," Tigers manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't particularly well beat, but he got straight at the right point.
Hughes, who had been inducted, threw himself into the third inning, after which he was replaced by a teammate A. J. Ahter.
Hughes counted three of six hits and a touchdown with four assists.
Notes: Pitcher's great-uncle Anibal Sanchez was out of the players due to the stretch of the right shoulder.
He will be treated by Dr James Andrews, who was doing Sanchez shoulder surgery as early as 2007.

The original complaint by Kadyrov on the book "pleading for God" was entered in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.
In Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the secret of an appeal complaint by the representative of Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov on the decision to recognize "the extremist material" of the book "plead to God: Its meaning and place in Islam," reported Interfax, with a reference to the Chairman of the Court of Justice Alexander Chuhayak.
The court is now awaiting possible objections to the participants of the process.
Chukhhaven refused to comment on the claims by some of the Russian Duma deputies about the need to test the case for possible cooperation with foreign special services and ISIS.
"Let ourselves comment on such stupidity," he said.
On September 11, the city's Attorney General filed an appeal on the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko on the recognition of the book "extremist material."
The district attorney's office issued an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: The prosecutor's office believes they have asked the court to acknowledge the extremist only view of the author of this book, not the Ayatollah of the Koran.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision," Chukhhaven reported.
The decision to recognise the book "extremist material" was taken on August 12, 2015.
In particular, "extremist" were named quotes from the Koran - "You are worshipping and You pray for help."
Kadyrov called the decision on the book by "bandmates and provocateurs."
He called for legislation to ban judicial decisions relating to the texts of the scriptures.
"I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should adopt a law in accordance with which it is forbidden to take on a court decision relating directly to the texts of the Quran and other Divine Scriptures," Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will delete comments insulting migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to delete posts and comments in which a negative assessment of migrants and refugees is given.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
To combat the manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, the leadership of "Feisbechka" intends jointly with the German Ministry of Justice.
Thus, on the eve of the head of the department, Hyko Mayas stated that at present the minisk together with the specialists of the social network is engaged in creation of a special group of moderators.
Its participants are required to monitor and remove flawed attitudes towards migrants and refugees.
According to Hayko Mayasa, it is assumed that the authors of the inaccurate posts will receive notices indicating the reason for removing their record.
The organizations whose specialists are engaged in the collection of complaints from the social network of complaints about offensive posts should be facilitated by the operative blocking of illegal content.
The leadership of Fifa intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements in the address of migrants and refugees, the social network's leadership and the German justice ministry were taken after the "Feisbeak" in the German segment sharply increased xenophobic sentiment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them has become unprecedented on the scale of the migration crisis engulfing the EU countries some time ago.
So, Germany is already overwhelmed by all the points allocated to accommodate the refugees.
On the eve of the power of the country decided to temporarily settlement the migrants in the territory of the former concentration camp Buchenwald.
Refugees from the Middle East and Africa are stationed in the barracks, where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under Nazi regime.
Moscow cemeteries will have zones for relaxation.
In the nearest future several underground cemeteries are equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be the Butovskoye, Domodedovo, and Shcherbinsk cemetery.
The first zone for psychological rest has already appeared at the Trinity Cemetery in Moscow.
Similar areas will appear in other areas of the city.
On this portal m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, who occupies the position of Head of the State budget institution "Ritual."
The relaxation zones will present small landscaping areas resembling parks.
According to specialists in such "places" visitors to cemeteries will be able to rest, to be alone with themselves and to restore psychological forces.
Soon zones for relaxation will be constructed in Domodedovo, Butovsky and Shcherbinsk cemeteries and then in other districts of the capital.
According to the head of GBU "Ritual," if there is a need to expand the area of the cemetery, builders will try to keep existing forest arrays as possible.
Green plants will serve as a living fence which will share the areas of rest and area reserved for burial places.
Experts of GBU "Ritual" have also declared their intention to make a proposal of refusal from the city to the burial places.
New cemeteries may indeed become irreconcilable.
In addition, in GBU "Ritual" have told about readiness to be engaged in installation of electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors of cemeteries can learn the GPS coordinates and number marks of burial places.
In June this year "Ritual" has also offered to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of the year.
Thus, the lynching of the graves in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the ground is frozen.
It should be noted that during the last year the rates for all types of ritual services have risen by an average of 10%.
In the elenian forests five days later found the lost fungus.
An elderly man appeared to be alive, though he had spent more than a hundred hours in a forest less than a hundred hours.
It was discovered by the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest.
Without food and water.
He was searched by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even kinicians with dogs, but the result was not.
The man discovered the man after a helicopter was connected to a search engine.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the forest behind the hills and villages, but by the evening he did not return.
Relatives immediately appealed for help, and the next day the search for the fungus was raised by rescuers and indifferent residents from the neighbouring village - only about 30 people.
The firefighters rescue centre was joined on the Friday afternoon.
Andrew Seletkov, head of the search and rescue group of the fire rescue group of the Smolensk region, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was discovered."
Gone very far, completely elsewhere.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He went a huge distance at his age.
Miraculously remained alive.
He was taken to the Elementary Central District Hospital without consciousness, in extremely serious condition.
Medics diagnosed pneumonia as well as severe dehydration and re-cooling of the body.
As an older man has been able to stay alive after five spent in the woods of the day, the doctors absolutely do not represent.
Valentina Neptune, head of the family's therapeutic department: "The treatment is prescribed for the patient, the treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Taking into account all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition in the morning has improved, but with positive dynamics.
The pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich arrives on Smolensk from the Tambov region every year.
His grandson says that grandfather and before went to collect mushrooms, but far into the forest has never been deepened.
Alexei Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, it is basically not local."
For several years, guests were invited to visit their relatives.
Well, and went for mushrooms.
Probably, I went far away and got lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all parts of the Smolensk region.
Just over the last few days five similar cases.
Rescuers remind you that in the forest you need to go in bright clothes, with a small store of food, spoilers and a compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave tracks for you to go back.
An emergency An-2 sat down on the lookout in the brotherly taiga.
Right on the drill in Siberia emergency An-2.

The ship was denied engines and on-board electronics, but the crew did their impossible.
On board the plane there were 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one at the airport's emergency unit was hurt.
The Economics of the Nobel laureate: Globalization
Printing the processes of globalization should contribute to reducing inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the income gap in developing economies is, on the contrary, rising.
Eric Maskin.
In order to remedy this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced an enormous increase in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization have predicted big gains for emerging economies.
"And these are the forecasts in a lot of things," Maskin said.
For example, China and India have received serious per capita GDP growth.
However, not all are so rosy.
It was expected that globalization would reduce the gap between the "have-nots" and "have-nots" in poor countries, which manifest themselves in greater income inequality, and more precisely than pay for labor.
But this disparity has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, which translated and cited NIE.
In conjunction with an economist, Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income gaps in poor countries are rising, like the MA.
There are specific processes on the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Maskin alters four skills of specialists - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, experts from poor countries lack the level of qualification to cooperate with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And, if lower-income workers from poor countries are growing up due to cooperation with the employees of the B from the rich, they do not feel either their wages down at all.
The final effect is that the internationalization of production will increase the wage gap between the two categories of specialists in poor countries and accordingly to increase the level of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin offer a surprisingly beautiful model, alternative to the rikardian theory of comparative advantage.
It allows to explain why globalization has led to income inequality," said Fuad Alesorov, an ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Choice of Solutions, the head of the Institute of Mathematics, NIU VSHE.
And as any powerful theory is, I am sure that it will lead to an outbreak of empirical work in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, employees like the scientist do not have funds, and companies are not profitable to pay for their training.
Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, Maskin believes.
The scientist points out that the developed theory does not, in any case, call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has brought and yields fruit in the form of GDP growth.
Derbent: Live connection of times.
Derbent - one of the most ancient cities of Russia - in September marks its 2000-anniversary.
In the program of celebratory events - the festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and the fair in the style of past times, the exhibition of derbentar carpets and the Day of open temples, the historical-musical show "2000 years for two hours" and excursions into the reconstructed Museum of Peter I.
The medieval stones of Naryn-Kala fortress, ancient Arabian inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens, all seemed to be from the pages of "Thousand and One Nights."
Derbent is the only Russian city that has preserved its place since ancient times.
Although the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Khazar Haganat and the Golden Horde were used to it.
The age of the Eastern platans, which grow in the yard of the derbentian JUMA-METHETI, equals several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Village - monuments of living nature."
The shadow of the rafting will save pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The visitors of the mosque will have an abundance of aromatic tea and carnivals of the Dagestani delicacy - copper figs, permafrost, mushmuth, leopstone wonderment, ayoon and sweetness.
In Derbente, centuries are used by large males, in order for one time to drink tea of many guests.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma-mosque says the building is built in the 115 year of the hijra.
That is in 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
It is the most ancient mosque in Russia.
The interior is spectacular and solemn: The arcades of the domes and the vaults are based on square columns and illuminated by the sun rays from tiny windows.
The contents and breeding of pigeons is a traditional hobby of the inhabitants of Derbanta.
Pet owners place the pigeons in the yards, under the trees, on the hatches.
An exciting sight is a takeaway into the sky stacks of white doves similar to the flash of the festive fireworks display.
For the defence against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian gates with a double stone wall.
Having gone 500 meters into the sea, this building was locked in the harbour of Derbanta.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbanta were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most well-preserved monument of the ancient Persian fortification architecture.
The carpets in Derbente flowed back to the 5th century, and up to today the technology of this unique craft remained almost unchanged.
On one of the adjacent streets of the city street, carpets are sold on any taste - sticks of wool, cotton or felt of all colours and shades, with tequila and no one, with complex ornamentation and quirky kitty.
The building of the town began with the maggots - the quarters with one-storey stone constructions.
The Magpies have almost changed for years.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioning on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in medieval but in the modern city.
In the old part of town there are the details of a water pipe, built by the Persians about a thousand years ago.
Our days have passed ancient sources, in which local people and now gather water.
Many derbentans prefer regular water from the cranes of the tested historical fountains.
One of the motor craft's centres was located in Derbente.
Polished and painted vases, dishes, pots and cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of the goncharov and now produce wonderful ceramic goods both practical and souvenir.
In the days of celebrations and festivals, spectators gather under the strained canon, on which the students of the Republican school of circus art show.
The history of remarkable and risky craftsmanship counts several centuries.
The new trend - among the roosters' walkers are increasingly seen as girls.
The Museum "Culture and Life of Ancient Derbendent" is being held in the building of the former virgin bath today.
Earlier here there were unmarried girls and the bride accompanied by a girlfriend, and now anyone can see a step-dome room, hot and cold swimming pools that have gone past bath accessories.
In most of the houses there is a hot water, but the saunas and the parks are popular in the same way.
The steam is written in ancient books about the benefits of heating of the body.
After the bath improves blood, muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility and ease.
In the festival "The Commonwealth," which takes place in the territory of Naryn-Kala fortress, is taking part by the ethnocasings of many districts of Dagestan.
The participants in the national costumes dance, play folk melodies and play songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors to tasty homemade cheese.
Karachhlyr is a burial place of forty martyrs who have changed their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most respected complexes for Muslims of the Northern Caucasus.
On the other hand, the sarcophagus are carved out of solid stone blocks and are oriented as to the Arabs, according to the axis of west east.
The Gavril brothers and Albert Yakubovs shake up and break customers in a small cabin near the Upper Bazaar.
The Barber has been in the area for many years.
The techniques of circus craft are passed from generation to generation.
Moreover, the Yakubovs brothers can do not only traditional but also the most modern hairstyles.
On one of the streets of the Old City the house was kept, in which lived referred to the Caucasus literature writer Alexander Bestuzov-Marlinsky.
Having studied Turkic language and collected ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third of XIX century with its ancient monuments, life and bull citizens.
Teakhouse is a traditional club of East where only tea and homemade pastries are served.
Men come here to quell your thirst, talk to friends and solve some problems.
As in previous times, women are not recommended to step in the tea area.
Derbentsky dance ensemble "Caspian" was established three years ago, but has already taken part in the events of republican and Russian level.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse each day, learning in perfect folk avarian, Dargin, Tatar, Armenian dances.
With the early evening, when the noise and incense of street lights are lit up, locals are racking up on an avalanche near houses with floor terraces.
As a rule, the derbentans discuss household issues.
But, on the eve of the anniversary they are increasingly recalling episodes of the unique history of their city, influenced by the fate of the entire Black and Caspian region.
The business "game of the airport" took place in Domodedovo.
There is a new form of training in the capital.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport staff.
For this purpose the models of three airplanes were mounted in Domodedovo.
The young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also served planes.
All this is in the form of a business game, however, it has not yielded to reality.
Late arrivals, immediately two passengers with fractures on board, the hunt lost somewhere along the road to the aircraft.
For the real airport is hell.
For those who have settled in the hangar of Domodedovo is a standard set of jobs that are to be solved by newcomers.
In one hangar there were three major airports from different countries of the world.
Today, there are four hundred students from university colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn everything about the domestic world of aviagavani.
Registration of passengers, service of airplanes, baggage turnover - they trust even the buses on the flight field, boards and screening of passengers.
And the passengers are solid problem.
One inordinate with the documents, another was late for a flight, a third filled bag of suspicious items.
And deal with all this is necessary, as in life - in the minimum term.
For each of these tasks they receive a certain amount, virtual cash, as if they have paid the corresponding amount for flight maintenance.
"For failing to comply with their respective tasks, the penalty is charged," Financial analyst Dmitry Khilko said in an interview.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are following scrutiny.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try new forms of learning.
She has already found a place in the field of secondary vocational education.
"The six interregional centers of competence will be formed, which will be essentially new models of activity of modern colleges with modern management system, with highly skilled personnel, with modern equipment," said Natalia Zolotareva, Director of the Department of Public Policy in the field of training of workers and additional professional education.
But students are not up to global plans.
After three days of such a workout, they seem to need a day off.
However, the evaluation for this exam had quite a material expression.
The latest smartglasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for a timely reply to our airport on Instagram," says the participant of the game, PR manager of the hotel "Airport Frankfurt" Sergey Shuvalov.
The best judges, called, took to the pencil to be invited to work at the time of the study.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret in connection with the closure of a foreign literature library of the American center.
The centre has been working in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the US embassy of the United States at the All-Russia State Library named after M.I.Rudomino in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation have recently challenged the government's commitment to Russia's relations between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the Cold War and in other difficult moments of the long history of our countries" relations," said U.S. Ambassador John Tefft, who arrived at Interfax.
The American Center created deep and strong connections between people and culture of Russia and the United States.
He represented the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and served as a venue for meetings with numerous American prominent figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, academics, politicians and writers.
"Only last year the American center spent more than 400 cultural and educational events and took over 50,000 Russian visitors," the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX Educational Exchange (the Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal appeared to be quick at the crucifixion.
Typical situation: Four officials stand in front of the desk judge Svatantaire Kumar, listening to his claims for the job.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order, so that you'll get over it," says Kumar.
If there is another brick, we will show all the existing buildings.
Kumar leads the National Green Tribunal (NZT) - a judicial authority set up in 2010 to stem the rapid environmental pollution accompanying the tumultuous economic growth of recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal had examined more than 10 thousand claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological exploration, toxic waste and building dams.
In two of the three cases, the court decides whether to stop the building leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: For the incomplete 60 years since the announcement of the independence of intensified industrial development, India has become the country of the virgin jungle in one of the most crowded and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large mega cities, where infrastructure development does not lead to rapid urbanization: Cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste of enterprises and households, and few remaining dwellings are cut under construction of new residential quarters.
Despite the formal support for the green movement on the part of the state, the NPR is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the abolition of major investment projects.
So, in May this year, the environment minister called the court's decisions "extreme" and "impossible."
Sometimes a court decision really cannot be executed in the given court date, confirms the lawyer for environmental affairs Radha Pandjwani.
However, unfulfilled grandparents have a positive side: At least they are forcing the responsible people to move.
"His main goal is to shake up this system," the lawyer added.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly cancelled the major construction projects: On its account the termination of the construction of the airport, power station and hundreds of smaller structures.
In this case, people try not to forget, for example, when discussing the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagnan State, polluted by the local fluoride river.
We can close your factory, but we are responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose jobs," commented Kumar's decision.
But such explanations do not always find understanding among ordinary people whose lives can change thanks to a single scrap of referee pen.
Thus, in April the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital than caused by public outrage.
Despite the soaring popularity and shredding of criticism, Svatanter Kumar has refused to repeal the decision.
Instead, he ordered a Delhi government to statistics on entering and travel vehicles, and also made a proposal to purchase 10,000 extra buses, having previously learned in the factories, whether they were able to perform a similar order.
As the court's attention began to catch up with such sources of pollution, such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents, popular anger has begun to sharpen.
But the most sick topic of the principal judge was the clean-up programme of the Ganges, with the pompous announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganga - sacred to the Indians of the river, the judge often stops restraining his emotions and passes on the cry.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from Ganga on the statue of God, and in it were feces.
You continue to contaminate the river because you think: The Ganges are the Ganges, it will take all our sins.
It's the river we worship and see what you do with it every day.
Ganga's clearance is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the amount of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm more than 120 times.
Between 1.5 and 3 of the 700 million merchants in it, Hindus die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Ganga rescue fund, bailed out of the sale of his suit, in which he met Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: The suit was bought for $700,000, while clearing the river requires at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India will have a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but does not believe that the price of progress should be ecology.
"In a developing country, the talk about the environment is often perceived as an unbreakable luxury," said the activist of the organization "Zov Ganga" Malik Bkhanot.
And the court tries to find a golden middle between ecology and development."
A man poured blood on a few paintings of Dali at an exhibition in Riga.

Xi Jinping calls to make economy more open to peace
The economy should become more open to the whole world to spur its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in an address to the group ahead of the challenge to the reform guide.
"China should concentrate on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing a policy of openness," he said, addressing the participants of the 16th meeting of the Central Front Committee for comprehensive deepening of reforms.
He said that increasing openness and deepening reforms would give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The leading group has adopted a number of directives, including introducing the regulation of investor access to the market, changing border controls, the encouragement of state-owned enterprises (SOE), attracting private capital and revising the registration system for residents.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of economy and production, inaccessible to investment, will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually worked out through trial programs.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a more significant role in the allocation of resources, ensuring legitimacy in business and increased openness, as the statement said.
The government will also weaken control of the powers given to them by firms, ensuring that companies themselves will run their business.
The statement also said that China would allow border regions to master new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to boost local growth.
More areas will be made available to private investors in order to improve the openness of the state-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign financing, and provide them with better conditions," the statement said.
In addition there will be a simplified procedure for applying for permanent residence permit, or "grin-card," by optimizing requirements and simplifying the process of the application process.
The meeting also discussed the protection of lawyers' rights and questions of training of professional judges and prosecutor's office.
According to the official report released after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
