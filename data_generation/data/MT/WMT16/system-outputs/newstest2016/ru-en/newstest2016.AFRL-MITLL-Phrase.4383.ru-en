By the end of the day the victims will be one more: Lamb committed suicide as soon as police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting in the educational establishment has forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, officials still were trying to fold in one picture of the motives which Lamba.
The information, which shared the investigators in both ends of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, helped draw up a portrait of a talented, but perhaps anxious teacher.
The students said that they waited impatiently for his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where perished Prentiss, reported that it is not accusations of violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Eissa Lamba in the book, in which he expressed his gratitude to the "beautiful people" with whom he had business in his teaching life.

Earlier, Lamb asked Delta State University to provide sick leave, saying that he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two.
Recent changes in university employment rules meant that the degree of doctor worked on getting so insistently Lamb would not guaranteed him an automatic teacher positions.
University President William La Forge said that nothing is known about the conflict between him and Schmidt, but "obviously Mr. Lamba was something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer answer.
The police attacked mark Lamba after his escape from the campus when he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could arrest, Lamb shot from 38 caliber pistol in the back yard at home, one mile south of his parents' home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, reported Washington County coroner Broom Johnson.
His car with the engine running was still on the approach road.
It was unclear why Lamb came to this house, though, according to Johnson, she believes that he knew people who lived in it.
Lamb grew up in those regions.
Lamb started working at the University, which is 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009, and taught geography and pedagogy in order.
He received the degree of doctor of Pedagogical Sciences in the spring of that year.
One of the longtime friends Lamba described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny man.
Carla said she was 15 and 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a good guy older, who for several years has been trying to teach her to play the guitar.
In those years he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls melt at when he was there, "says, which is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, Heath suburbia.
Lamb and Prentiss at the time of the events, probably, have met for some time.
During a call in 911 Lamb said: "I killed my wife," but there is no record of the registration of their marriage.
The pair have had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house in Gautier, the flip side of which goes on the channel.
According to police, the dog is OK.
Ex-husband Prentiss, Sean O 'Steen, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but have remained friends, and that they have a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She is very devastated," Steen told 'about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
About 'Steen said that he had not met but had heard from his daughter Abigail, that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both played on the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together at concerts from time to time.
About 'Steen said that his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and part-time coordinator of entertainment programs in a dimly lit bar Room in the suburb of Gautier, said the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica and for the few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and above each other.
In the sense that they were both very boutonniere.
Schmidt, the lost teacher, conducted seminars for freshmen and majored in the history of the Native Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher in the same educational establishment.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Kansas State University in Emporia early and was the president of the student Fraternity and self-government.
Delta State University Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university professors, staff, students and community members attended a memorial ceremony, lighting candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the University choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We try to bring our students," La Forge said.
The crisis passed.
Today is a day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped cook the Associated Press writers Emily P. in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a police statement that Lamba entered the service call 911 after the assassination of Schmidt, and also due to the fact that although Lamb and spoke about Prentiss as his wife when the call was made to 911, information that they were married, not confirmed.

8 Survey results that show that Donald Trump is not joking
Some have tried to impose the label attached to him.
Other officials dismissed him as having accepted the joke.
Some require a scandal.
But as some Republicans try to shake the high position of Donald Trump in the results of polls they failed (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trump in double figures, and some are beginning to seriously ask, what does this mean for the real estate tycoon from the point of view of the chances to get a nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that the Republican Party has a chance to Trump the nominees.
Experts indicate that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry lost his credits the popularity of sustainable Hermann, none of whom has won and one state in the nominating process.
And there are many reasons why he would want to fight the general election.
But outside groups such as "worried," Jeb Bush's political and economic conservative group Club for Growth "acknowledge an unrelenting force Trump and begin to get their dollars to overthrow it.
Here are some of the poll figures that suggest that the real estate magnate - not just an intermediate phase:
The ratings of liking for Trump turned around 180 degrees.
Directly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in the middle of June, a poll at the University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans positively disposed to this real estate magnate.
It was 40 percent by the middle of July.
It was 52 percent in early August.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive attitude to Donald.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators they prevail at the initial stages.
A poll in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of Republicans there are.
Two thirds of those who voted for the GOP would suit Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN / ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "good" or "pleased" if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "disappointed" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say that they would be treated "with delight" against 40 percent of those who say the same thing about).
The next level of delight?
Marco Rubio, who is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they are "not satisfied" or "upset" if Jeb Bush will become the favorite of the establishment candidate.
Most Republicans do not view the Trump temperament problem.
While Trump massively criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 percent of left-leaning academics Republican voters across the country think that tycoon suitable temperament to be president, as a poll showed ABC News / Washington Post poll on Monday.
The same figure appears on the ground in the country closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he is the man who could be the top commander, according to last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think he is not a man who can be effective in the post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Get used to this thought.
When they wear their hats connoisseurs think that Trump is seriously.
On the question of who is the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was the favorite, according to the CNN / ORC poll last week.
It is no longer so when four out of 10 have set on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP Voters have not previously been properly magical.
At the same time, in the last cycle the cycle of four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the frontrunner, while only 28 percent supported the eventual candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it shows that many GOP voters consider Trump persuasive campaign.
Even if Republicans have rallied around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some pundits suggest that this variation is likely to Trump plays the advantage, and simultaneously not supporting Trump evenly distributed among supporting more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll conducted by the University in early September shows that in a hypothetical competition "one on one" between Trump and most other republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
Carly Fiorina -- he is ahead by 13 points, Marco Rubio on 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and, finally, Rand Paul, John and Chris Christie on 33 points.
He had a tie with Ted Cruise.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson is a businessman on the whole 19 points in a hypothetical competition "one on one".
Slightly more than half of Donald Trump supporters say they want.
The new CBS / NYT poll, conducted Tuesday, shows that just over half of voters supporting Trump, say they are confident in their voices.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change the situation, and no one can really say that he never changes his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
So n, the most tense competition Trump have at the moment - with Neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they want is likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since two months ago, Donald Trump has called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his speech of the whole campaign, immigration has become the most urgent topic in conversations in 2016.
Some worry that posturing Trump turn key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.
But according to the ABC / Post poll conducted Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump in matters of immigration.
Therefore, until immigration attracts attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Frustration with the government is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson is now counting on support from about half, mainly because of his outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans Monday in a new ABC / Post poll say they want a political outsider, rather than a person with experience in government.
And they also took offence to Washington.
The Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa disappointed the activities of Republicans in Congress, while 54 percent "ensure" and 21 percent "in fury."
The government decides the fate of indexations pensions in October.

About the same worth indexation of pensions in full next year.

Jeremy Corbin debuts in a session of questions to the Prime Minister
After the election of Mr. Corbina his debut on a session of questions the Prime Minister is expected with great impatience
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin soon, for the first time at a session of questions to the Prime Minister, the first time the forces with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will perform the first of six allocated questions in the afternoon; his performance is likely to be closely follow the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He made an appeal for "less theater and more facts" on a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said that it may miss some meetings, leaving their colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbina as a leader; it will happen after the appointment of their shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Congress of Trade unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silently during a performance of the national anthem at the service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from some conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several advanced articles in newspapers.
The decision not to sing the national anthem attracted the attention of Mr. Corbina
A spokesman for Mr Corbina stated that he "stood in respectful silence" and acknowledged the "heroism" of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, a member of the shadow cabinet, Mr. Corbina Owen Smith said on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "independently" from his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in a team of Mr. Corbina, voicing disagreement on issues of the economy, defence and international policy, whereas less than one sixth of the members of the parliamentary party backed him as leader.
BBC Political correspondent Robin Brant says that political divisions are also "pile" in the Labour Party after the appointment of Mr Corbina position in the European Union and the government compensation restrictions.
Mr. Corbin said at a conference of Trade unions, the Labour Party introduced amendments aimed at abolishing the idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow minister for Work and pensions said that the party is "full clarity" on account of the fact that it was only in opposition to the government's plans to reduce the upper limit from 26 000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will become the fifth leader of Labour with which David Cameron will meet the "mailbox" over the past ten years since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says that he "drew collective resources" in order to gain ideas of questions Mr Cameron MP and received more than 30 000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from a district North said that questions the Prime Minister cause excessive confrontation, and that he would refrain from witty responses and exchange hot verbal jabs, instead pledging to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Eagle, the shadow Economics Minister, will replace him on the issues, when he will be absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea to allow other colleagues to take the word with the possibility, saying that he addressed the house of Commons speaker John Bercow to discuss this issue.
After becoming leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to withdraw from the political style "fair" is often associated with the procedure of questions to the prime Minister, but acknowledged a few years later that he failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, questions to the prime Minister have become a key indicator of the views of the leader, their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say that this has turned into a caricature and requires large-scale reforms.

The share market has fallen since 2010 from 18 to 14 percent, and revenue from the food business, which the company supplies approximately 1,200 retailers, fell 43 percent compared to 2012 due to operational and due to pressure on sales and profitability indicators.
Nevertheless, the company does not surrender, spending more than $150 million annually for the sake of equalization of retail prices with prices in weekly and a thousand positions and helping retailers in rebuilding trading platforms, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider choice of branded food products.

Tennis Australia President Steve Healy supports
Kokkinakis deserves a medal, not criticism for his behavior.
Kokkinakis indirectly suffered a recent scandal around his friend Nick and for his behavior deserves honour more than critics, says Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in the talented duo and often called the "Special Ks", unwittingly found himself in the spotlight because of a shameful saga with Stan at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly afterwards, during a hot qualification match in a Cincinnati Judge on the steeple had twice apart Ryan and his opponent, Harrison claimed: "Wawrinka was supposed to lay on the blades, but I must put this guy on the blades."
Since the last time they saw the racquet after Gasquet cramp in his leg saved from possible defeat at the US Open, Healy faithfully defends.
The boy is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Sea for the right to be second after Bernard in the singles in the Davis Cup semifinal against the United Kingdom.
"I was keenly excited about one thing, namely that pulled into the conflict," said Healy.
He really broke a racket when he drove a leg at the US Open, but he is not the first player who hopes to break my racket when it broke down, and I know well enough to be sure that he would not be proud.
But actually he owned a very well in fairly provocative situations for US, by, etc., and I'm sure he deserves trust.
A great team around him, he has a lovely family, and I just think it came a bit dishonest.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works a lot, perfectly fits into the team, he had never had problems with the other players respect him outside the court, he intensively trained, he is in excellent shape, he is very purposeful and well-developed young man, and I think that it should appreciate.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive for the sake of an important match, which begins on Friday, believing the "mutual consent" in the right way for all, but expecting that guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all we want the team fully focused on the match and not the disputes around [the]," said Healy.
And I think that Nick gained momentum very quickly, that prove people like Federer career and he grows on the eyes of the public, he made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to help him realize the consequences of their actions, and should, I believe, to withdraw him from the center of attention for some time so that he could reflect on them, and it is best for the team and best for him.
Immigration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, delays migrants
Announcing a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia on the southern border and stops those who try to enter the country illegally to keep flowing inward flow of migrants.
The unrest occurred on the border - hundreds of migrants collected on a border that negatively reacted sharply to the Serbian authorities.
Anchored indefinitely on the stretch of road between the two countries "points, people fleeing armed violence at home, smashed tents and settled on this terrain.
However, frustration mounted.
When a police helicopter started over them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and hurled insults at the Hungarian police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister declared "inadmissible" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, when they are more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
It is necessary to negotiate with Brussels in the coming days, and other countries, "said Ivica Dačić in Prague.
Unrest on the border began the next day after a bloc of 28 countries could not develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to bear the overall responsibility for 40 000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future (next month or by the end of the year) will be agreed, according to which the member States of the EU will take another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded the EU Emergency summit to gather next week to discuss the immigration crisis that has gripped the continent.
Hungary, however, hopes for quick action on the part of Brussels or neighbors.
On Tuesday declared a state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers in actions against the crisis, enabling them to block the road and accelerate the asylum court cases.
Meanwhile, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Peter declared that his country is also planning to build a fence of barbed wire on the border with Romania, to halt the flow of migrants across the country now, when she finished the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie stated that even the prisoners were connected to the urgent work on the completion of the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary became the main "bottleneck" and EU border crossing point for migrants, many of whom are refugees - the victims of wars in Syria and Middle East countries.
Nevertheless, the country's prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants, looking for a more prosperous life, not refugees - the victims of military action that have the right to protection, and this view is sharply at odds with the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws introduced in Hungary into force at midnight, now considered a crime crossing or damage 4-метрового (13-футового) barbed wire fence, built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include more lengthy prison terms for the accused of trafficking.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovács told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We clearly have a message: illegal border crossings - a crime.
Formally, the Parliament still must approve the placement of military forces that are expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters who are on the border, within several days watching there, the presence of armed to the teeth with military vehicles and dogs.
György, Orban's national security adviser, reported finding the authorized bodies about 45 people attempting to cross the border, the border, and another 15 people - inside the country.
They crossed the border, breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities quickly restore the fence.
The Hungarian government on Tuesday morning also closed two of seven passes on the border with Serbia, driving to block one of the passes railway carriage, barbed wire.
The unrest erupted at the main passage across the border near the town of (Hungary), because the Hungarians put border patrol the premises for people inside the metal container, and crowds of people pressed each other to cut inside.
Managed to penetrate roughly 20 people, thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main], leading from Serbia to Hungary, and announced the refusal of food and water until their not to miss in Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold the two-digit advantage in the race for the nomination for Democrats across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent among primary (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to participate in the presidential race, receives the support of 15 percent of primary.
For more than five months before the start of competition in the primary election, most say that it is too early to say that they are certain about a candidate who will support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in their choices than other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton holds a big advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has shrunk.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is lagging behind it by just 5 points.
The preference for Clinton to 50 years disappeared, and they are now on an equal footing with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton Sanders on a two-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
Almost half of the primary across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the candidate of this party.
A quarter would have backed it with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her just because she is a candidate.
Six percent did not support it.
Perhaps it is not surprising that the current Clinton supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm at her expense.
Among those who currently supports Clinton, more contradictory views - only about a quarter of it would support with enthusiasm.
While 48 percent of the primary say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer say the same about their leader, Prime Minister Donald (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters is an open question, why do they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer - that it has the right experience (16 percent), then that time is now a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also say the Association linking her with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also called on and chances of election.
Because the vice President is contemplating potential participation in the election, 57 percent of primary wish that he joined the race - although one third said that he should not.
When asked who they would like to see the second place among candidates from the party primary in most cases called Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half said that they would chose Biden's second, is more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek re-election from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among participants race up to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent see Clinton the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, this figure fell from 78 percent in the last month.
This gives Biden a landslide second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate, has increased.
Nevertheless, answering the question, what is most important in a candidate, choose other options besides the chance to be elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates is not a nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have shown good results in some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
The majority believes Clinton, Sanders and Biden honest and credible people with good leadership qualities.
Biden from all three leads on honesty, and a strong side of Clinton in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of the primary does not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, two times more than those who say the same thing about (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have a certain opinion about him on this score.
The primary also generally consider similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden.
On all these measures, about a quarter do not have any opinion about it.
Although questions regarding personal e-mail inbox and server at Hillary Clinton when her Secretary of State continues, most of the primary are satisfied with her explanation on this score and believe that this is not affected negatively on their general opinion about her.
But this is a different story from the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans now ensure its explanation, and only about one-third are satisfied.
Public opinion divided about this back in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy over the e-mail had not affected their general opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent say their opinion of her has worsened.
It is mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who argue that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considered fair and credible voters from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month and 15 compared with May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider her honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not believe Trump honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump both, however, are getting good marks for quality.
Of the six tested candidates Biden, Carson and Bush show the best result for honesty.
Most see a more honest man than not, but how about Carson, many have no opinion about him.
Margin of error for a sample of 351 primary is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of a national survey Ben Carson closely approached Donald
Ben Carson closely approached Donald in a recent CBS / New York Times poll
These two candidates scored half of the votes in the new poll, leaving everyone else looking for support under the feet
Across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose support rate increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll, conducted on the eve of the debate on Fox News last month, up to 27% in the poll conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson has soared during the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoys support across all demographic groups, overtake Trump in a group with higher education.
The rest of the candidates, with the exception of Carly and Ohio Governor John, back together with the governor of Wisconsin Scott, whose support has fallen from 10% in the past month to 2% now.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Senator from Florida, Marco Rubio together occupy third place with 6 percent.
Margin of error for the sample of 376 in this newest survey is plus or minus 6%, the survey was conducted in September.
A recent CNN / ORC poll, published last week, showed the growth of Carson in the polls - showing 19% support among Republicans, with 32 percent support for Trump.
The latest ABC News / Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is substantially ahead of Carson.
In connection with the growth of Carson's support last week, Trump made a few critical attacks against the former, even when Carson apologized for questioned Trump's faith.
"We need the energy," said Trump last Saturday during a closing campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused in the death of freshman College
About two years later, after the death of a college student during a fraternity ritual dedications in the mountains in Pennsylvania murder charges against five people were nominated.
"Members of the PI Delta Psi Fraternity from New York College brutally attacked Michael Chan" during a rite-of-passage in September 2013 and took him to hospital on time, that caused his death, "police said.
Officials say the student blindfolded and 30-фунтовым backpack with sand behind pushed several times while he was trying to achieve a goal, going on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the fraternity Pi Delta Psi did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and presumably still waited an hour before delivering it to the hospital, police say.
They, however, found time to change clothes, find Google his symptoms and contact with Andy, national president of the brotherhood, to ask the council, told a news conference police chief Chris Wagner.
"At this moment of brotherhood members began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the brotherhood above the health of Michael," said Chef Wagner.
He could not save, and he died the next morning.
According to a report on the showdown, Deng received some blunt head injuries, torso and hips.
"Too many families have suffered as a result of the initiation rituals in the brotherhood, because at least one student dies during them every year since 1970," said in a statement, Douglas, a lawyer representing the family of Deng.
The Brotherhood and their members should be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Monroe County jurors bent in favour of third degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr., will receive an accusation of violence against a newcomer and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to bring to justice not only the individual members, but if there is an organization that sanctioned all this formally or informally," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
The College has banned the brotherhood, and the nationwide brotherhood excluded from their local branch structure.
What happens when the Fed raises interest rates
Raising rates will happen, and "bull market" stumbles, bond yields will rise and the economy Fali into recession.
We know this.
What we don't know is how long it will take before, and how long it will continue.
Specifically for the economy history explains a little about the time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hikes and a whopping 86 months.
The stiffness of the Federal Reserve raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the US Central Bank administration so insistently underscores that investors should not focus on when he starts to raise rates, but how many will take the adaptation.
Indeed, lots of variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss around raising rates is exaggerated.
"The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, Chief International economic specialist at Capital Economics, in his comments to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return to more normal interest rates in the United States, but still low levels will be seismic impulse, which many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a look at how the economy could respond in some areas, depending on the historical trends:
As the market has already seen over the last month or so, the expectation of rising rates could lead to instability for some time.
In raising rates, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It is unlikely that income from shares in a halt on 12-24 months after the first leap that, again, probably reflects a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study, the results of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
If more specifically, the market for the last approximately 35 years often changes dramatically - about 14 percent - in the direction of higher rates, remains smooth enough for 250 days after this (the average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returning to normalcy with an average yield of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob, chief specialist in stock trading strategies in Asset Management, published in May 's.
Deutsche said that the result for securities tends to not immediately become more pronounced at the stage of raising rates, and income from stocks begin to shrink.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but raising rates often play contribute to them.
In this case the Federal Reserve put in such conditions that had not existed before and can accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be almost at their lowest point in the history of higher rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, the nominal rates since 1950 only twice annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few believe that it is a long time, in the third quarter, he stays at the level of just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates on such unstable economic background may be risky and raises the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants are bracing for the Federal Reserve raising rates throughout the year, with their view chained to the meeting of the Federal Open market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many experts on strategies and economists believe that the FOMC could approve a rate hike at this session, futures trading suggests only 25-процентной probabilities.
"In our study since 1950 all cycles of rate hikes until today were ranging from a widening financial leverage when GDP can peaks, biting rhymes, recession, very quickly after the start of the recovery," the report says.
In contrast, it was a very slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle at the moment is that the Fed waited since the end of the last recession; the record amounted to 35 months, only he lasts already 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become unstable as the market expects to raise rates, and this scenario is in some ways similar to the one that is being implemented for the shares.
The crucial difference is that in effect for bonds faster than for stocks when the Federal system changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds it seems that yield changes the vector immediately after the onset of the first raising / reducing rates in the cycle.
At the end of a cycle of rate increases, bond yields are falling immediately, "Deutsche said.
The strategy of Charles Schwab specialists believe that raising rates would lead to what levels of long-term and short-term bond yields converge, making the curve more of a flat.
High yield bonds often behave better in this climate, though "we still fear the fluctuations in yield," reads the study, Kathy Jones, Fixed income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the policy of the Federal System.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and a fall in inflation expectations, there are signs that the market is the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans rose, the yield curve more flat, credit spreads widened, increased volatility - all the characteristics of the market with policy tightening of the Federal System.
Speaking in general, companies, leading the main business in the United States, will benefit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with lots of debt would be worse off, as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, and their debt is more expensive - financially.
"History shows that" qualitative "actions demonstrate the effectiveness of the above market within three months after the initial rate hikes," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
The company with a stable financial condition outperformed companies with unstable condition on the results of each rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004, an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high yield capital, as well as stocks with low volatility also showed better efficiency than low quality stocks, on average, 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
The debt will be a big question.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to the pure transactions, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Depositors could also see profits through higher yields, although experts disagree about how quickly it will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM," says Andrew, a member of parliament from the Conservative
Conservative member of Parliament Andrew criticized the station for "lowering standards"
Proves that it becomes less commercial competitor
Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying simply that the prize with
A colleague at the Parliament authority Collins that had befallen The Voice with the same criticism was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," - said the leader of the members of parliament, prompting the company to prove that it does anything that commercial companies do not.
Andrew, a member of Parliament from the Conservative leadership also told the BBC that it seems like public radio "and becomes less from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word" simplification "- but it seems she is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards prize launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else - here are two examples that I first came to mind, in which you actually just copy what you already have on the market, "said Mr..
The BBC Director General, rejected the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and education audiences.
What I know thanks to Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and the creation of music actually compares more with anybody.
"Also really very important, I think the interest of Radio 3 in search of new music and in the promotion of new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that the radio station must work much harder to attract audience than in the past, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, BBC Radio 3 was not the sole brainchild, which have been attacked for their commercial rivals during the hearings on the heels of the Special Committee on Culture, media and sport.
A member of Parliament from Tory Damien Collins has attacked The Voice is a music talent show, which the BBC bought the Dutch Talpa Media for the estimated price of £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed in connection with the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall says that the BBC 1 Show, in which the judges involved Paloma Faith and Boy George, was done in the typical style of the BBC. "
He added that he wants from the Corporation to "found a hit in their own home stables" next time she will run entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent commissioned new seasons of The Voice in the future or use the money of those who pay the license fee to other entertainment formats.

Drivers have received an order from the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojša Stepanovich assures that his country is doing everything in her power to help the refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to provide a humane attitude towards them.
But it is a common European problem.
It is not easy to solve, no country in Europe alone it fails to do so, and the more such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open border for refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's:
If someone is a refugee named in Serbia, he should fill out the necessary documents.
And if he fails to do so, and in our country it is not ulsever said. Because Serbia is quite safe.
Hungary already has enthroned 175-тикилометровый fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to build a similar fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that it is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis for several years was a center-right government, which, in the opinion of the left, the country to the financial crisis.
Now he has become the temporary leader of the New democracy party, is challenging.
A few days before the election, he met a journalist at euronews.
euronews: Mr, welcome to euronews.
Vangelis: Thank you for the invitation.
euronews: Nine months ago your party failed resoundingly, relinquishing the SYRIZA coalition, but now, judging by the polls, New Democracy "equal to her popularity.
What has changed during this time?
Vangelis: Greece has changed, and we too.
Mr. Tsipras many lied last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and growth prospects.
The country has now again fiscal deficits and high unemployment.
Investors are gone because Mr. Tsipras chased them.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have been able to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promise of mister.
And now they can easily compare the promised with what really happened.
Daily life has become markedly worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and it concerned the majority of Greek citizens.
euronews: But you say that in the event of election victory will seek alliances with other parties, including.
Vangelis: the point is that, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where acted or still operate the rescue program, the political forces and all the ruling parties came together in order to implement the program, on which they have reached a consensus, without abandoning its political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
euronews: Your party voted in support of the agreement between the Master and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new prime Minister on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis: we actually voted for the movement of Greece to the European way, because well imagine what ruinous consequences would have led the country out of the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have the solidarity funds, Juncker and aid package in the banking sector.
All this would be lost if there was no agreement with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were a result of how Mr. Tsipras negotiated.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government during the first year of power wants to restore order, acting rationally and gives to understand that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure all accepted obligations that cannot be met due to the fact that lead to recession, may again be the subject of negotiations, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be a mistake to assume that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our lenders, because they expect the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their confidence, we must continue to privatization, reforms and structural changes that were agreed, while continuing to enjoy the benefits of financing the EU and exciting investment opportunities that we must open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of negotiations, the Government has not provided any serious arguments on many key political issues that we found out when discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give an example, associated with the incomes of farmers.
We have explained our European partners that we are not talking about a fixed monthly income, and therefore he may not fully be taxed in advance.
We responded that ministers never talked about it.
That is, Greek ministers were not prepared and poorly informed, but because the unfortunate unsuccessfully negotiated and signed the agreement.
euronews: If you defeat at the polls, you will find yourself at the same table with Mr Juncker, Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will this be what you tell them, from what they told your predecessor Antonis Samaras?
Vangelis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we were trying to best fulfill the 2012 agreement, bypassing the parishes in sharp angles.
We pushed forward reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extreme circumstances.
The market fell, and it was not visible to potential buyers willing to pay the price, the Greek government.
I was the speaker of the parliament at the time, I managed to reconcile the views of three parliamentary groups comprising then majorities.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, and this in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations held outside.
And we managed to steer the country to a normal situation, which would have continued to improve, if the process was not interrupted by envisaging extraordinary general elections, all the result of December's presidential elections.
euronews: Last week on the territory of Greece is moving a mass flow of refugees.
What do you think about this situation, and the reaction of European countries that aspire to these people?
Vangelis: refugee crisis is a ticking time bomb, which we have to deal with after the election victory.
And the reason is that the SYRIZA government not acted in this situation as they should have done.
In such matters, you should act on the hyperbole, because if the problem is catching up with you, remain the only emergency measures.
And we are now in this situation.
Even the interim government, in just seven days has done more than Mr Tsipras has done for seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which provides valuable assistance to the president of the republic, called a summit of the EU will find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and note - illegal immigrants are not refugees.
It is the victims of the war in Syria, the victim of some extraordinary events with them.
This issue has a deeply humanitarian aspect, and we'll stick with the position that European politicians should take in this new situation.
The decision should be taken at the EU summit, should be involved and the United Nations.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee reception centres.
We must also effectively use the economic assistance that we get from the EU in order to be able to deal with this pressing issue.
euronews: Mr, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis: Thank you.

After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later in the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note which says that he "regrets" about the first murder and would like to "all return back to the" competent organs reported Tuesday.
Police in the town of Gautier, Mississippi, reports that a teacher of geography and social Sciences at the University of the State of the Delta, called 911 about 10 a.m. service.
Monday and reported that he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that police need to send people to his home.

The police asked the name, but he did not tell him.
Lamb has not explained why he opened fire.
Arriving at the scene of the crime, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss there, 41 years, and written from the hands of note from Lamba, 45 years in which he said: "I'm sorry, I would like to return everything back.

Stars who have lost their luck
The actor (left), pictured with his son (right), has gone through several difficult years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing companion life Farra Fawcett, from cancer.
Reportedly, the actor also suffered from addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All this has certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United is playing for a few months because of the double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is on the matter, which will not be able to get on the field at least for six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that the Show will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during the reckless Hector Moreno in the 15th minute, when PSV 20-year-old Shaw burst into the penalty area.
He assisted on the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He had a double fracture, and he is in hospital.
It will be carried to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then cured.
This is awful - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and began playing fantastically, and then it happened.
In the locker room there was an oxygen mask.
He wept.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it is six months, and the guy will not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he will be able to play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he had not received a red card and a penalty was not scheduled.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli has not punished the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes the Italian judge erred.
Judge for yourselves, when I say that it is a penalty and a red card.
It was a tackle too evil with two legs.
In his Twitter Shaw writes: "Thank you all for your messages, words cannot describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery starts, I will come back even stronger than it was."
Still on the topic: Manchester United is experiencing unhappiness with Luke Shaw in defeat in a game with PSV
The English defender will have an additional incentive to recover in time for the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "This is a very heavy injury."
When any player leaves with a similar injury, everything is very upset by this.
It was never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Wang Galya at 2014 World Cup
"Now it is very difficult for him, because he had no intention to injure an opponent, and when you hear that this is a very severe injury, you feel unwell," Coca said.
I had no opportunity to see the moment itself.
The only thing that I could see, this ball, who flew in a different direction, so that it looked like he (Moreno) touched him, but I have not seen under Lucas.
In a conversation with SBS6 Moreno said: "I know what it is, I know how difficult it is to endure.
It is very difficult for me, and I am very sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also taken to hospital after a clash with Chris.
Whether David Cameron "knows" something else?
Every parent getting one thing very quickly: if your child liked a book, will take a little time before you know it almost by heart.
Probably, unless you are David Cameron.
Answering the question of the representative of the company, dealing with the organization children rest in the holidays, about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "the lorax" is a fairy tale with a environmental bent, written by Dr. in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a commentary published on the company's website, and continues: "This funny, touching, unusual history with a strong message I love to read to their children, because it always reveals any image or message that we have omitted."
And all would be well, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly narrates the contents of the notebook, but actually tells the story of the same movie, filmed in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify a fairly short original narrative.
"In a city surrounded by high walls, where there was no greenery and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - girls of their dreams, performing her desire to see this tree," we read in the text description of love stories, unknown to Dr. (real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, died in 1991.
If it looks suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads almost like a summary of the plot of the movie "The lorax" on the website of the Internet Movie Database: "Surrounded by high walls in the city, where everything was artificial and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - girls of their dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being, admittedly, an active parent is so unfamiliar with the contents of the notebook, which is not named for the boy learns about how destroys the environment of trees and "greedy", despite the protests (whose name is rendered in the name of the book) is a ridiculous creature with a mustache, who "speaks on behalf of the trees."
Most likely, such a simple was assigned to an artist, never a child a book about 20 times in a row.
Downing Street spokesman said that the text was allegedly obtained from the office of Cameron in the constituency.
The company confirmed that the text was received from the staff of Cameron, but there was no further comment.
For Adam Lita clearly existed a risk not to get into the England squad, but it is still a complicated issue
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is no easy task, but if you look at the team that England had selected for this tour, the repetition of the defeat in the test series with the score 3-0, what happened last time, does not seem likely to me.
I would also not deny the victory on the field.
Cook's team, perhaps less experienced than it was three years ago, but it is among the players available, masterly host balls and collective thinking badly; they do not bring with them scars from 2012, but only junior positive.
Moen Ali turns with the ball, promising balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for test level, represents your aggressive option.
Still on the topic: Adam Lit your test dropped out of the England Cricket team and replaced by Alex
The decision on the exclusion of Adam Lita me, his head coach at Yorkshire, "of course, it is difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and obvious, but the brutal reality is that cricket players are evaluated by judges on the outcome.
There were no questions on John 1924, for example, that led to this announcement, because (and I have said this before) best players choose themselves.
The couple, and Lita could wait over a long career, but he was in the power of their own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more for "Yorkshire", there will be another opportunity.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, delightedly about his good mood, even when he showed what is capable of, and it does not surprise me; he is first and foremost a team player, and then everything else.
The question is, how long before that test cricket will leave the impression - a tricky question.
Lit played in seven games as Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton - in nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on her and on another field.
The only thing that you could complain - that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League, when Lit was in peak form, but this lost opportunity already in the past.
Alex appears, and I'm highly.
He is unpredictable, and that we have seen in the club at the beginning of this season, when he earned 236 in the match against us at Trent Bridge that was already something.
He should be at least given the same opportunity as those who came before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting the Moena next as an opening that would give an opportunity to introduce an additional, keeping four high-speed, considering, and I'm not against it.
See no reason why springing a player cannot hit the ball there, and this lefty has already shown that he is fucking good.
Moen, perhaps not exactly what you need for your county of Worcestershire, but became the third number for them, and there is a big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches "third" before going out as a curtain-raiser in 2001.
He won three hundred immediately and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the national team as reserve spinner picked, and in my conversations with him sometime, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his approximate statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and to think that this is a risky bet, but among the voting "for" a little bit, and chose the youth.
He will learn a lot from this tour.
In addition to the team, England is planning to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment, as a consultant for the test matches, could be a brilliant move.
He is one of the best guys for the game, which will bring her vast experience gained under all possible conditions and in any of the attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and provides both energy and ruthless pace.
I always felt that he was born to be in international cricket, whether playing or coaching job and has a considerable intellect.
Sometimes a new voice in the locker room, even if they say what has been said previously, can give new strength to the team.
Collie colleague Ben Stokes of Durham team left for mayflies inside me, to be given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, do not have this problem.
Although not all agree, coaches and players do not determine the schedule.
And you must remember as players, their position will depend on results.
Such decisions are never easy.
The camp of supporters of Britain's exit from the EU could win if the economy will be depressed by 2017
David Cameron's ill-advised policy to resume talks about keeping Britain in the EU every day feels more and more difficulties, even without looking at the election of the brilliant "yes or no?" - the Labour Leader Corbina or TUC indignation about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbina and.
Friendly European diplomat explained recently that position, which is now the EU to play a variety of crises - not all of them own manufacture - some member states are fed up with the British self-centred agenda strife concessions and undermine agreement changes, which they mostly don't want.
Gathering in Brighton for the annual meeting, TUC decided that he does not want them in any case if they destroy social protection.
We could even call it the "Dave and George" program.
The prime Minister and Finance Minister ride on J8 and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the backdrop of the famous local monument, in the company of local celebrities or without it, then come home and say that they attract allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to concerned in maintaining external contacts to Britain under the awning of the EU - "Not us along with France," says Berlin - suggests that ministers and officials in some capitals have reached an understanding when they will anyway, we will stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation worsens for her, as she deteriorated for the who in its place Thatcher (11 years), (14) and Kohl (16).
French President François Hollande faces local or replacement in 2017.
He, too, is losing strength.
Poland may soon get a right-wing nationalist government, Spain is left.
Hard to see them from the skin out to help "" whose energy could be spent on preventing the exit of Scotland from the UK - what they didn't want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So that some such ministers may even plan the issuance of deliberately useless in the style of the SNP during the referendum campaign in Britain in 2017 to spur the process of UK exit from the EU, suggests my friend.
"The review was" and "Britain" has not received anything of value from the renewed talks.
The Europeans on their trouble know what a predator may be fleet street, and as a skeptical towards the EU are media moguls, unlike the times of Tony Referendum in 1975, which supported our accession in 1973, the ratio of 2: 1.
They may dimly remember Boris Johnson, an inveterate plaque with their "straight bananas" EU Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
For all its stupidity Ed knew who his enemies.
They included colorful company from neophytes tax crooks, telephone and who own most of our major newspapers.
Indeed, Tony Blair was absolutely of the same opinion about them, but it is understood that when you are in a cage with lush gorilla, you should give her bananas to distract her and not let it eat you for lunch and tea.
In fact Blair was a better defender than Blair himself in opposition to Cameron's idea about a referendum, because Blair lost principles in favour of the EU constitution by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which issued him a winning ticket.
The press had not forgiven that killer anything from him.
But, after Jeremy Corbin, who has a friendly pat me on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he no longer has time to spend it on me - it seems that risks repeating the strategy of Nile Merdoku "boycott" of the 1980s - a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy of interaction with the press - not with me, but certainly with Andrew, on whose couch in the Air Force he sat on Sunday.
The official position of Corbina in Europe - this is what I call sensitively.
He says he wants us to remain in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside Ukip tendencies and a wider range of "little England" among Tory supporters would probably say "yes."
This is the same thing that Benn "but not" said on radio and TV this week, his inner boy scout struggling refused to admit that the appointment of ZAC Efron of his terrible John "shadow" Finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminds me of the 1970s, when his struggling fought on TV for disloyalty to the country cabinet colleagues, without going too far and not losing his post in the Cabinet.
The Battle of Hilary was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "under any circumstances" - a phrase - not that Benn, Mcdonnell said, and not what J. K. and members of Parliament spoke at a private meeting on Monday evening, according to popular belief.
To get there, neither wanted to tell the Democrat and "their guy" Corbin - remember he even touched me - discipline messages remains important in the age of 24-hour TV seven days a week, and especially in the maelstrom of social networks, the hearth of paranoia and betrayal.
It is prudent not to give Cameron so just to get away from Europe, allowing it to take for granted the support of Labour during the referendum campaign, Mcdonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the fundamental error and Corbina about EU membership - as part of the "economy" besieged fortress - is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among leftist dissidents, for whom narcissism, generated by a slight difference, is a central principle in doctrinal disputes.
As for his delusions about NATO - Tom Watson is determined that will not agitate for an exit - foreign diplomats are required to try to bring it up to their managers at home.
Why Paris or Berlin to spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - concessions to Britain, when everything can be meaningless?
The US is already quite disappointed with the weak British military action in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory government in power cuts back on spending, as I was reminded on Monday during a lunch at some forum called British Influence Security.
Experts have criticized the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
Funded by the Government agency claims that electronic cigarettes 95% less harmful than smoking, a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, according to the researchers.
Experts, publish in the British Medical Journal (Lancet) in conjunction with savaged the evidence used by the agency Public Health England (electronically) in its report - tobacco.
Published an important report - "turning milestone" last month, calling him a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the accuracy of the data and some experts pointed to the connection with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month savaged "extremely shaky argument" on the basis of which has constructed its main conclusion.
In the article, the two researchers asked whether these statements under a "solid or vagrant foundation."
Martin Mckee, professor of European public Health organization at the London School of Hygiene and tropical medicine, and Simon, Professor of clinical Epidemiology at the University of Gingold's, said: "The Fundamental principle of health - the rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
According to them, the public expects to claim that "the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes by about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking" were based on a detailed parsing of evidence and modeling.
In fact, it is removed from the meeting only 12 people gathered to develop a model of decision-making analysis in order to consolidate their opinions about the harm associated with various products; the results of the meeting briefly in scientific publications.
Mckee and reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called Health, whose director general reported that he previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent investigation.
He also confirmed the certificates of BAT in healthcare in the sustainability report.
One of 12 people at the meeting announced the funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, not mentioning the funding, which he reportedly had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the choice of the members of the Council were not given, but there are a few well-known advocates of electronic cigarettes, some of which also announced funding in the publishing industry.
It is not known whether other participants in the meeting experience in tobacco control.
The meeting also visited the head of tobacco directions.
The scientific article published by the group, "gracefully agrees" with the fact that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria," wrote and Mckee.
However, none of these links and restrictions were not affected by the report.
Mckee and told that statements that "at the moment there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, inciting children to smoking or non-smoking," are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and well-being in directions, told that statements previously were given answers.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking.
One of the two whole life died from his addiction.
All evidence suggest that the health threats from electronic cigarettes is relatively small, but we must continue to explore distant consequences.
Have a clear duty to inform the public about what to show and what not to prove these proofs, especially where the public have been doubts about the relative risk compared with tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from diseases related to smoking, but smoking costs the NHS 2 billion pounds a year.
Clearly delineate the obvious - that although electronic cigarettes and are not safe, they are only part of the harm caused by smoking - we carry out our tasks in front of the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 believes that the company should stop the BBC series Eastenders
The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop issuing such programmes as Eastenders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would give much for such successful shows as a soap opera about the "Albert Square."
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used for the creation of such programs, which are not produced by other British TV and radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for the fact that the company puts the transfer of public broadcasting, which certainly looks only a small part of the audience at the peak airtime when competitors go to the show with a high rating, and on such channels as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson remarked that he had for six years unsuccessfully tried to establish cooperation with the BBC during work on Channel 4.
"I can't get away from the idea that the BBC is preparing to launch and transfer broadcasts that could show the competing companies not receiving subsidies," Johnson told the house of Lords Communications Committee members within the framework of the clarification of the fate of the BBC.
If you save the license fee that I don't think a good solution in the medium and long term, the company should be left on the air only those programs that are not and are not produced by other companies.
The Show goes on the air in The Voice, because the creators want to get the greatest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else did not show it, and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I do not understand why regressive taxes should go to funding programs that could without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, Eastenders - another; admittedly, they have their own production.
Other channels, surely, would have given her a lot.
I do not understand how it can be public service broadcasting.
I do not think that this is somehow the BBC.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed the Canal Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of "quest for ratings because of the ambitions of employees and because of their belief that this is the best way to get support for a long time."
His comments about the most popular shows on the BBC comments resonate with Sky Executive Director Tony Bolla, who lectures in his memory in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested the BBC sell TV series like Eastenders.
Johnson noted that more niche transmission of BBC public character "continue to go on BBC4, where it is often impossible to assess the audience, but the function of the company performed, and it could be arraigned as an argument in badge sermons justifying the income from licensing fees of 4 billion pounds:" Well yes, of course, we do all these incoherent transfer that nobody watches. "
They put them in the slot where nobody ever will be watching them.
About the license fee Johnson told the Committee: "I urge you to find a better system for those who will receive the most from it.
Of course, we all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year - a huge amount, but for people for whom £150 is a lot of money, I wonder, they believe because they don't really watch and listen to the BBC.
The former Executive director of channels Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should review the mission of Rita in favor of ", and".
He noted that only a small portion of the material produced by the BBC is now formally classified as educational - according to him, this 1% TV content and 0.1% on the radio - and that the company must catch the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto ", and".
On issues of partnership ELSTEIN noticed that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "Proms" (only some of them, he says, is shown on TV), as well as to enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
"" allows you to manage brain cells using sound waves
On the video, you can see how nematodes changing direction when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists put the worms with genetically modified nervous system, which can be controlled using sound waves.
Tiny nematodes changing direction at a time when they are affected by sound pulses, too high to the human ear could hear them.
Pulses have an impact through the activation of neurons, genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on the topic: Researchers control brain activity with light
Scientists said that worms demonstrate the capabilities of the new technique, called "" the essence of which is the use of ultrasound for excitation of certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, the ultrasound source is located outside the body.
:, researcher at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure, in which a person is sent electrical impulses in the brain and that is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Usually do not react to ultrasound, but found that they started to react when they were placed in a liquid that contains microscopic bubbles.
He discovered that the bubbles enhance ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the body of worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect structures called "TRP-4 channels" found in the membranes of certain cells to worms.
Ultrasound waves are forcing these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
For the creation of hookworms, which can be controlled by ultrasound, made the genetic modifications of worms, so their motor neurons TRP-4 used ion channels.
During the use of ultrasound for influencing the modified organisms sound waves reinforced microscopic bubbles and organisms in worms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one that is applied in a "new direction" - which allows scientists to enable or disable neurons using light pulses.
Claims that compared with this methodology may have some advantages.
In contrast to the light, which is delivered to the desired area of the brain by fiber optics, low-frequency ultrasound waves freely pass through the tissues of the body, so for their delivery does not need to be inside the cranial boxes.
"We believe that for the treatment of some neurological diseases in clinical conditions using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to do at the time, developed the human neurons sensitive to signal," said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and cells.

Advertisements abuse of British Arms trade
See Amnesty International video protesting against arms exhibition.
Stunning!
Distractive Crus iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric batons, causing unbearable pain, but sparing no trace!
Cheerful voice and traditional animation leave no doubt that this advertising is the largest international exhibition of arms - parody, prepared by Amnesty International in order to draw attention to the intention of the British government "push" weapons to repressive regimes using the passing in the center of the Excel exhibition of defense technologies and security systems.
Another topic: Arms show: authoritarian regimes are going to London
But the special campaign also leads to a sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and in subway trains that need to look at them again.
"An important announcement, riding along the lines of the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" - is written on one of them with the London underground font download DLR line, silhouette in the tank.
In September this year a crowd of arms traders coming on line passengers are asked to help prevent arms exhibition.
300 posters drawn by artists who displayed their work in the "Museum of Cruel design" in the park "Banksy."
The team, called the Group "a special Patrol" helped to distribute them to London, using a set of "cracker" advertising spots, 6-фунтовый set of keys, which claimed "gives access to roughly one-third of the advertising space on bus stops on the planet."
London's No such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the ads produced by a Group of "Special Patrol".
According to, the curator of the exhibition Cruel Designs and a teacher at the University, the artists are becoming more demanding and seek to convey political art to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists are starting to work with activists protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of their art, if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the arms exhibition, passengers in the subway.
Video from Amnesty was seen more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by the agency, working pro bono, with the involvement of the graphic designer and artist, also working for free.
Creative Director Matt lever was impressed by advertising silence around arms exhibition - with skip in Excel calendar - and thought: "Let's arrange them campaign, which they are trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and astute gamble corporate advertising, but "to fill her house with bright colors and animation turned out to be a more exciting occupation."
"They are incredibly helped us to draw attention to the sale of illegal children equipment at the show," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
Now we need to ensure that the UK government adopted measures and ensured that this equipment will not be sold illegally right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art exhibition on the subject of arms comes from inside the Excel, where participants traded fantastic products.
In a press release Saab disclosed information about the order "AT4CS RS for firing from the shoulder," incoming from the US army.
It includes a "unique cumulative head part that brings the unbeatable action inside the goal."
Whatever he did, it would not be pleasant.
Eight Golden rules to stay in student dormitories
Already it had been 11 years since I moved into a dormitory as a normal 19-year-old man, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but only now I recall strained smiles of those whom I rankled - and numerous, long complaints on the other.
Mostly what I learned can be put on eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can vary from slightly acting on nerves to absolutely fearsome.
He urges talk: tell people where you are, if you took a leave of absence and where it is spent, Corbina do you support and why you "honestly, neither love nor hate," "because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract, HAHAHA, I will have."
.
And help others to take a break, too - ask questions and show interest.
This supports the conversation and helps you find people who you like, rather than those with whom you would not even talk to, even if you have eyelashes caught fire, and they would have handed out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
Room people often turn to drinking establishments, movie theaters and places of public gatherings, but they also place where people dress and underwear.
Still on the topic: Don't even think of starting his studies at university, being in a relationship
It is unfair to include universities.
Your room should be a haven, but many dormitories form a culture of dysfunction from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to a long friendship.
It can be hell for those who are trying to regain power.
Nothing in culture does not allow you to say: "I like You, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to left, and I was able to recover the energy that I spent on communication with you."
Try to feel when other tired updating. bathroom shabby communication - and not to him, and send an SMS.
By the way, on: do it.
One guy in my dormitory followed such a principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends with baking.
Because you start university life at the peak of the popularity of the show, knocking on the door to the people, to introduce himself and offer a dollop of chocolate biscuits - not such a strange effect, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we are neighbors, I did something to you, and now smile and I'm going to ask you some personal questions."
Offer homemade treats - a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to chat with you, and in the end probably your face will come to associate them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how you were a good baker.
Bad Elves lumps of flour, sugar and fat is likely to force people to pretend to be asleep when thou shalt updating. bathroom shabby to them.
Stealing food - a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, the appropriation of someone else's chicken - the theft, but is it theft - take a bit of milk for tea?
Inquire after our milk owner.
It is likely he will not bother you, even if the inside is seething with rage.
If someone is stealing your stuff, it is annoying, and I sympathize - but you try to take this older than my neighbor, who'd poured in their milk liquid for washing dishes, to take revenge against those who took it without asking.
She is now in prison.
You should not make a noise that will impede people to sleep or study.
Not only in order to be a decent person, but because you are the same people saying about glass houses.
A girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to subtract the sound of drum and bass, as it was 3 in the morning, and she was on the morning of the exam.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally stopped at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours and then their music and locked the door behind him, having gone on a three-hour exam.
Whether it was not romantic, if your future spouse lived in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, it would not be enormously to the elbows, awkwardly, if you took a neighbor for his future wife, engrossed them, had broken relationships and would have to see him every day, and perhaps watch as he shared his side of all of your friends?
Of course, the heart is not - but if the hot neighbour is absolutely definitely not your future spouse, try slightly cooled its ardor.
The thrilling moment when you realise that someone left the keys inside the locked room, the line between drawing and anti-bullying thinner than it seems.
A good draw is fun, but it turns into its opposite in seconds.
A valuable and interesting lesson on security by hiding something - but never Mr. Big tail on some room toothpaste and shampoo.
Someone else's door and lock the keys in a glass of water, which you then [in the freezer - but not other things glue to the ceiling more than two times.

Washington responded to the Russian military activity by phone call.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support Moscow provides to President Assad, only leads to aggravation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House so far is not going to talk about it with Russian counterpart, wrote PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry telephoned Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
PJ Media reported about it.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that further support of President Assad from Russia creates the risk of intensification and prolongation of the conflict, as well as a negative impact on our shared goal of combating extremism," if we don't continue to concentrate on seeking ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through the immediate transfer of power, "the U.S. State Department officials said.
They also noted that Kerry once again underlined the U.S. commitment to the fight against the "Islamic State" as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be a member.
Moreover, the United States "will welcome the constructive role of Russia in trying to counter the" Islamic State. "
Last Friday, White House officials said they do not know exactly what actions are taking Russian troops in Syria, however, Washington is going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, White House spokesman Josh Ernest said that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet occurred: "When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he would lift up and tries to make this call."
Barack Obama himself believes Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime's "losing bet."
I remember our conversation with Mr Putin for four or five years ago, when I told him that this is a mistake that further support Assad only worsen the situation.
"But he has not listened to my warnings - and as a result, the situation worsened," said the US President.
Imported yachts are freed from customs duties.
The Ministry intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other craft for recreation and sport from customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes in the list of preferential goods for temporary exclusion were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the government of the Russian Federation.
This "Izvestiya reported Elena Assistant Minister for Economic development.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev following a trip to Crimea commissioned a number of departments - the Ministry of Economic development, the Russian culture Ministry, Foreign Ministry, EMERCOM, FSB, TCF, is to prepare proposals to create favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storing, servicing and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - about €200 million annually into the coffers of European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic development of Russia prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On Amendments to the List of goods, temporarily imported with full exemption from customs duties and taxes, which provide full conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes on imported yachts and other floating funds for recreation and sport.
According to the Ministry, it certainly will facilitate the creation of favourable conditions for the development of sailing in coastal areas of the country, "said.
This question was submitted to the subcommittee on, regulation, protective measures in foreign trade, a Government commission on Economic development and integration, the meeting which took place in September, and the discussion was also approved by the departments.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic development, the proposed measure on full conditional release at import is inherently the benefit.
So after the approval of the minutes of a meeting of the Subcommittee in the government of the Russian Federation Ministry of Economic development will make a proposal in the Eurasian Economic Commission to discuss with member States, explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempted from paying customs duties and taxes, includes goods needed to assist foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for use in the field of science, culture, cinema, sport and tourism, to provide international aid and others among them - service equipment (personal computers, typewriters, measuring devices, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water-skiing, racing cars, motorcycles, sporting flying machines, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and items for religious ceremonies.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation to "Izvestiya" told that prepared a binding resolution on sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Evpatoria and Feodosia, which provide for a simplified procedure for the clearance of call and the release of maritime law, the sport of sailing and pleasure boats in the sea port.
Transport given instructions hemlsmen sea ports in Crimea to ensure the application of the simplified procedure for maritime setting, the sport of sailing and pleasure boats in the sea port and the release of these vessels from the sea port.
Also the Russian government Ministry prepared projects orders approving the boundaries of water sea ports in Crimea.
In respect of Yalta and Feodosia directives already adopted, the rest are pending, the press office.
According to the Ministry of Transport, grading and certification, in respect of the vessels used for non-commercial purposes, should implement the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia the yachting industry is very difficult precisely because of poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there is a constantly growing industry, which involved a large number of people.
In Russia practically all stand still.
Our coast, the only piece where you can operate year-round yachts, is the Black Sea near Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that this area is extremely strict rules of border service: in order to get a walk on a yacht, you need to make a lot of permits.
Besides, even inside Russia yacht no pit-stop.
For two days she can go with their fuel, and then face the problem of where to take it, "says sales director Denis Novikov.
As for places to store yachts, in Moscow and St Petersburg now have special hangars for yachts of up to 30 meters also commandeered yacht deposited in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov said that buyers of yachts - rich people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts dropped.
The World Bank gave Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank has approved a new debt project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million on the development of the financial sector.
The press service of the international organization.
"New funding supports a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," reads the message.
World Bank country Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Fan said that reform of the banking sector will help to revive lending in the real economy and will stimulate recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank are experiencing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems Fan calls on the Ukrainian government to accelerate reforms.
Previously, the Polish government approved a loan of €100 million in Ukraine, reports RIA Novosti.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
The Public Council at the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) to protect the rights of prisoners in October 2015, among other issues, will discuss the possibility of creating separate blocks in the colonies for transgenders, and transvestites.
About this "Izvestiya" told a member of the Board of Vladislav Mushroom.
In his opinion, depending on the total number of prisoners in Russia, undecided with Paul, in domestic prisons perhaps envisage a separate camera, blocks or even (if such criminals will be many) in the future to create a special colony for transgender people.
However, Vladislav Mushroom emphasizes that determine on the departure of punishment of citizens in such isolated places is possible only after the convicted will be appropriate medical examination, which prove that the offender is indeed a man, this itself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grebe is confident that the marginalization of transgender people from the other inmates will ensure the safety of serving sentences.
He said the proposed practice successfully operates abroad: in the detention centre (where the defendants are before the court decision) provides separate cameras for transgender people, and in prisons - special units.
Today it is the only way when dealing with such criminals.
Clearly they need to isolate, because the presence of transvestites and transgender people in ordinary cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for Federal employees.
Humiliations by cellmates are guaranteed, says Vladislav Mushroom.
Depending on how large the city, how many criminals with undetermined sex, need and rely on where to distribute them.
SIZO separate definitely not needed - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible, if there will be a lot of transgender people.
As explained by Mushroom, in the block can contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps will be established in Russia alone, then act on the departure of punishment inmates transsexuals will be there from all regions.
Citizens are contained in the detention centre at the place of the crime, so revenues transvestite or transgender people from other subjects during the investigation and trial are unreal, but to impose such practices for already convicted in a separate colony - yes, says Mushroom.
Recall, on the eve of the law enforcement officers could not decide what remand - male or female - to determine a detainee for drug possession 24-летнего Dmitry Transsexual (known under the name of Alina Davis) because of what the man with a girlish appearance was not arrested.
He was released under his home.
The news was widely discussed on social networks and media, as the mechanism of the contents of transgender people in prison and there are no colonies in Russia indeed.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alexeyev supported the idea of creating special places for a sentence, noting that abroad may also define people in the colonies - male or female - according to their own desires.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it is a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as is the question of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals, "says Alexeev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be done in the name of this and for homosexuals, the more that their prisons more than transgender people.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubts that Russia turns out to be a lot of citizens willing to impersonate in order to get different from ordinary colony.
Of course, you can enter a medical examination before we put people in prison for transgender people, but it is not always clear.
In the US, for example, one of the prisoners, Chelsea looked like a man, already in jail, said that she wants to change the floor, Alexeyev said.
A person can feel anything.
But while individual places to serve a sentence for transgender people, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the safety of such people and understand their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze said that the introduction of a new distribution system in the colony could severely delay the beginning of convicts serving their punishment.
The Commission is created - it is a question of sexology, psychiatrists spend lengthy surveillance, it is not one test, on the basis of which makes high-precision conclusion.
The current possibility of psychiatry is allowed.
Therefore, before you change your sex potential patients are always such expertise - they accurately show whether sex change surgery with a necessary measure, "said Lordkipanidze.
However, it is hard for me to imagine how this system to introduce to the convicts, because on average this survey goes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that the whole idea of creating separate blocks for transgender supported, also doubts that in the current economic conditions will be expedient to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examination - transgender people in Russia units.
It is difficult to calculate, there is no official statistics, but if you consider that homosexuals in Russia around 5%, then we can say that transgender people even less, and those who have such a deviation and even commit crimes, even a small amount, "said Lordkipanidze.
Now, at the request of the colony before the administration of homosexuals, transgender and so can obtain separate detention conditions.
Mikhail Antipov won junior World Chess Championship.
The World Chess Championship in Khanty-mansiysk Junior up to 20 years.
The ending of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was decided only in the last round, and they became Russian Mikhail Antipov, managed to catch the Pole still dudu, who seemingly confidently walked to the title.
The girls had Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buxa Tiger Reserve celebrated victory.
The World Chess Championship, since the beginning of September in Khanty-mansiysk, already by the middle of the tournament distance seemed to have lost almost all the intrigue, as the Polish representative Duda that issued a series of four victories (competitions are held in the Swiss system in 13 tours), confidently captured the leadership.
Given that Duda was the championship, yes, and generally considered one of the most promising young players, the likelihood that he will lose the gap produced, seemed quite insignificant.
And even when Duda is playing worse momentum and allowed Russian Mikhail Cut the gap to just 0.5 points, he remained the obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, to catch up with the leader, was sure to win in the 13th round.
But even this does not help, win Duda his party.
Plus this is the obligation of victory, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, then had to wait when his party will complete Duda, fatal Benjamin sideways.
Fortunately for the Polish chess player arranged the confrontation with a Dutchman in a tie.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 of 13 possible, but have had the best additional indicators.
But because it is the leadership of the Khanty-mansi Autonomous Okrug, whose governor Natalya Komarova, traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, handed the top prize.
But in competitions girls intriguing tailpieces never happened.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Vaduz (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, which she did with success.
Thus, the Russian victory by Alina not allowed her to catch up.
Russian athlete remained second in the champion slippage of 0.5 points.

- Comfortable rate for 10-13%.
Experts estimate that the market for lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-april of this year fell by 40%.
What you estimate the situation today?
After the panic end of 2014 and early 2015, SME lending volumes have declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp rise in interest rates.
Lending under 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
If the bank previously could lay in increased bet all his possible problems in the future, from overdues before, now it is impossible to do: rates and sky-high.
The current level of business rates for Smes is.
For a large part of the investment projects the current level is unacceptable from the point of view of their payback.
The level of rates 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and shape them attractive yields.
How you estimate met demand for loans to entrepreneurs?
After the Central Bank lowering the interest rate, the situation has improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients began to apply for loans much less frequently.
First of all, business does not understand its development prospects and future earnings.
Today, businesses have one way out: you need to learn to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
We need to more closely monitor the current results to control cash flows.
At the same time, the availability of financial resources is to use new technologies to modernize the equipment, reduce the cost of production and energy supplies.
All of this ultimately allows the company to make products more competitive and maintain business even in unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends of SME lending market will be strengthened and will influence its development until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast to reduce average rates will largely depend on Central Bank policy, and now the regulator shows the sequence in the issue of lowering key interest rates.
But the radical drop in the prices of credit for Smes.
In the current situation, the problem, first and foremost, is inflation, which makes the necessary increased interest rate for receiving real income.
Moreover, the cost of money in Russia to remain high even when Central Bank rates.
If we talk about the level of delay, the traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, limited as opportunities to replenish funds and economic behavior correction options will certainly represent a greater risk for lenders.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the proportion of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy of the country.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
It is the word of the Mazda Japanese kanji.
Beautiful, tersely and simultaneously is quite difficult for those accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
And the new CX-5 crossover, as well as any other brand model: without attractive on the outside, technically perfect inside.
The Japanese already simply by virtue of their "products" can bring the attachment to the Land of the Rising sun to the state of complete ecstasy.

Kiev tore atomic uniyu.
Kiev officially has made the refusal of Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnitsky NPP.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday with the second attempt still voted for the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
An agreement on the extension of the third and fourth blocks were signed back in 2010-2012, but the project failed to proceed.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law in 2010-2012 negotiated an agreement with Russia on the construction of the third and fourth block on Khmelnitskiy NPP.
The bill introduced by the government of the country managed to spend only the second vote, the first time he supported 210 deputies at the required minimum of 226, but then opted for the project at 234 members of parliament.
When the USSR enunciated Khmelnitskiy Nuclear Power Plant on the original project was supposed to have four units 1 GW with VVER reactors, but managed to build only two.
Talks with Moscow about expansion led by 2010 to conclude an intergovernmental agreement, in 2011-2012, Rada adopted the relevant laws.
Because Ukraine had no money in the budget, it was assumed that build blocks will be on loan to the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the ensuing cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to expand relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing a refusal to cooperate on Khmelnitskiy NPP project and construction of nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where the relationship survived, remained in Russia fuel purchases for the existing Ukrainian NPP (provided about half of the electricity generation in the country), as the Ukrainian NAEK "Energoatom" to replace Russian supplies.
From completing plans Khmelnitskiy NPP with another contractor in Ukraine until finally refused: still in 2014 in Kiev stated negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.

With the approval of the protocol on the results of the election, Communist Party officials announced multiple violations.
A member of the consultative capacity from Communist Party Leonid Krasnokutskiy suggested not to recognize the results of the voting on four districts No21-24, reminding that at the behest of the head of the district administration was closed the entrance to the administration building, where the four county commission.
Inside long could not pass neither the Mps nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers, and the resonant scandal by storm doors was shown on TV.

However, already more than 124 complaints on different occasions, according to Alexander Makeeva, has not found any violations with unaccounted for ballots.
Members of the commission did not support the proposal and their colleagues from "Fair Russia"; Mary through exit with regional legislation amended to clearly establish the time of envelopes with early voting ballots, which then fall into the ballot box.

Fedex revenues is mixed, lowering forecasts for 2016
Fedex results of disappointing results last quarter, and service delivery giant reduced forecast annual profits because of falling demand for freight services and cost growth in its ground transportation unit.
The company also said it plans to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, Fedex reported that engage the 50,000 temporary employees for the holidays.
Its shares fell 2.5 percent on a preliminary bid for approximately 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
Fedex Corp. said it expects to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10,84 according to a survey.
The forecast decline observed in spite of the rise in rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which takes effect on January 4, and an increase in fees for the ground transportation of heavy or larger cargoes, which begins in November.
The company said it still expects revenue growth compared to last year due to a reduction in costs, increase in gross revenue and growth of online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "worked steadily, taking into account the weak, compared with the forecast, economic conditions, especially in the production and world trade."
Labor hiring plans in the holidays were announced the day after competitor, UPS, that they plan to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same number as were on the job last year.
For the quarter ended August 31, Fedex earned $692 million, 6 percent more than the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2: 42, close to the average forecast of $2.44 per share by Zacks Investment Research Survey 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed zacks expect $12.23 billion.
Fedex has suffered in recent years from the downturn in the sector of urgent international transportation, which led to a lack of growth in gross revenue in its division.
However, the boom in online shopping has dramatically improved results in Fedex Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from ground shipping rose 29 percent, but operating earnings remained broadly unchanged because of elevated costs of major departures and self-insurance.
The division has received a higher income due to higher base rates, whereas in the cargo sector, income fell because of higher labor costs.
In a preliminary bid for about an hour before the opening of the exchange shares of Fedex fell $3,85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, having dropped 11 percent for the year and 17 per cent below the record from June 11.
On the most anticipated for several years, meeting the heads of the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week for 27-футовым table of Honduran mahogany, deciding whether it is time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of the richly decorated rooms for meetings height two floors above them will wall the image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The central Bank has received a double assignment from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and maintain stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the heads of the Federal system acknowledged that there is a third order: financial stability.
And this is the third order may prove to be an unknown factor in the almost unprecedented decision that will declare on Thursday about whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the stimulus, which is almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show strong growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in world financial markets may hold the already cautious leaders of the Federal system from adding volatility by raising the base federal funds rate - even just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important issue," said Lindsey M., chief economist at brokerage company & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus about what to do in the Federal Reserve system, which, in itself, provokes financial market fluctuations.
Roughly half of economists recently polled by Bloomberg had forecast a rise in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to refrain from it, while a key indicator shows only about 30-процентную likelihood of rapid recovery.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the Fed raises rates, provided that those who make decisions, will cushion the blow to the promise that the next increase will not soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to 16 599.85.
The rise was driven by expectations that the faces that define the strategy of the Federal System will leave rates this week, "said John, Chief economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research group.
"It will be a surprise if the Fed raise rates at this time," he said.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve system will, they have far to go in asserting its strategy to keep financial markets in their hands, that they do not. "
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets, as it should remove uncertainty about how the Fed will act.
Just a month ago the Federal system seems to have tended to raise the rate by 0.25 percent this month, making the first little tiny step in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that it expects to raise rates this year, despite complaints by liberals that need more economic progress.
Although the emergence of new jobs in August slowed, labor market growth was stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost on a level that considered full employment in the Federal system.
Wage growth shows signs of accelerating.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank target annual rate of 2%, the leadership of the Federal System announced that a key reason was the temporary effect of a sharp fall in oil prices.
"The economy can cope with higher rates, and needs them, taking into account the reduction in the labour market," said Ian, Chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devaluing its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell as much as 16% relative to a record high in May, as investors feared that a slowing Chinese economy could drag on global growth.
The market partly restored its position this month, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve System market resentment additionally complicates the difficult calculations of the term to raise interest rates.
"In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks they would have started tightening the screws at this meeting," said Stephen D., senior researcher at the UCLA Center for Real Estate and a former member of the Federal Reserve system.
Now, he predicted, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
"There is a big uncertainty in what might be the consequences for the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data after recent events in China," said.
The health of the global economy is not the main concern of the Federal System, and technically it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.
But essentially the Fed has become the global financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
One only hint from the then chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "stifle" its monetary expansion, sparked turmoil on markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies increasingly intertwine with each other, one would expect that the leaders of the Federal Reserve system will not only monitor the development of events everywhere, but to consult with representatives of the other Central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is an art rather than a science, "said Zachary, Head of Inc. - a company that is engaged in global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Laquer, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said this month that "there have been cases in the history of the Federal Reserve system over-reacting to the movement of the financial market, which does not seem to be related to economic fundamentals."
Laquer, an influential voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who pressed for raising rates, as an example of led solutions acquires.
The financial crisis in Asia has led to a Federal system has reduced its base rate at 0.75 percent over three sessions, despite limited identifiable implications for growth in the United States, "said Laquer.
A year later, the heads of the Federal System abolished these cuts.
The Federal Reserve system should be put in the first place only care about stability in times of great crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008, "said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee for Setting interest rates at the Bank of England.
The latest panic is not close to that level, he said.
"You would certainly not want to be in a situation where you fear growth rates due to the fact that markets are experiencing shock," said Posen, President of the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International economics.
The law on the Federal Reserve still has a dual mandate and mentions financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be ahead of events.

As Interfax reports, such opinion he told reporters in Mongolia as part of the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a proponent of theories, but it begs a question: not whether Europe is the ultimate goal of those with such manic perseverance in recent years has destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?" he asked himself a question.
"Because surely someone speculated and knew that the streams of refugees, the poor and disadvantaged people who are fleeing death, released in good EU countries," he added.

Government troops and rebels loyal to them confront violent groups composed mostly of Islamists.
Later to the opponents of the Syrian government joined the banned terrorist group "Islamic state" in Russia.
The US supports the rebels, and who oppose Assad, and IG.
The official Damascus considers such rebels as terrorists.
Syria's President called the reason for the unpleasantness of the West to Russia.
The West claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran, is actually that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, the Channel "Russia 24", NTV, "Russia today," TASS, "Interfax" and "Russian newspaper."
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign states.
In these countries he wanted to remove one person and put in his place another who will act in the interests of Western countries, but not in the interests of his Motherland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to a sharp reversal of the Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
He said that for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "has turned from friend to enemy to the West, tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power through undemocratic, despite the fact that he was elected in a democratic election, recognized in the West."
Putin urged the international community to join forces with Assad to fight against the "Islamic State."
Commenting on the persistent Western claims that Assad must go by himself, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if goes - at the request of the people, not the decision of the United States, the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If people want to he remained president remains, but otherwise he should resign immediately," he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded that cooperation with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism together with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking about military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noticed that this country supports the Syrian government, in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He refuted allegations that Iranian military units are sent to Syria.
Tehran has supplied us military equipment.
"Naturally there is exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange was always," he explained.
As for the other states, we are ready to cooperate with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We do not see in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and coalition U.s.-led," Asad said.
The death toll exceeded 230 thousand people, the number of refugees is 11.5 million.
Part of the territory seized by the terrorist group "Islamic state" banned in Russia.

The Battle for one of the regional titles for the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category to 57.15 kg last Friday ended with the victory of Magali knockout in the 12th round.
Brown also came to the hospital with a traumatic brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life-support apparatus.
On the professional ring Brown won 22 victories, has suffered only two defeats and one fight ended in a draw.
He had two children.
This is the second case of a lethal outcome among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March from injuries received in the ring, a 23-year-old student Braydon Smith died.
Now the AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, but better, from their point of view, to ban it altogether.
I understand that this happens unintentionally, "said Stephen, Vice President of the organization.
But as there is now a boxing, will always happen in such situations when an athlete gets a brain hemorrhage or trauma that leads to death or severe damage.

Victory for a couple of days.
Athletics World Champion Sergej.
This season can be called a triumph for Sergei 24-летнего from Barnaul.
He succeeded on their own at a distance of 110 metres hurdles to win the European team Championship, set several records, and the main thing is to become a world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
Moreover, recently, the athlete won the final stage of the Diamond League, finishing in third place overall.
"New News" was asked to share their impressions of the past season.
Sergei, you have not yet finished for the season?
Yes, I am going to speak at the World military games, which will take place October in Korea, and then I will think about the rest.
True, I will now prepare at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still quite another condition.
Everything is easier than the world each week.
You once said that the fall is a favorite time of the year for you.
The end of August, beginning of September is a great time.
Passions after the main season start, the burden of responsibility is no longer mindlessly.
They can compete in fun, "".
Plus you know that holiday very soon...
And there is fatigue?
Still season special, lots of positive emotions...
Fatigue at the end of the season always accumulates.
And no matter what I was doing anymore - won or lost.
Every competition is stress.
Frequent flights, transfers, all this does not pass for the organism.
Tired physically and emotionally.
But now the emotions I have, of course, on the rise.
Yes - I was just happy there!
By the time the World championship in Beijing, return often?
It happens.
Yes, and you, journalists don't give me to forget about it.
But in general I believe that any athlete who lives with old victories, foot over their successful races again and again.
Victory for a couple of days - and we need to move on.
Preparation for this wonderful season strongly differed from the usual?
I cannot say that it was something special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed a winter break in the season.
Trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the training camp, then home again.
All as usual.
But the coach got the goal: to try to reach a new level, which I was not yet.
Almost all of the winter spent to lay the base.
The company covered the heap, made training exercises, which included and cravings, and, and we are back.
Then began preparing for the barrier, many engaged in the technique.
How are rivals, monitored?
I always try to do it, in the Internet age with no problems.
Looked a winter European Championship, and there, the whole pedestal in barrier sprint took the French!
Another thought: we must do something, dilute this company.
With every start this season you stings and stings in the results.
This gave confidence?
I have all the recent seasons are on roughly the same scheme.
There is no such that I run first 14,20 and then 13.50.
Always its shape gradually.
The main thing is that he wanted to do - run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was aimed primarily at this result.
But the paradox is that kind of feeling that is ready for feats and competitions to show his readiness is not always.
As it was, for example, at the Olympics in London?
I, frankly, the semi-final race (failed to qualify for the finals. - "No") tried to forget immediately.
It was very good, really could run out of 13 seconds.
Yes even if repeated his best result at the moment would be the bronze medal of the Games.
But no luck.
My first World Cup, remember?
But how?
It was in Daegu.
Then I really wanted to climb in the final, there was such a long-term goal.
And with the right, in the preliminary qualifiers.
And then realized that tear and rush headlong - so do not rouse.
Two years later at the World Championships in Moscow has already reached the final with the best time.
Well remember their feelings before deciding: very much like then win gold!
How do you manage, developing a decent speed, and still not lose his head, not shut down?
And this is the most difficult.
We need to be very careful, focused on technology, not to knock down barriers.
Noticed that when you set yourself up on the result, but the process is so much easier.
But the most buzz, when you have a feeling that it and all like itself!
Honestly, it is worth it.
Many of our athletes from the province after the first serious successes are keen to move closer to the capital.
Never had such thoughts?
The house is still better.
Yes, and no idea where I am without his coach whom I need?
Maybe it would be good to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
C you are together for a long time?
With 12 years since 1902 came to light.
More precisely, I first trained his wife, who worked with children, and then she gave me.
I started with sprint, then long jumping, triple.
Childish all-around was when hurl the ball, long jump...
In 14 tasted hurdling, and I liked it.
From the first race was run by the second adult discharge.
Remained.
There was never a fear of hurdles?
Somehow managed to agree with them immediately.
But the technique has always had to work very much.
Won over one overclocking how many suffered!
But no escaping from this routine.
The technique should be rounding out constantly - so I could wake up in the night, I immediately got up and ran through the barriers.
Anyone who saw your race in Beijing, argued that it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked myself.
I usually don't when I go through their races, and it could not keep.
But we need to continue to work on efficiency - there is no limit to perfection.
Not afraid now that victory a year before the Olympic Games, will fall on the shoulders of a heavy load?
As they say in such cases, will try to justify the expectations.
Once chosen this road, then should go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you don't, no additional cargo should not feel.
And I absolutely agree with him in this.
Otar
Well, I am not so naive that I led in amazement the reaction to the interview, what happened in Ukraine.
People are resentful, I understand their bread will not feed - dai, an enemy.
And although I didn't flag, and the same, exactly the same, a million times here and nobody directly called - me more angry.
All my numbing, a second has vanished somewhere.
Pressure, which I'm me, is so strong that even I, held the lad, think people obelis.
If he walked, walked and you were attacked by a mob and well rods.
But you should know me, I am not a new eagle, me with his fist, I'm from howitzers, star I, guys, be afraid.
No support is another matter.
I have and so had no illusions, but now...
Self-sufficiency was always the best in me, so what.
And give passports such as Fred or Monson, can only morons.
Better for me, the best journalist to work.
A week ago in Kiev Otar in sharp form characterized the Crimean events:
What did with the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is called the annexation.
I believe that the reference to how tipsy Khrushchev tried to sign something, in no event does not fit into the overall picture of human dormitories.
It as come to the neighbor and take away his house...
The war from the Kremlin has gone, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100 percent sure that, as in the summer of 2008, she started with a call for some bastard from the Kremlin.
I have the assumptions of who it could be...
There is not much to live.
I do not understand, he is the greatest artist, why does he need to lick the hands of Putin.
Did he lose the apartment?
Well, he demolished the monument.
Of course, people have remembered him as her home.
And reconciliation now only from Vladimir Vladimirovich depends.

It is unclear why the rubber bullets, which, as we know, can be killed, but their traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, caused such a high mortality rate.
This clash was the last few weeks of violent protests in the south, the flat part of Nepal, where community representatives argued that new provinces formed on a new constitution, would reduce their political influence.

Sayansk plant plans to create 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk Region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as the center of the chemical industry, has a well-developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.

Earlier paper applications could walk for months.
Measures were developed to increase the revenue base and cost optimization.
In November last year in the field meeting of government, where issues were discussed the socio-economic development of the territory.
The city was not B3 (OCI) nor a single object.
Without this Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of the OCI road, kindergarten, the north is becoming a collector and discovery.
Now roadworks on two sites are already underway.
As in the city is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation about the construction of kindergartens?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born.
There was no such positive demographics in the city for the past 27 years.
So the question of the availability of places in kindergartens today is one of the most pressing.
From September 1, closed on the overhaul of the kindergarten # 10, calculated to 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million rubles.
Such funds, the city still has not received.
Last year, after the repair opened kindergarten No 23, which is now visited by 200 children.
The repair was made on condition of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its price was more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and regional governments were found to aid funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the program has helped "folk" initiative.
There are plans to begin construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
Since its introduction, we plan to eliminate the ranking of children between the ages of one and a half to three years.
Queues for children from three to seven years, we have not.
Investors are showing interest in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city must do, first and foremost, the enterprise, it is their need to provide jobs.
Already in operation in October surrenders 60-квартирный home for orphans in Leningrad.
As for construction, I would add that Sayansk is one of four cities in the Angara region who entered the building housing program.
All necessary documentation ready.

Google launches a campaign of doubling of donations to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (campaign) announced the beginning of the doubling of donations intended for collecting $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping European countries refugees who flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used an individual approach, announcing a campaign to collect donations on his blog.
Instead of a statement made by one of the managers, employee of Google Rita Masood, from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, described his personal experience.
"We were getting on dubious trains and buses experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, many people like my family desperately need help.
Donations will be transferred to four non-profit organizations by refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, the organization Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that it would double its first $5.5 million in donations, while the amount of page google.com / refugeerelief reaches 11 million dollars.
Europe is opposed to end refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which this year moved more than 4 million people.
Many are also fleeing from covered wars in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

Obesity surgery can help diabetics with obesity
Favorable effect after obesity surgery in people with obesity, type 2 diabetes sufferers can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
Now, however, it is still too early to assert that diabetics with slight obesity live longer after surgery for obesity than those who receive treatment.
"Mortality statistics is not immediately," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity Surgery, who wrote about a new study in the column of the editor of JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the sense of hunger and restrict the ability to metabolize food.
For several years, bariatric surgery has proved its effectiveness for treating type 2 diabetes, but the basic studies were conducted among people with obesity, having a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal at value from 18.5 to 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or above suggests that humans have overweight and people with a BMI above 30 are considered people with obesity.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan General Hospital used data collected from 2007 to compare the two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sock, with medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people with low obesity.
The average BMI of those who underwent surgery, dropped from 31 to 24.5 at the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, the BMI of those who received treatment for diabetes, remains approximately at the level of 29.
Among those who underwent the operation completely cured of diabetes by 36%, and partly - 28%.
In the group who had received medical treatment, for comparison, the complete cure of diabetes was only 1%, and partial - only about 2%.
Additionally, rates of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "in general were better in the surgical group," the authors say.
The researchers also monitored the а1с hemoglobin levels in the blood that reflect the blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c test better hold below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c test levels decreased from about 9% to around 6%.
In a therapeutic group, however, he remained stable at around 8%.
But the best indicators of control at good levels of hemoglobin A1c test not reduced mortality rates for five years, according to the leader of the Research, Dr. Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, in comparison with the group, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin А1с (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was closer to full remission of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, according to the results of the study confirm there are people with overweight in Sweden that surgical treatment really leads to increased life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the College of Medicine in Phoenix, the University of Arizona.
According to Swedish studies for people with obesity who have chosen intervention, the likelihood of dying for 15 years was about 29% lower compared to the group that used more traditional methods.
Although the new study showed no increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it is encouraging people with a BMI below 35 interested in such a procedure.
"Here is a very important report, because it stated that such surgery safely in the group with low BMI, where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors must begin to seriously treat weight as soon as a patient's BMI falls into the range between 27 and 30.
"I think we are waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that as soon as they accumulate genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, to pay it back is very difficult.
In Mytishchi robbers were from home of fur and 9 million rubles.
In Mytishchi robbers attacked residents of Moscow at home and they have stolen 9 million rubles and three female fur.
It informs "Interfax" with reference to the press-service of the Russian Interior Ministry.
The incident happened on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown entered the house through an open front door, located on Gorky Street, tied a 20-year mistress son home and threatening both with a knife, kidnapped 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of the damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, opened a criminal case under Article "Robbery."
The fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to display the tourists who come to see the World Cup 2018.
The rest of the hotel is not yet in a hurry to get the appropriate permission.
Experts say this is a very worrying sign.
In the run-up to the world championship, the authorities urgently need to invent ways to resettle all guests of the city.
"Interlocutors" believe that the tournament will grow because of the cost of renting a removable flats by 10-30%, and after the championship for removable housing will have to overpay.
The World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the condition of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for primacy, each hotel St. Petersburg should undergo the procedure of classification and prove that corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
Now it is clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so wary of inspections that are often not even deported documents to requests from the Federal Antimonopoly Service in St Petersburg.
Vadim Vladimirov told the head of the Office, the agency looked at 138 hotels and now plans to open 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond.
There are signs that the leadership of three dozen companies deluded citizens, placing any number of stars in advertising, said Vladimirov.
The problem is that now literally every room, no one should lose a year before 2018.
Officials suspect that fans during a football championship will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city, tourists can count on 30.5 thousand numbers.
According to Smolny, 17 5-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotel, 100 - two- and three-star, 550.
According to the first Deputy Aleksandria Tourism development Committee, at the moment, the classification underwent only 23 hotels - so many inspections conducted accredited company in St. Petersburg.
But whether some dodgy hotel regional enterprises have a similar procedure, by an amazing coincidence is unknown.
That is the past classification can be more, but nobody knows about it.
"The last six months, hotels are not very eager to undergo classification," admitted the director of the Northwest branch of the Russian Union of Tourism Ekaterina.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn more money and don't want to do other things.
Another reason is that budgets in which expenditures were laid not on inspections, the procedure can cost the hotel depending on status from 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
But lately the leaders of hotels intensified and began to apply for classification, assured.
Hotels need to catch up to July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only have to pay a fine, but would not get the right to work at the World Cup.
Already it is known that depending on the rating will be developed a fixed fee per room in the hotel at the time of the tournament.
The formula by which the cost will be calculated, will announce next year.
This is done to prevent price hikes on 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to have a conscience and avoid increasing two to three times, but also hotels need to give money.
"I think the growth will be up to 50 percent," said Gennady Russian hotel Association President.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that the fixation of price corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how this fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better to jump a twinge," he said.
It is unclear what will happen to popular cheap.
The deputies of the State Duma introduced the bill, according to which the hostels should be banned in homes.
Very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not touch the St Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved," Anas said.
However, she said, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be prepared to strengthen the Housing Code.
If the State Duma finally approves the bill, then in St. Petersburg will close approximately 80% of hostels, but at the moment there are 1,500 rooms in them.
According to the President of the Federation of restaurateurs and hoteliers North-west of Leonid, in St. Petersburg, lacks the two- and three-star hotels which are football fans, but there is a skew toward hotels with four and five stars.
This state of affairs is analogous to the situation when "80-тысячном 75,000 sitting on the stadium walls were dirty with marks."
This can be corrected just by mini-hotels.
Their possible ban expert believes "": "It seems to me strange that some people can live in apartments, and here the out-of-towners for some reason can't."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, I agree that it is wrong.
But if as a hotel in which guests come for a short period of time, why not?
The risk of hard to miss the World Cup, and because of its fragmented.
Literally hundreds of small hotels simply will not pass the classification, with the pit digging themselves.
By the summer of 2016 book works will be all the hotels in the city.
"Companies that could conduct this procedure not so much so they will abandon the less well-paid orders from mini-hotels and will choose those who get more money," Gennady said, adding that in some cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, indicators of traversed inspections at the moment are considerably higher than St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delays connected including the permanent tourist block in the government that is not conducive to harmonious work.
Experts say if the St. Petersburg hotels all is not enough, that is likely to have to pay attention to the regional hotels and holiday homes.
Following the example of the celebrations marking the 300th anniversary of Petersburg city can mobilize the river fleet, the guests of the tournament will be able to stay in the cabins.
Moreover, many fans products will come on vans in which to spend the night.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels, so then they were unoccupied," Gennady - sure.
Also popular during the football championship will use removable housing.
Most likely the city will create a reserve of removable apartments.
Rental rates will rise 10-30%.
"From the obvious - the first leaves housing near the stadium," said an expert on rental real estate research and Development Agency, Larissa Braguin.
Moreover, the rental price may not return to previous levels after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will facilitate and build new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she said.
One should not forget about the human qualities of citizens.
For example, Leonid is confident that St. Petersburg was always a hospitable city in which people not simply suggest a road, but can still spend.
There are also complications.
My dad, in 1970 in the yard met a family from Murmansk - father, mother and two children.
They turned out to be no night: hotels was difficult, difficult to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them into our communal apartment to sleep," recalled the interlocutor.
However, he added that now such traits in people of the city is not left to call home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But maybe in 2018 after unsuccessful decisions of the Duma, mistakes hoteliers and governments will have to recall?
Zhirinovsky remained "wtf" area.
Looked at with admiration today in the State Duma Zhirinovsky.
He did such things, when our generation only studied trade papers, and still is in great shape.
The subject of the speech seems the LDPR - "protest against the election results in the Amur Region.
Protocols not shakes - for nothing; other protocols, except signed, the LDPR have, apparently, no.
Here he raises the runner-up applicant Ivan Abramova and shouting something like: "Here is the winner of the election!"
And then with what is coming on, and then, after some skirmishes with the presiding, diverts faction Hall, literally screaming at you all with your fronts "swindlers and thieves."
The press, of course, gives the emphasis not on Abramova and scandal and demarche faction as a consequence of this scandal and insults.
Really beautifully and elegantly wtf remained together with the area.
For the whole country, it is another trick of Zhirinovsky in the style of "Such scum!" rather than protest political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction formally, and elections, according to the website of the party and Ivan Abramova, not recognized, but the leader with the themes apparently.
Provides dead on the Amur River itself to bury their dead, and informed himself against United Russia as a whole and not Rodnina surrenders.
Elegant solution to and not to lose face, and in the present, not ostentatious scandal not to go.
Another thing that is now in a strange position and Abramov himself.
Apart form from superiors he would have nothing, no alternative protocols on the hands.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other for a narrow circle that he became a formal reason for insults respected champion, and that is even steeper, and attacks against the EP.
And here he is, of course, we need to think very seriously about what to do.
Because of the main beneficiary of the election, the politics of the region number 2 and number 1 candidate on the only regional single-mandate district he could turn into a pariah who successfully his own party leadership and for the party leadership and someone else's.
That certainly would not - Zhirinovsky, he should come up and respectfully for him to watch.
Even before him to grow and grow.
There is news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next.
That is bath fell at all with that.
The only subject under a Abramova.
Really nice.
"It is impossible to come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot take all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called on to stop violence in countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama's Compassion Centre in Oxford, dedicated to research ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity must be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although it is admired, the reaction of Western countries to the crisis of refugees is not suited to the situation.
"It's all come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama spoke highly about the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
"Concern about thousands of refugees - fine, but at the same time, you should think about long-term decisions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, in these Muslim countries," he said.
In the end, we should think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force will never solve these problems, "he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George W. Bush after the terrorist attacks of 9 / 11, saying that the harsh reaction of the United States launched a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9 / 11 I expressed his condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem through may.
I know that his intentions were good, but he has used force, and this caused unexpected consequences, "the Dalai Lama said.
Four times the growth in the number of children, remarks, alcohol-based hand, over the past 4 years
Toxicological centers in the United States reported almost 400-процентном increase since 2010, the number of children under 12 years, alcohol-based hand remarks with a high content of alcohol, according to the Georgia State out-of-state.
According to Dr Lopez, director of the Georgia State Toxicological Center, cases of children ingesting up to 12 years of liquids to disinfect hands reported toxicological centers increased from 2771 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children often come into contact with these substances, and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them goes to the emergency department," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink fluid specially, and some do it to impress their friends, or on the dispute for social networks.
Videos on Youtube shows how teenagers drink fluid as cheap to drinking.
Reportedly, teenagers mixed with liquid liquid Alcohol-containing mouthwash to get more strong drink.
Younger children may want to attract pleasant smells of fluid.
"The child does not think this could hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most liquid has (for the hands) - those that.
There is an antiseptic liquid for hands with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
The liquid for hands contains somewhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
Small children, in particular, only a few can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is a high concentration of alcohol," told Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician at the hospital of the University of Toxicological center.
You would not leave just a glass of whisky, but people keep in mind these hand disinfectants, and if the children get to them, this is a quick way to consume large amounts of alcohol.
Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed in school with an alcohol-based hand safeguard encourage aroma in the amount of approximately four, was sent for treatment in the emergency department.
The level of alcohol in the blood she was 179, twice as much as an adult, which by law is considered to be in a drunken state, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie - ambulance doctor, who treated her in the Gwinnett medical Center near Atlanta.
Words and could not walk when she was taken to the emergency department.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate pediatric clinic, in order not to miss any signs of brain injury, because alcohol girl fell and struck his head, told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," Scott told CNN, mother.
It might well prove fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use substances or disinfectant wipes, besides, in order to remove the disinfectant liquid for hands out of the reach of children.
In addition to the alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant liquid associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowed disinfectant, contained undeclared toxic ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol - a deadly agent, and not ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three of them in the north of New York City conspiracy of poison "waterfalls" teacher "through" the spread of antibacterial substances in the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher have a strong allergy to hands, and it is banned to keep them in their class.
Police believe that a failed plan was "empty talk" and addresses issues of discipline school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back benches at the entrance to the children's Library named after N.K. Krupskaya grieve... cast-iron owl.
Kids who come for books are trying to feed her sweets.
There are already several generations in this library for 95 years.
The earliest readers were in the 20s of the last century here loud readings, put performances on own poetry Mayakovsky, pursued literary quiz and corresponded with the wife of Lenin.
The correspondence continued for four years, and, as the newspaper wrote in 1939, "Junior" every day "friendship between Hope Krupskaya and friends children's Library" Barnaul City grew ever stronger.
Nadezhda Constantinovna even expelled once distant friends their baby photo.
And when asked whether Hope Constantinovna does not argue that the library gave her name, wrote that no, not objects.
Letters long collect dust in the museum, and the grandchildren and dissapear first readers have to explain whose that severe profile adorns the bas-relief on the building of the library.
During the years of perestroika often called different people were indignant: why children's library is not renamed?
Let there be a library named after some good children's writer, without political colour!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave it as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as "" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - the path of yellow brick.
"The Wizard of the Emerald city" - a favorite topic of artist Oli.
Previously, Olya was a manager in a law firm, came to work for eight, walked five, and from all other managers differed only love of drawing.
And then found the Internet ad: "Requires an illustrator for books."
A book written a little American girl, and called it "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mother with cancer."
Olya did illustrations, and thought: life could end at any moment, and no miracles in it will not be, if you do not create them himself.
She now works in the library, illustrates children's book writers all over the world and composes herself fairy tales.
It is traditionally considered that children lose interest in the book that they are increasingly living in a virtual space...
But to go read children and their parents understand the importance of reading, "said" Planet "director Tatiana Russian Library.
In recent years, we have even emerged such a moment of confidence that the children's Library is needed, and it will live - go here!
It seems to me, the interest in reading is returned.
In the library lobby hangs a large exhibition stained glass with updated.
Once a quarter to $200 new photos of readers who go to the library with the whole family: mom, Dad and children.
The library rejoice that children have increasingly come to the Pope.
If in two years the child read only Chukovsky, in more senior age he needs books harder.
But now there is a law that banned issuing books together from category 12 +.
To get such a book, the child should bring their parents - they come, then back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes something like a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library - a collection of prerevolutionary bylinas with and lead Korolenko in the annex to the magazine "Niva", "" in 1936.
After all, we are now not only a conceptual space "shrine of the book," we are now open for movement, we are trying to become a special place: no home, no work, no school, "explains Tatiana.
We can come together to read, play, draw.
We did a play area for kids - the kid comes just to play and still stretches to the book!
Some of our readers are ravaging the parents, and they run legs, do not want to leave.
Often mothers with strollers come - and we are pleased that the library they tied for first place among all the other places where we should come with children.
Tatiana says: modern kids in the same way as we once loved classic children's literature:
"Publishing is developing now, and a lot of attention is paid to authors who are the link between generations.
And if we are talking about little children, it is important that he was a hero who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to part with their heroes.
The library routinely releases booklets for parents, which tells us what is happening in modern children's literature, what books you should pay attention to and why.
Booklets are so exciting and intriguing as adults, but this is still not the library for them.
Bear books outside the reading room for adults is prohibited.
This magic privilege is only for children.
... In the back room of the library is a square Luke with ancient wooden staircase to the basement in the room.
Steps will be under your steps - this is a very old time machine.
With a book of his childhood meet, as with the old comrade: hi, it is good that we do not change with you.
Ellie still merrily sweeping the road paved yellow brick, idler Tolya Ryzhikov stealing magic matches, and never said a damn military Secrets - he had such a strong word.
Books - such as passwords, you can get them anywhere.
There is a real rarity in the store and books - for example, the prerevolutionary compilation bylinas with and.
Or novellas Korolenko in the famous appendix to the magazine "Niva".
Or "" in 1936.
Time, in their tea color.
These readers are no longer issued.
It is the shards of our future collections, I dream - we retire and will be focusing on rare children's books.
But children are on it already, so to speak, not: and paint in old books are not very bright, and themes... open the first page, and there - Lenin, Party, Komsomol.
Now it seems: why we all have this "truth?"
But it was still interesting, "says Russian Planet" Galina, head of the assessment.
"Pages" clouded over time.
Galina Vasilievna manages the collection of his entire life.
She knows what colour cap Buratino have in what academic year Harry Potter became a team captain on the Quidditch Championship, in what situations, Carlson uses suppressor for, and whom Alice Selezneva Father works.
For the work of the librarian pay little, and everyone who can live without these bookshops ranks very quickly find himself another profession.
Only the most cold-hearted: educators, teachers, ministers of the cult of the book.
You can learn more and smile - it is considered that this professional feature children's librarian.
If you smiled in the first minute, he is a professional.
I love children's books: as a librarian I like that they were to exactly and beautifully stood on the shelves, and I love to read them, says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical novel, fairy tales, fiction.
Read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, it seems to me in my childhood, everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting thing that happened to me then.
And because I loved them madly, it seemed to me that the library is a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone is sitting and reading.
I hope that books will always, in spite of the readers.
And rejoice when our former readers bring children and grandchildren...

Why I am a witness to executions in Oklahoma
Today, out-maneuvered the legal intervention at a later stage, I will watch the executed man.
If this happens, and I hope that is not all the same, I will sit on the observation gallery camera suicide in prison in Oklahoma, when Richard will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I'll cut down was in shock, I agreed.
With that day approaching, I began to fear.
So why do it?
I agreed because thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
It would have offered a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and as willing to often more than places the results of grim lottery decide who will be selected.
The number of seats for the press in Oklahoma reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotion.
I can't do it.
I will sit with very close friends of Richard, and we have own relations with him arose after several months of phone calls and one visit in 2002. two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we speak with him.
The prison administration argues that I can not be both a witness and a journalist, so I would not be allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I will have to try to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter that I'm their impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could better articulate" but still believes that I am wrong in what I'm doing.
Richard did not agree with something that I said and wrote.
He has not told me what to write, but I would not do it, even if he spoke.
I told him that he could wipe me out of your list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants the international edition of the journalist was there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that the publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to podcasts that I recorded.
I will not go into details here again.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry Wang makes him guilty of aiding a crime.
But I believe that there is a high probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence was not enough for a death sentence.
I believe that his execution was wrong.
And from that perspective I will watch as he dies.
I cannot say that I will be entirely academic.
There will be other reporters, to which you can apply for this.
From me you will know what it is to watch a man who I like, die unnecessarily.
Persecuted by police persuaded the man to get out of the Canning river
From the town managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning river and himself to stay dry.
A resident of Perth intended to evade police, but not managed, anchored in the dirty water in shallow water a few metres away from the police officer, attempting to "gently persuade him to go on the beach."
Police were called on Tuesday for illegal infiltration into a foreign territory.
When police spotted the suspect, he tried to escape from them, scurrying in Canning.
But he had gone far.
"He stood in the water and said" I will not go, let's me, "said senior sergeant.
Not very much like wetting the form, so he used a safer reception - "negotiations with a good cop."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," says the senior sergeant.
Ben Cousins is exactly this and remembered.
In 2006, Cousins careered off into a ditch to avoid encounters with police while checking on alcohol, and tried to float the Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but drove the locals to invent a joke "biathlon Ben."
Peter Moody accuses stewards of spying and threatens to leave the equestrian Sport
Peter Moody accused the Racing Victoria Stewards in an attempt to introduce a spy in his stable last year and threatened that immediately leave equestrian.
His target became the stewards and Racing Victoria Ethics Department employees, whom he accused that they have organized a campaign against him personally, and the removal of the Lady from the Start because of violations of the rules on the use of medicines on the day of the launch, on Wednesday, was the final straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always makes every effort, participating in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation, when we were talking about a positive result of samples on the cobalt, which he can't explain.
He held the language on suspicion of spying for a year and a half, and did not want it "looked like a sehlen grapes."
"I'm not going to say anything about it, and suffered for a long time, but sometimes you are so upset him, that is no longer," said Moody.
They know that this went on.
Sometimes react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Today I will go home and sleep.
I want to walk with your head held high and I want my owners knew - I am doing everything possible for them.
When they begin to think that this is not the case, then I will have to stop being a coach.
Then I will have to think what to do with its license.
Earlier, Moody Racing.com poll said during an interview that the Ethics department was trying to spy on his stables.
"A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man whom I would say, if asked, and offered him a job in my stables to transmit information about what I am doing in the stables," said Moody on
They obviously think that I am the fraudster.
If so, all of them, surely, should apply as I attempt to catch him failed.
Robert Ralston, former chairman, David Moody, the current chairman, and Bernard, Executive Director, knew about this all the time and know now.
Should it not make me think that the case becomes personal?
Should not be in the courage and hold accountable for what happens in this business, other people, apart from the coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
So if I was bad for the profession?
Maybe people think that it is.
Maybe they need to take away my licence and me away, and I have no doubt - that I now say, may make them think about it.
But now I have come to the point where I am anyway, and it is sad to me.
It really is sad to me.
I will put pressure on them and will put on them the responsibility for decision making.
I have the support of the family, and I can leave.
The annoyance of the trainer only grew during the long investigation of cobalt and case, and the recent removal of a horse from the start forced him to declare that he can "hurl your license on the table."
Moody, the most famous that prepared the invincible Black champion, called the requirements for the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition "ridiculous" after the horse suffered a compress to his feet of clay, which is a violation of the rules.
This is a violation of rules at the races.
"I have to bear full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly made a compress on her leg.
She could get a compress yesterday evening.
She could get it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody may be disqualified for three months according to the rules about the use of medications on the day of the competition for the use of washcloth over what stewards opened an investigation.
This is a joke.
People that create these rules, know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it went too far," Moody said.

"Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy strikes back accusations of rivals in the application of hard power methods

Sydney Roosters "coach Trent Robinson said that the judges have allowed" "" fight "with his team during a sudden" victory "in the final qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Broncos coach Wayne Bennett has made a clear "shades" Storm "after his team won the final qualification tournament" Queensland "on Saturday night, when he called this game" typical "for rugby league and claimed that two of the Queensland teams were not" too successful "in hand-to-hand combat.
Bellamy defended intercepting the ball his team and said that they were simply concentrated on "contact" with the help of the ball.
Bellamy added that he inspired confidence in the criticism of his team by two leading coaches, because it means that their worries a possible defeat from "Storm."
"It continues to surface - I have not heard that Trent Robinson spoke about the hard, when they beat us with a score of 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can vouch that we haven't changed a whole year in their systems or techniques of protection, just over the last six weeks we paid special attention to the contacts with the interception of the ball, and it was a turning point for us.
Trent there three years and he obviously trains excellent team, so he is probably not used to play, and for him it was a certain shock.
Funny how it always is at this time of year.
Bellamy Bennett shot the idea about "spectacular football," referring to his teacher that "Dragons" Bennett won the championship in 2010, showing the "boring" football.
Wayne says about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night, and see how impressive was their game, "Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010. "St. George" many criticized as boring team, but Wayne has stated that it does not care about it.
But now he has a team that can show what he finds impressive football, especially their young midfielders with their speed.
This is football, who would you want to play when you have such players.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants to play football in his style - not each team has two such halfback, Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they could have tried to play.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things, because they are somewhat concerned about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably did not think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game "" and "" Roosters was competition with lots of points than the Broncos "game" and "the."
The game, "Broncos" probably was good, I still have not seen it, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game he was 20: 18, it was still two attempts - and that, this is an impressive football?
Or consider the impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts?
For me it is routine.
If they mention about us, this means that at some stage we can meet them there.
"" at the end of this week off because they won the right to host either North Queensland "or" Sharks "next Saturday evening at the preliminary final at the stadium Park, tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.

Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that he should support the injured Jack's all before the game against Dynamo Zagreb "
In a conversation with Wenger also stressed that still only September, and that if the recovery of all will go according to plan, there is no reason for him to return to the game for Christmas.
Under the most favorable developments Wilshere definitely skip at least four of the following games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
Shameful in this recent problem is that Wilshere confidently finished the previous season with the only ankle injury and was going to go back to the usual aggressive style of play during the pre-season.
Wenger: "This injury does not threaten his career.
It is simply not up to the end of the bone.
Nothing serious.
It is just a coincidence.
It is not linked to or from injuries that have happened before.
This may be related to things from the medical point of view, but also made Wenger, there is juxtaposed against this risk of additional injury for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, have all recorded 23 different injuries, calamities with him for six years since his debut.
Moreover, he played in only 65 of 157 games for Arsenal in the league over the last five seasons.
If you look at the makeup for the "Arsenal" wider, you will notice that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, "Arsenal" was one of the two clubs in the Premier League, which most missed because of injuries.
Wenger admits the probability of being stuck in a vicious circle, but in an "Arsenal" believe that the improving statistics on the injury last season will continue.
"Sometimes, coming back into operation after the injury, you spent some time harassing vulnerable - during this time you need to recover and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough and will cope.
I hope he recovers physically, I am sure in this, as in that his career will be such that he deserves.
Arsenal begins to campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday with a "match" and will continue her Saturday games with Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur in London next Wednesday - with "", and Wenger intends to hold a rotation of composition.
Hector and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, therefore, likely to be in the starting lineup will play Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta.
Perhaps Wenger also enters into the composition of Gibbs and Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott instead of Nacho.
"I try to keep balance and give a small respite for those players who need it," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal have an absolute favorite in group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among the most dispiriting in Europe.
"Dynamo" does not lose any of the 41 matches since they have managed to spend last season as "Invincible."

: UK manufacturing PMI shows that it us serious lessons of male Friendship
The absence of such stories catches the eye, especially given how desperate was the need for men in candor, now more than ever, while the suicide rate among young men is at its highest level for 15 years.
In 2013 it became the single biggest cause of death in men between the ages of 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom, and it happens with men three times more often than women.
In an attempt to sort out the problem of "Campaign against the miserable life" announced 2015 Year of men in order to challenge the culture that does not allow men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students, interested in the symptoms of depression, found that if a patient has a sufficiently large number of "friends" in a normal mood, the chances of cure are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends twice reduces the chance of occurrence of mental disorders.
But, of course, that friendship was, first and foremost we need to be.
In an age when communications are controlled by social networks when style prefer content, speed of response is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life, doubling the need to appear strong, loving fun and successful, even if in reality there is loneliness.
Such a superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship that stronger affects our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently observed, the creator of the video game for money actually does not buy more happiness.
The dignity of Friends is that they attract attention to it.
Each of the characters was defined not by his work, but rather through personality, which has manifested itself in fellowship with friends.
Joey and Chandler's embrace of Humor, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Rachael Ross on - everything comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often abstain from complete study of their feelings.
As the employee told me, "":... "my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal moods, underscores how even a small fellowship of friends can benefit."
Often those men who turn to us, feel unable to speak with friends.
The old teaching "live with it" strongly, as well as a sense that a frank conversation about the problems can be viewed as a weakness. "
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer a more enduring working coping mechanisms.
It highlighted a discreet moments of male friendship.
As for my tasks, the status of a stranger on the phone, helps people in moments of despair, long-term support also comes from the middle of the circle of family and friends.
So if you visit in Comedy Central this weekend, where fully restored for holiday decorations, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see a solitary man in Starbucks, smile and say "Hello."
In advance not to guess what benefits it can bring to the friendship.

Di Maria scores, helping "PSG" smash "Malmö"
Ángel di Maria on par with Matuidi and Cavani celebrates scored balls in Malmö "gate."
Ángel di María, in the Champions League, scored a goal than allowed "PSG" easily circumvented "Malmö" on Tuesday.
Here is a report about the match and the reaction to the game.
Ángel di María and Edinson Cavani did the trick, when Paris Saint Germain "began its game in the Champions League with an extremely comfortable victory 2: 0 against Malmö" "at the Parc des Princes Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after he started his first game in the Champions League as a player, "PSG" to set the direction of the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increased their advantage when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with the "Real Madrid" and Shakhtar Donetsk in the group, "Bet" need to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, because they're not on the qualification play-offs, and the continuation of a series of successful games the last three seasons where they reached.
They have earned points, but at the same time was not the best solution by Laurent Outdo Count Zlatan Ibrahimovic is useless in the attack and later to replace him on the field in a game against the team from his native city and the club where he began his glorious career in 1999.
"It is not easy - win at home or visiting in the Champions League, so to win with a score of 2: 0, deliver opponents problems and play defense - this is a good start, even if there are still moments that we will need to finish during the season," said Blanc.
This is promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I regret that we have not scored one or two more goals.
Ibrahimović returned after injury in one of the replacements as part of the Parisian team that brought her to a draw with the score 2: 2 in a match with Bordeaux in the First League at the weekend, but his backseat overshadowed di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker noted as a player able to withdraw "PSG" to a new level in Europe, after it last month bought from Manchester United, and he showed why, when he ran onto a pass from Marco Verratti behind the protection of "Malmö and beautifully completed the attack, sending the ball past Johan in the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone is then expected from "PSG" light and great victory, they had disappointed.
"Malmö, which defeated Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, with a composition of nine world-class players on the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two pivot midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of Nikola Strike, in which the ball flew past the distant bar-bell gate of Kevin in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
But "PSG" occasionally Jesus himself gears and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who is only in the first half failed to realize at least five attempts, and then couldn't handle the ball, Cavani scored immediately after the resumption of play.
Nevertheless, he showed himself far more skillful in precise, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, having received that, Di Maria sent the ball a blow, who has come quite to the Son of a stange past 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, scored his sixth goal of the season after after Ibrahimović corrected the ball sent to the center of the field with the left flank of Maxwell.
It ended any ideas that were "Malmö" about returning to the game, and only to intercept the ball at close range has not allowed David Luiz to increase the final bill before his replacement Lavezzi goal not been counted in the end of the match.
The coach "Malmo" later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then we have played only in the Swedish league, and it's not the level.
Qualification is not enough.
Glory to "Bet"!
It was a wonderful match with them.

Lead Economy - Nobel laureate: globalization
Print out the processes of globalization were supposed to contribute to the reduction of inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in incomes in emerging economies, by contrast, is growing.
Eric.
To fix this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, believes the chief Researcher of the International Laboratory Analysis and selection decisions of the HSE, the Nobel laureate in economics, 2007 Eric.
In the past twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade between the two countries became increasingly open borders.
Proponents of globalization have predicted big gains for emerging economies.
"And these predictions came true in many respects," said.
For example, China and India have a serious growth in GDP per capita.
However, all is not so rosy.
It was expected that globalization will reduce the gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" in poor countries, which is manifested in a large income inequality, or more precisely - wages.
But in fact it is only increased inequality, notes Eric in his article "Why Global markets do not have reduced inequality in developing economies, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which translated and quoted by the HSE.
In conjunction with the economist, Harvard University professor Michael Eric developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the difference in income rises in poor countries as globalization, reminiscent of the HSE.
In the new global market specific processes occur.
To demonstrate, allocates four levels of qualifications professionals - and B for the rich countries, and D - for the poor.
After globalization D professionals from poor countries lack the skill level to cooperate with specialists and B from rich countries.
And if workers from poor countries With salary levels are rising thanks to cooperation with the staff of B from the rich, workers D growth does not feel or their wages are falling at all.
The final effect is that internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the wage gap between the two categories of specialists in poor countries and correspondingly increasing levels of inequality.
And E. offered a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative theory of comparative advantage.
It helps explain why globalization has led to income inequality, "says Fuad Aleskerov, Professor, Head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and selection decisions, head of the Department of Mathematics of the HSE.
And like any powerful theory, I am sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the employees themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the means to do so, and unprofitable companies to pay for their training.
In such a situation, the government can play a significant role, international agencies, Ngos and private foundations, said.
The scientist notes that developed the theory in no way calls to stop the globalization process, which brought and brings its fruits in the form of GDP growth.

Wheelchair users who arrive for flights, two passengers with fractures on board, Trappes was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For the present airport - hell.
For those who had settled in the hangar - a standard set of tasks that lie ahead for beginners.

They now employ four hundreds of students from metropolitan colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn everything about the inner world.
Passenger check-in, maintenance of planes, baggage turnover - they even entrusted buses to the flight field, ladders and screening of passengers.

The United States Embassy regrets about closing the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia has expressed its regret in connection with the closure of the Library for Foreign literature benefitted at the American center.
The center worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow is deeply regretful about the Russian government's unilateral decision to close the American Center of the U.S. Embassy in the All-russian State Library in Moscow.
"Unilateral steps taken by Russia recently, questioning the government's commitment to Russia, relations between the Russian and American peoples who have not been interrupted, even during the Cold War, and in other complex moments in a long history of relations between our countries," US ambassador John F. Tefft said in a statement, Interfax news day.
American Center created deep and strong connections between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
He was a center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American personalities, among whom were cosmonauts, actors, athletes, scholars, politicians and writers.
"Only last year the American Center spent more than 400 cultural and educational events and took more than 50 thousand Russian visitors," the diplomat said.
Death recalled that about a year ago, the decision was made to close another joint Russian-american project - a program of educational exchanges FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was swift on reprisals.
The typical situation: four officials stand in front of the judges table Kumar, showered his claims against the work done.
The Court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We have not provided you 110-страничный ordered you to him, "Kumar says.
If there is at least one more brick, we demolish all existing buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NRT) - the authority of the judiciary, established in 2010 to stop the rapid environmental pollution that accompanies rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal had to consider more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, collecting garbage, geological developments, toxic waste and construction of dams.
In two of the three cases the court decides to stop construction, leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: during the last 60 years since the announcement of the independence of supercharged industrial development, India has gone from a country of pristine jungle in one of the most densely populated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in big cities, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: the city covered by dense smog, the rivers are filled with pesticides and waste companies and households, and the few remaining residential arrays are cut under the construction of new residential area.
Despite the formal support of the green movement from the state, NRT is regularly criticized by Narendra Modi's government, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
So, in May of this year, the environment Minister, called the Court decision "extreme" and "unsustainable."
Sometimes the court decisions really impossible to fulfill the court delivered in time, confirms the Environmental lawyer for Raj.
But unrealistic deadlines have a positive side: at least they are forcing officials to wriggle.
"His main goal is to shake up this system," added the lawyer.
Green Tribunal has repeatedly canceled large construction: on his account of the termination of the construction of the airport, power stations and hundreds of smaller structures.
At the same time people try not to forget too: for example, during the discussion of the fate of the pharmaceutical company in the state, the local river fluoride.
We can close down your factory, but we are responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," Kumar commented on his decision.
But such explanations have not always find understanding ordinary people, whose lives may change, thanks to one of the judges of the pen.
In April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years old to enter the capital than provoked public outrage.
Despite the popularity he accidentally drops his smoking dramatically and a flurry of criticism, Kumar refused to overturn the decision.
Instead, he ordered the government of Delhi and statistics about the vehicle, and also made a proposal to buy 10,000 additional buses, previously learned in factories if they will be able to perform such an order.
As the scope of the court attention began to be sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents, popular anger began to abate.
But the most sick topic of principled judges became a program to clean up the river Ganges, with fanfare, announced by Prime Minister Modi in the past year.
When it comes to the Ganges - a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often ceases to control their emotions and passes to the scream.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Somebody poured water from the Ganges on the statue of the God, and it turned out to be faeces, "judge."
You continue to pollute the river, because they think: the Ganges is the Ganges, he will take away all our sins.
This is a river that we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
The Ganges is the most ambitious and costly environmental cleanup project, the new government.
Currently, the amount of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm in more than 120 times.
Every year from 1.5 to 3 of the 700 million Hindus bathing in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even sacrificed in the Ganges Rescue Fund money, the proceeds from the sale of his suit, in which he met with Barack Obama and still 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: The suit was bought for 700,000 dollars, while on the river cleanup required at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agreed that India faces a still a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but does not believe that the price of progress should be ecology.
"In a developing country talk about the environment is often perceived as a luxury," says an activist organization "Call of the Ganges" Malik. "
And the court tries to find a balance between ecology and evolution. "

Xi calls for making the economy more open to the World
The economy must become more open to the world to spur its growth as President Xi said Tuesday in a speech to the group, facing the task of leadership reforms.
"China should concentrate on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop a policy of openness," he said, referring to the participants of the 16th Meeting of the Committee of the Central leading group on comprehensive deepening of reforms.
He said the expansion of openness and a deepening of reform will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide new space for economic development.
The leading group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of regulation for investors to access the market, changing the rules of border controls, the promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE), attracting private capital and review of the registration system.
According to the statement, will be compiled a list of sectors of the economy and production, unavailable for investment.
The system will be gradually debugged through pilot programs.
This is an important step, because it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources, ensuring the rule of law in business and increasing openness, said in a statement.
The government also will weaken control of the powers granted to them to companies, thus ensuring that companies themselves will conduct their business.
The statement also says that China will allow the border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to strengthen local growth.
Even more areas will be available for private investors to increase openness by state-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The Government will not change its policy on foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign financing, as well as provide them with the best conditions," it said in a statement.
