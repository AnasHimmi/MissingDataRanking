The couple had a dog named Lanting, who lived with them in Gauthier in a brick house, which is on the opposite side of the channel.
According to the police, the dog is all right.
Former husband Prentiss, Sean O'Brien Steen, said that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter, who is now 19 years old.

Some tried to label the puller attached to him.
Other officials dismissed the, dismissed as a joke.
And some require scandal.
But as neither are some Republicans shake high positions of Donald Trump in the polls, they could not (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed an advantage of Donald Trump in double-digit numbers, and some are beginning to seriously ask, what does this mean for the real estate magnate in terms of chances to get the nomination.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that the Republican Party has a chance nominated Trump.
Experts indicates that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry lagging behind their German John preimgesvo at ever higher popularity, none of whom scored and one state in the nominating process.
And there are many reasons why he would want to fight the general election.
But outside groups, such as "which political actities" Jeb Bush, and economic conservative group "growth club" recognize an unrelenting force Trump and begin to pull their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some poll numbers, which suggests that the real estate mogul is not just an intermediate phase:
Sympathy for Trump ratings have been 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in the middle of June, the Monmouth University poll showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have treated this taste in real estate.
By the middle of July it was 40 per cent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive attitude to Donald Trump type.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators brings up in the initial stages.

Only two out of 10 say they would be "disappointed" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm, as Trump (43 per cent say they would react "with delight" against 40 percent who said the same thing about tramp).
The next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, who is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they would be "not satisfied" or "upset" if favorite establishment Jeb Bush would be a candidate.
Most Republicans do not believe Trump's temperament.
While Trump widely criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 percent of voters across the country by Republicans think that the magnate the right temperament to be president, as shown by the ABC News / Washington Post poll conducted Monday.
The same figure appears on the ground in the country closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he is the man who could be the top commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 per cent think that he is not a man who can be effective in the post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Izbiratelirespublicans gets used to this idea.
When they wear their hats connoisseurs, izbiratelirespublicans think that Trump is seriously.
On the question of who is the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was the favorite, according to a poll by CNN / thirst last week.
This is not so, when four out of 10 have set on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have previously had no right magical crystal.
At the same time, in the last cycle of four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most probable candidate, while only 28 percent supported the eventual candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it shows that many GOP voters believe Trump campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans have rallied around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of all others.
Some pundits say that such variation will likely play at Trump's advantage, and at the same time do not support Trump evenly distributed among supporting more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll in early September, Monmouth University shows that, in a hypothetical competition "one on one" between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always receives majority support.
He Fiorina Carly ahead by 13 points, Marco Rubio on 14 points, Walker on 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie on 33 points.
He had a draw with Ted cruise.
The only candidate who passes him?
Ben Carson obgonyal businessman on the whole 19 points in a hypothetical competition "one on one."
Slightly more than half of the supporters of Donald Trump say that they had changed their minds.
Shifting Focus From Boxing Arena / CBS New poll, conducted Tuesday, shows that just over half of the voters who support Trump, say they are confident in their voices.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he never changes his decision.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
The N, the most tense competition with Trump at the moment - with collegoyautsiderom neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they had changed, most likely, will choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.

So, until immigration attracts attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Frustration with the government is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now rely on support from roughly half izbirateleyrespublicanev, mainly due to its status as an outsider.
Six out of 10 Republicans on Monday a new ABC / Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than a person with experience in government.
And they are also very much aggrieved at Washington.

The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 - in WA, having achieved sales of 500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
The loss of revenues and sales volumes of foods with a high level of fixed costs Metcash can cost companies about 13 million earnings before interest and taxes, says Mr Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and that in a recent survey of Morgan survey found that the IGA had the most loyal customers.
At Morgan Stanley believe that the Metcash food sales would fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company's share in the market from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading stock manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said those attending the business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash "could likely to disappear within a decade.
The company has refused to comment on the comments of Mr. Douglas Metcash.
But it is expected that the Metcash board member company contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's share in the market has declined since 2010 from 18 to 14 percent, and income from Metcash business in the sphere of food products, which the company supplies around 1,200 retailers IGA, fell by 43 per cent compared to 2012 due to operational deleverija and due to pressure on sales and profitability.
Nevertheless, the company does not surrender, spending more than 150 million dollars annually for the sake of uravnivania retail prices with prices at Coles and Woolworths for a thousand items every week and helping retailers IGA in rebuilding trading platforms, as well as offering fast expanding range of fresh products and a wide range of branded food products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says that price equalization and equipping of retail space is gaining momentum, and hopes that the company will increase net profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Kokkinakis Tanasi supports Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Kokkinakis Tanasi deserves honor, rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis indirectly suffered in the recent scandal around his friend Nick Kilosa and for his behavior deserves the honor more than critics, as Tennis Australia president Steve Healy said.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in the talented duo and often called the "Special Ks," unwittingly found himself at the center of attention because of the shameful Kiros shouting with Stan Wawrinka at Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after that, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati judge on the steeple had twice Kokkinakis apart and his opponent Ryan Harrison, Harrison said: "should have been put on the blades Wawrinka Kiros, but I must put this guy on the blades."
Since the last time we saw Kokkinakis Lomas racquet after a convulsive shudder in his leg saved Rishar Gale from possible defeat at the US Open, Healy faithfully defends Kokkinakis.
The boy is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam grot for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomic in singles in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I keenly experienced about one thing, namely that Thanasi took in conflict," said Healy.
He really broke the racquet when he drove a leg at the US Open, but he is not the first player who broke down over the racquet when hope, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure that he would not be proud.
But in fact he owned a very good in quite a provocative situations for us, with Harrison, etc., and I am sure that he is credible.
A great team around him, he has a wonderful family, and I just think that it had a little dishonest.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works a lot, perfectly fits into the team, he has never had a problem with other players, his respected outside the courts, he is training, he is in excellent shape, he's very career and developed a young man, and I think that it should appreciate.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiros for an important match that starts on Friday, believing "mutual consent" the right solution for everyone, but hoping that a guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.
"first of all, we want the team fully focused on the match and not on the dispute around & #91; Kiros & #93;," Healy said.
And I think Nick gained momentum very quickly that prove people like same Federer and Marray, it grows in the eyes of the public, he made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we're trying to help him understand the implications of their actions, and needs to be, I believe, to withdraw it from the center of attention for a while, so he could reflect on them, and it is best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces emergency, closes the border, migrants
Announcing a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia on the southern border and restrain those who try to enter the country illegally, to contain the vast tide flowing into the flow of migrants.
There have been riots at the border - hundreds of migrants has accumulated in the border area, which had reacted negatively to the Serbian authorities.
Anchored for an indefinite time on the road between the two countries controlnopropusknymi points, people fleeing armed violence at home, smashed tents and settled in the area.
But anger rose.
When the police helicopter scattered over them, the migrants shouted "open the border!" and hurled insults at the Hungarian police.
Some refused to food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary when more and more comes from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, rather than collateral damage.
It is necessary in the coming days to hold talks with Brussels and other countries, "Serbian politicians like Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Unrest on the border began the next day vengerskoserbskoy after a block of 28 countries could not develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to take overall responsibility for 40,000 people seeking asylum in crowded in Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future (in the next month or toward the end of the year) will be reached agreement, according to which the EU member states will take another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded to convene an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis that has gripped the continent.
Hungary, however, hopes for quick action on the part of Brussels or neighbors.
Announced on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities more power to act against the crisis, which allowed them to block roads and speed up court cases for asylum.
Meanwhile, Peter Siart Vengie foreign minister said that his country plans to also build the barbed wire fence on the border with Romania, to halt the flow of migrants through the country, now, when she finished the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagate said that even the prisoners were connected to the urgent work on completion of the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary became the main "bottleneck" and EU border crossing point for immigrants, many of whom are refugees - the victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East countries.
Nevertheless, the country's Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most people arriving in the country are economic migrants, those seeking a more prosperous life, not refugees - the victims of the military actions that have the right to protection, and this view is sharply at odds with the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, in Hungary in force at midnight, believe a crime is now crossing or damage 4-Ð¼ÐµÑÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ (13-ÑÑÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¾Ð³Ð¾) barbed wire fence, built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include a more lengthy prison terms for accused of human trafficking.
"because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," a government spokesman told reporters in the southern city of Szeged Zoltan from.
We clearly have to understand: illegally crossing the border is a crime.
Formally, the parliament still must authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are on the border, already in a few days watching there presence of armed to the teeth with military vehicles and dogs.
Died Bakondi, Orban's national security adviser, reported finding the authorized bodies of 45 people attempting to cross the border, the border, and another 15 people - inside the country.
They crossed the border, breaking the fence, are currently under police custody and accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities quickly rebuild the fence.
The Hungarian government on Tuesday morning also closed two of seven passes on the border with Serbia, driving to block one of the passageways railway car, obtan barbed wire.
Unrest erupted at the main passage across the border near the town of Rose (Hungary), as Hungarians have placed an for people inside a metal container, and crowds pressed each other to get inside.
Managed to penetrate about 20 persons, at the same time, thousands of people were left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main driving, leading from Serbia to Hungary, and announced the rejection of food and water, as long as they do not miss in Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton advantage over Bernhard Sanders has fallen by half in the national survey
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold the two-digit advantage in the Democratic race for the nomination all over the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent among primary izbirateleydemocratov (down from 58 per cent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to participate in the presidential race, receives the support of 15 percent of primary izbirateleydemocratov.
For more than five months before the start of the competition in the primary elections, most izbirateleydemocratov say it is too early to speak about what they decide a candidate, which will support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in his choice than podderjvangie other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has made some bonuses.
Clinton holds a big advantage among women and moderates, but this advantage has been reduced.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders lags behind her by just 5 points.
Preference for Clinton izbiratelamidemocratami up to 50 years old, disappeared, and they are now on an equal footing with Sanders.
But Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton obgonyala Sanders on the two-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of five points in this group.
Nearly half of the primary izbirateleydemocratov across the country say they would enthusiastically supported Clinton, if she became a candidate from the party.
A quarter would have backed her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six percent did not support it.
Perhaps it is not surprising that the current Clinton supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm at its expense.
Among those who are currently not supporting Clinton, looks more contradictory - only about a quarter would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48 percent of primary izbirateleydemocratov say they would enthusiastically supported Clinton, fewer izbirateleyrespublicanev say the same about its leader, Donald tramp (35 per cent).
When Clinton supporters is an open question, why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then now is the time that a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 per cent).
Clinton supporters also say the association linking it with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also called soglasne on issues and the chances of the election.
Because the vice president is contemplating potential participation in the election, 57 percent of primary izbirateleydemocratov wish that he joined the race - though one-third thinks that it should not.
When asked who they would like to see on the second place among candidates from the party primary izbiratelidemocrats called Biden's in most cases.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half said that they would chose Biden second, this is more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to stand as a candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among participants race up to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of izbirateleydemocratov see Clinton the candidate with the best chances of winning the general election; however, this figure has dropped from 78 percent in the last month.
In this respect, Biden in a landslide in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate, has increased.
Nevertheless, answering the question, what is most important in a candidate, izbiratelidemocrats choose other options besides the chance to be elected.
A similar situation last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates - is not nepriemlimsm for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have shown good results in some key characteristics among primary voters from his party.
The majority believes Clinton, Sanders and Biden's honest and trustworthy people with good leaders qualities.
Biden from all three leads on honesty, and Clinton's strong point in its leadership.
Thirty percent of primary izbirateleydemocratov does not believe Clinton honest and trustworthy, two times more than those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion about him on this score.
Primary izbiratelidemocrats also generally believe similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden.
For all these measures about a quarter did not have any opinion about izbirateleydemocratov Sanders.
Although questions about the personal mailbox and e-mail server at Hillary Clinton when her secretary of state continues, most of the primary izbirateleydemocratov satisfied with her explanation on this point and believe that it does not impact negatively on their overall opinion about it.
But it is a different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today, her explanation of terror, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion divided about this back in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy over e-mail to have no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent say their opinion of her has worsened.
This is mainly the Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who argue that their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Even though Clinton is honest and trustworthy voters from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points lower compared to last month and 15 compared with May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider her honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not believe Trump honest and credible.
Clinton and trump both, however, get good marks for leader qualities.
Of the six candidates tested Biden, Carson and Bush show the best result of honesty.
Most see Sanders rather honest man than not, but how about Carson, many do not have any opinion about him.
The limit for a sample of 351 primary izbirateleydemocratov errors is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of a national survey of Ben Carson closely approached Donald Trump type
Ben Carson closely came to Donald Trump type in the latest CBS / New York Times poll
These two candidate won half the votes in the new poll, leaving the rest underfoot in search of support
Izbiratelirespublicans across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose support rate increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll, conducted on the eve of the debate on Fox News last month, up to 27% in the poll, which was conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson has soared over the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoys the support of all demographic groups, Trump izbirateleyrespublicanev in the group with higher education.
The rest of the candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, otkatilisi back together with the governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10% in the past month to 2% now.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Sakabe and Florida Senator Marco Rubio together occupy the third place with 6%.
Limit mistakes for a sample of 376 izbirateleyrespublicanev in this latest poll is plus or minus 6%, the survey was carried out in September.
A recent poll from CNN / thirst, published last week, showed growth of Carson in the polls - showing 19% support among Republicans, with 32 percent support for Trump.
The latest ABC News / Washington Post poll also showed that Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
In connection with the growth of Carson's support last week, Trump made a few critical attacks against the former medication, even when Carson apologized for having questioned Trump's faith.
"we need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are accused in the death of Baruch College, a first-year student
About two years after the death of college student during a ritual initiation in the fraternity in the mountains Pocono in Pennsylvania murder charges against five people.
"members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity from New York Baruch College brutally attacked Chan" Michael "Deng during rite-of-passage in September 2013 and took him to the hospital in time, causing his death," police said.
Officials say the student blindfolded and 30-ÑÑÐ½ÑÐ¾Ð²ÑÐ¼ backpack with sand behind pushing several times while he was trying to reach a goal, going on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache, and then fell unconscious.
Members of the fraternity Pi Delta Psi did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and presumably still waiting an hour before delivering it to the hospital, police said.
They, however, found time to change clothes Deng, found in his remote symptoms and contact Andy Meng, national president of the Brotherhood, to ask the Council, told a press conference police chief Chris Wagner.
"at this point, members of the Brotherhood began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the Brotherhood above Deng Michael's health," said the chief of Wagner.
Could not save him, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received some blunt injuries to the head, torso and hips.
"too many families have suffered as a result of the initiation rituals in the Brotherhood, because at least one student dies during them every year since 1970," said in a statement, Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng.
The Brotherhood and their members should be held responsible, and this move on the part of the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County jury bent on murder charges for the first five members of the third degree.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with violence against a newcomer and criminal conspiracy.
"we want to bring to justice not only individual members, but if there is an organization that has it all formally or informally, and her," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and National Brotherhood excluded from its structure of the local department.
What will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
Raising rates will happen, and the market "bulls" stumbles, bond yields will rise, and some economy into recession.
We know this.
What we don't know is how long it will take before, and how long it will last.
Specifically for the economy, there is little that explains about the story.
The recession came just 11 months after the first increase in rates and a whopping 86 months.
The Federal Reserve raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the U.S. central bank administration as strongly emphasizes that investors should not focus on when it will start to raise rates, but how many will take the adaptation.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in play.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss about raising interest rates is exaggerated.
"the first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of" cheap money, "said Julian condemns, senior specialist in international economics at Capital Economics, in his commentary for clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return to more normal interest rates in the United States, but still low levels will be seismic impulse, which many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a look at how they could respond to certain areas of the economy based on historical trends:
As the market has already seen over the last month or so, the expectation of rising rates could lead to instability for some time.
In raising rates, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"it does not appear that the income from shares halt on the next 12-24 months after the first leap, which, again, probably reflects the delay in monetary policy," said analysts at Deutsche Bank in a recent study of the results of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates.
If more specifically, the market is changing dramatically over the past approximately 35 years more often - about 14 percent - in the direction of raising interest rates, remains fairly steady during the 250 days after this (the average growth of 2.6 percent), and then, after 500 days, returning to normal with an average yield of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief specialist in stock trading strategies at Nuveen Asset Management, publikuemomu in Barron's.
At Deutsche say result for securities tends not immediately become more pronounced at the stage of raising interest rates, and income from stocks are beginning to shrink.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often play in raising interest rates.
In this case, the Federal Reserve raised in such conditions, which did not exist before and can accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be at its lowest point for almost all the time of existence of increased rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases Pashena rates since 1950, only two nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few believe that this is for a long time, while in the third quarter he rests on the level of just 1.5 per cent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates on such unstable economic background can be risky and poses the question "whether this time is different," said at Deutsche.
Market participants are bracing for Federal Reserve rate increases throughout the year, with their eyes on the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends Thursday.
While many experts on strategies and economists believe that the FOMC could approve raising rates at this meeting, the index will go up, trade talks about only 25-Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÐµÐ½ÑÐ½Ð¾Ð¹ probabilities.
"in our study, from 1950 all the cycles of raising interest rates until today were in the Grand Supercycle increasing financial leverage in GDP which cannot peaks, predvaryauschie recession, very quickly after the start of the recovery," the report said.
By contrast, it was extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the period.
The current cycle at the moment - delines, which the Federal Reserve was waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, he has lasted just 74 months and hasn't ended.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market expects rates to rise, and this scenario in some ways similar to the one that is implemented for shares.
The main difference is that in effect for bonds nastupet faster than for shares when a federal system is changing the strategic course.
In the case of bonds that yield changes immediately after the first increase in vector / reducing rates in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of raising interest rates bond yields fall immediately, "said Deutsche.
From the Charles grand strategy experts believe that raising rates will cause the levels of long-term and short-term bond yields converge, making the curve more of a flat.
Bonds with high returns often behave better in this climate, although "we still worry about fluctuations in return," says the study, Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Grand.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets are already adapted to the expected policies of the federal system.
"in addition to the strengthening of the dollar and a fall in inflation expectations, there are signs that the market podstroilsya to run a tight monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans rose, the yield curve is more flat, credit spreads widened, increased volatility - all the characteristics of the market with policy tightening of the federal system.
Speaking in general, companies, leading the main its business in the United States, will benefit from rising interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be worse off because of the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market, and their debt is more expensive - financially.
"history shows that" quality "stocks are showing the effectiveness of the above market within three months after the initial rate hikes," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Company with a stable financial condition outperformed companies with unstable condition based on the results of each increase in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004, by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high profitability of capital, as well as stocks with low volatility also showed a better performance than that of low quality stocks, on average 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
The debt would be a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of debt mortgages will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to the purely stock transactions, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Investors could see profits through higher yields, though experts disagree on how quickly it will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM," says Andrew Bingham, a member of parliament from the conservative
A member of parliament from the Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "lowering standards"
Proves that it is becoming less otlicimoy from commercial rival
Also has set its sights on the BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize simply Sodra with Brits.
Colleague in Parliament Damian Collins that had befallen the voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM,," said the leader of the members of parliament, prompting radio company to prove that it is doing anything that did not make commercial companies.
A member of parliament from the Conservatives, Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that it seems as if public radio station "glupeet" and becomes less otlicimoy from its commercial rival.
"radio 3 - I don't like to use the word" simplify "- but it seems she turns to Classic FM," he said.
He also has set its sights on the BBC Music Awards launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like the Brits under a different name.
So if you try to do something else - here are two examples that I first came to mind, in which you really only duplicate what is already on the market, "said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC director general has denied the accusations, claiming that the BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial rival, when it comes to live music and education.
What I know thanks to Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live music performances and create more do not actually match with anyone.
"there really is very important, I think, in search of new music and Radio 3 interest in promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that the radio stations have to work much more to attract an audience than in the past, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, it was not the only offspring of BBC Radio 3, which has been under attack for nastupanie on commercial competitors during the hearings, the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of parliament from the Tories Damien Collins has attacked the voice - the musical talent show, which the BBC bought the Dutch Talpa Media for the approximate price of Â£22 million.
See why this program is often discussed in connection with the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall said the BBC 1 show, which as the judges involved Paloma Veith and Boy George, was done in the "typical style of the BBC."
He added that he wants from the corporation to the hit "found in his own home stable" next time she will run the entertainment project.
But he does not interfere with the order of the new season sees fit the voice in the future or the use of money, those who pay license fees to other entertainment formats.
Internetprodaj maximum growth slowed in August, and it could be a Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015 onlaynprodaj increased by seven percent
Last month marked the slowest growth since it began observing in 2000
Onlaynprodaji occurred three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that the November Black Friday could help curb spending
For about 10 years, virtual shopping is experiencing a boom, turning many central streets in Britain in gorodaprizraki.
But experts say that now there are signs of leveling onlaynprodaj, after recent data showed only semiprocentnoe increase during the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure on onlaynshopping in August showed minimal growth since they began to record in 2000, an increase of just five per cent.
Experts say that now there are signs of leveling onlaynprodaj, after the latest data showed only semiprocentnoe increase during the first three months of 2015
"if you look at the rate of growth in previous years and return back to 2000, they can always find a reasonable explanation," - told the Guardian Andy Malahi, editor of IMRG sales index.
He explained that onlaynprodaji occurred three years ago, when consumers were using their mobile phones to shop.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do it under any circumstances, for example, sitting on the couch.
But now it is on the plateau, and you can see lower (growth).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slow sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, the number of buyers in five times the average hurried back to computers to take advantage of favorable offers, "thus a number of Web sites of sellers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when customers come into a real fight for lucrative purchases, could force people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a slightly more than 1 pound out of every 5 dollars spent online.
In the case of goods such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, rather than in the fashionable shops on central streets.

It is said that the British delay in the direction of hammers and paint brush and instead hire qualified to perform work in the home of Eastern Europeans from
If you know how to handle a hammer or cleverly to paint the walls, it seems that these days you are in the minority.
Because, according to the organization B & Q, the British all cage hire to perform simple specialistovmasterov household chores.
Veronic Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the network services on the construction of houses, said that behind this trend is a significant influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, offering services at competitive prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 stores Screwfix, specializing in products for craftsmen, and at the same time close 60 magazinovscladov B & Q.
Ms. Laurie told me that would like to see more women in the B & Q store staff, as eight out of ten decisions on purchases in the store accepted members of the weaker sex.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to her, it is impossible not to notice and recent demographic trends, with the growing number of households consisting of single women who are engaged in the arrangement of their homes longer than in the past.
Ms. Laurie said: "in our stores are still predominantly male.
It is necessary to take steps to achieve balance.
In general, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of decisions on purchased goods are taken by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laurie is one of five women, standing at the helm of leading British companies whose shares are taken into account in the FTSE100 index - also changed the composition of the team topupravlencev, among the directors of equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the chief executive and chief financial officer.
Ms. Laurie said: "this was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Find suitable women to the board of directors was easy.
After the group assumed the costs of closing stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales volumes for six months.
As a result of this trend Kingfisher, which owns B & Q and Screwfix brands, opened 200 new stores
Decision time for the US Federal Reserve interest rate
The world is watching of the Federal Reserve Bank meeting at which over two days is the adoption of an important decision - whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in the last decade.
The poll of 80 economists conducted by Reuters, found that slightly more than half of those who are still last week believed that the Federal Reserve would go for it, now believe that he still prement and keep rate at the level of the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, because it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to zero.
For the first time we come to the fact that the main bank could move from zero and begin the process of normalizing interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is operating efficiently, economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to balance report, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets that we should prepare for change, but everyone says about their confidence that all the odds against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 8pm CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
"open!" - shouting out hundreds of refugees at the border checkpoint at Horgos serbskovengerskoy.
Budapest closed the border for migrants from Tuesday.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to've been groping around other options in the European Union.
One of them to bypass the closed border with Serbia lies through Romania.
The other is through Croatia and Slovenia - in Austria.
According to some reports, the bus, which was carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary, now heading towards the city of Sid on the Croatian border.
The drivers received orders from authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovich assures that his country is doing everything it can to help refugees, but its options are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, to provide a humane attitude to them.
But this is a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve, no country in Europe alone will not do it, and the more such a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border for the refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's:
If someone were called by a refugee in Serbia, he has to fill in the required documents.
And if he does, and he realizes not in our country, because it is quite safe in Serbia.
Hungary already has enthroned 175-ÑÐ¸ÐºÐ¸Ð»Ð¾Ð¼ÐµÑÑÐ¾Ð²ÑÐ¹ fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to build a fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that it is incompatible with European principles.
Meimarakis Vangelis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Meimarakis for years in center-right governments have left the country to the financial crisis.
Now he became interim leader of the New Democracy party, "Tsipras defies.
A few days before the election, he met with euronews journalist.
Euronews: Mr Meimarakis, welcome to euronews.
Meimarakis Vangelis: thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: nine months ago, your party failed resoundingly, relinquishing the Syriza coalition, but for now, judging by the polls, New Democracy sravnyalasy with her popularity.
What has changed in the meantime?
Meimarakis Vangelis: Greece has changed, and we too.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and growth prospects.
Now the country has over budget deficits and high unemployment.
Investors have left, because Mr. Tsipras ousted them.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks had an opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promise of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare the promised with what really happened.
Daily life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and it concerned the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: but you say that in the event of an election victory will seek alliances with other parties, including Siris.
Vangelis Meimarakis: the fact is that, as we have learned over the past few years, Greece could not move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where acted or still operate the rescue program, the political forces and all the ruling parties came together to implement the program on which they reached agreement, without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: your party voted in support of the agreement between Mr Tsipras and creditors of the country.
If you are going to become the new premier on Monday, will you do this agreement, or try to change it at least partly?
Vangelis Meimarakis: we actually voted for the movement of Greece in the European way, because we are good, how devastating consequences would lead the country out of the EU.
Now Europe helps us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have the solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would be lost if there was no agreement with Europe.
But the current austerity measures are a result of the way Mr. Tsipras negotiated.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government during the first year in power wants to impose order, acting rationally and makes clear that the country has a strong political will for implementing the programme of salvation, then I am sure that all of its obligations, which may not be met due to the fact that lead to the recession, may again be the subject of negotiations, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be a mistake to assume that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to the talks with our creditors, because they expect full compliance with the agreement.
If we want to restore their confidence, we must continue to privatization, reform and structural changes that were agreed on, continuing to benefit from EU funding and exciting investment opportunities that we must open for a better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of the negotiations, the government have not submitted any serious arguments Tsipras on many key political issues that we found out when discussing these issues with our European counterparts.
I can give you an example, linked to the income of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that we are not talking about a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot fully taxed in advance.
They said that Tsipras ministers never talked about it.
In other words, Greek ministers were not prepared and poorly informed and poorly negotiated and signed an agreement.
Euronews: if you defeat at the polls, you will find yourself at one table with Mr Juncker, Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will be what you tell them, from what to tell them your predecessor 5.9 magnitudes quake?
Vangelis Meimarakis: first of all, I will explain to them that, until the end of 2014, we were trying to fulfill the 2012 agreement, bypassing all the sharp edges.
We pushed forward reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extreme circumstances.
The market has fallen, and not seen as potential buyers were willing to pay the price, the Greek government ustraivavshuu.
I was at that time the speaker of the Parliament, I was able to reconcile the views of three parliamentary groups that made up the majority of the then government.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a functioning parliament, and it is in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations held outside.
And we managed to steer the country to a normal situation, which would have continued to improve, if the process was not interrupted envisaging general elections that are the result of December's presidential election.
Euronews: the last few weeks on the territory of Greece is moving a mass flow of refugees.
What do you think about this situation, and the reaction of European countries, who are these people?
Meimarakis Vangelis: refugee crisis is a ticking time bomb, which we will be dealing with after the election victory.
And the reason is that the government's not acted in this situation, as they should.
In such matters should act on the curve, because if the problem gets you, then there are only emergency measures.
And we are now in this situation.
Even the interim government, smenivshee Siris, for only seven days has done more than Mr Tsipras has done for seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which has been providing valuable assistance to the president of the Republic, rightly called on to hold an EU summit will help find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, the notice is not illegal immigrants and refugees.
It is the victims of the war in Syria, the victim of some extraordinary events with them.
This issue is a deeply humanitarian aspect, and we'll stick with the position that European politicians should take in this new situation.
The decision should be taken at the EU summit, should be involved and the United Nations.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and refugee centres.
We must also effectively use economic aid that we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this pressing issue.
Euronews: Mr Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Meimarakis Vangelis: thank you.

A man who opened fire at the University of Delta, left a note with an apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before he shot and killed his colleague later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note in which it says that he "regrets" about the first murder and wanted to "all back," the competent authorities reported on Tuesday.
Police in the town of Gauthier, Mississippi, reported that a teacher of geography and social sciences at the University of Delta, called 911 about 10 a.m. service.
On Monday and reported that he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that police need to send people to his home.
He said: "last night I killed my wife," and also mentioned that the House is "dog," which "no one would bother," but probably upset.
The police asked the caller's name, but he did not tell him.
Lamb did not explain why he opened fire.
Arriving at the scene, police found the body of Amy Prentiss there, 41 years, and a note written by hand from Lamba, 45, in which he said: "I regret that I would like to bring everything back.
I loved Amy and she's the only who ever loved me.
By writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University, where killed ITA Schmidt, professor of history, and on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by police, committed suicide.
William LaForge University rector said that he was not aware of any conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamba clearly there was something on his mind."
Despite Monday to information about what Lamb supposed romance between Prentiss and Schmidt, the official service on Tuesday reported an "absence of any information or evidence of" love triangle. "
About Prentiss disparaged as "a good man" Sean O'Brien Steen, who said that she has been married for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
About 'Steen said that he and press have a daughter, 19, and that she "bezuteshna."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsey Knowles, which San Herald newspaper calls a close friend Prentiss, last worked from home via the Internet.
She told me that there was a hunting dog named Prentiss lasting, and that she met lamb for about three years.
She said: "she always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb on Monday at some point called relatives to say that "he will not go to jail."
In the evening of the same day when police seized him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped his car, jumped out, ran off into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university website, in the spring of 2015 Lamb received a Ph.D. at Delta State University in the field of education.
The Stars have lost their luck
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), went through several difficult years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-standing companion life Terah Fossett, dead from cancer.
According to reports, the actor also suffered from addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this, of course, played a role.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United - for a few months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost the PSV in Eindhoven.
At the same time as the defender is about it, which would not be able to enter the field because at least within six months, Louis Van Gal hopes that the show will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during a reckless podcast Hector Moreno in the 15th minute, when a 20-year-old show stormed into the PSV penalty area.
He assisted on the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before transport to the hospital.
Van Gal said: "he has a double fracture, and he is in hospital."
It will be carried on in Manchester tomorrow or later in the day and then cured.
It's terrible - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and began playing fantastic, and then this happened.
It was the oxygen mask in the locker room.
He wept.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it is for six months, and a guy would not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope that he will be able to play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and the penalty was not scheduled.
Referee Nicola Mexican Rizzoli not punished.
Van Gal believes that an Italian judge had made a mistake.
Judge for yourself, when I say that it is worth the penalty and a red card.
It was too evil you drove with two legs.
In his Twitter show writes: "thank you all for your messages, words can't describe how I am devastated, my path to recovery starts, I will come back even stronger than it was."
More on the topic: Manchester United is experiencing unhappiness with Luke Shaw in defeat in the game with the PSV
The defender will have an additional incentive to take British European Championship in France next June.
Phillip coca, the PSV coach, said: "this is a very severe injury."
When any player should be knocked out with a similar injury, everything is very upset by this.
It was never the intention of our players - to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when playing for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Galya at 2014 World Cup
"now it is very difficult for him, because he had no intention of wounding an opponent, and when you hear that it is a very severe injury, then you feel unwell," Coca said.
I had not been able to see the point.
The only thing that I could see is the ball, which flew in the other direction, so that it looked as if he (Moreno) touched him, but I haven't seen podcast under Luke.
In an interview with the SBS6 Moreno said: "I know what this is, I know how difficult it is to move.
It is very difficult for me, and I am very sorry.
Andres Guardado from the PSV was also taken to hospital after the collision with Chris Molling.
Whether David Cameron knows about "Lorax" anything else?
Every parent's one thing very quickly: if your child liked a book, it will be a bit of time before vybudete know it almost by heart.
Apparently, if you are not David Cameron.
When asked by a representative of the company specialsing in organisation of children's holidays in the holidays, about his favorite children's book, the prime minister chose its sequel released "- tale with environmental problems, written by Dr. sus in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in comments published on the website of the company supercamps, and continues: "this funny, touching, unusual history with a strong message I like to read to their children, because it always show any image or message that we miss."
And all would be well, except in the last paragraph, in which Cameron, as expected, narrates the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the movie, filmed in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify a fairly short original narrative.
"surrounded by high walls vsemnujvill city, where there was no greenery and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey, performing her desire is to see this tree," we read in the text description of a love story, an unknown Dr. Suzu (real name Theodore sus Geisel), in 1991.
If it looks suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads almost like a summary of the story the film its sequel released, Alozen "on the Internet Movie Database:" surrounded by high walls vsemnujvill city, where everything was artificial and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girls of their dreams. "
It seems unlikely that Cameron, though, admittedly, an active parent, so unfamiliar with the content of the book, which is not named for the boy learns about how environmental destroys the greedy vyrubgik trees and Vasal "vsemnujek" Nakhodka, despite protests Lorax (whose name in the title of the book) is ridiculously rendered creatures with mustache, who "speaks on behalf of the trees."
Most likely, such a simple zadacha was assigned to an artist, never Lorax chitavshemu child book about 20 times in a row.
Downing Street spokesman said that the text was supposedly received from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
Supercamps company confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but there was no further comment.
Adam was clearly not to risk for Prime Minister in the England squad, but it is still a difficult question
Victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England selected for this tour, a repeat of the defeat in the Test series, with the score 3-0, what happened last time, does not seem likely to me.
I would also did not deny the victory in his field.
Alastair Cook's team, perhaps less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but in her among Bish there are players, masterly host crucen balls, and collective thinking much; they don't bear the scars of 2012, only a junior positive.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into bowler supplying crucen balls, and Adil Rashid, even if it is an unknown figure to Test level, represents explore your aggressive option.
Still on the subject: Adam lit dropped out of England on your test cricket and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision on the exclusion of Adam prime me, his coach at Yorkshire, "of course, it is difficult to analyze.
His seven Test matches have had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and obvious, but the brutal reality is that cricket players are evaluated by judges on the outcome.
There were no questions about John rut, for example, and that has led to this ad, because (and I have already said this before) the best players choose themselves.
The couple polusoten, and Prime Minister could wait for more prolonged career, but he was in the grip of its own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more rand for "Yorkshire," there will be another opportunity.
England national team head coach, Trevor Bayliss, spoke about his attitude, even when he did not show what can do, and it doesn't surprise me; he is first and foremost a team player, and then everything else.
The question is, how much time will pass before batsmen Test cricket will leave the impression is a complicated question.
Lit played in seven games, as well as Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton - in nine.
Only Compton received a chance to play on her and on another field.
The only thing that you could complain - that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League, when it was in the best form, but this lost opportunity is already in the past.
Alex Hales appears, and he batsman, whom I greatly appreciate.
He cricketist unpredictable that we saw in Yorkshir and at the beginning of this season, the club, when he earned 236 in the match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should be at least given the same opportunity, like those who came before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of putting men near batsmen Cook as an opening that would give the opportunity to introduce extra spinner, keeping four high-speed bowler, considering, and I'm not against it.
See no reason why the kicker can't hit the ball there, and this a lefty has already shown that he is fucking good cricketist.
Men, perhaps not quite what you need for your county Westershire, but became the third number for them, and there is no difference.
My old comrade teammate Justin Langer have studied how played his first 38 Test matches "third batsman," before you go out as an opening in 2001.
He won three hundred and never looked back at once.
Zafar Ansari comes to the national team as a reserve spinner, and when my neprodoljitelnom fellowship with him he was a very promising young man.
People can look at his approximate statistics - an average of 31 with bat and 35 with the ball - and think that it is risky bet, but among spinners voting "for" a bit, and otbirangie chose youth.
He will learn a lot from this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mel jaiauordina, srilankiyskogo batsmen, as a consultant for Test matches, could be on the increase.
He's one of the best guys in the game, who bring in a wealth of experience gained under all possible conditions and in any of the attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games, where the white ball is used, and provide both energy and ruthless Stape pace.
I have always felt that he was born to be zadeystvovannom in international cricket, whether it be a game or training work, and like Mahela, possesses a considerable intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the locker room, even if they say what has already been said previously, can give new strength to the team.
A colleague of Calley teammate Ben Stokes left Durham for mayflies inside me, Rutu provided a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for one, am not about this problem.
Although not everyone will agree with this, coaches and officials, otbirangie players do not determine the schedule.
And you must remember how the players, their positions depending on the results.
Such decisions are never easy.
The camp of Britain's exit from the EU could win if the economy is in a depression by 2017
David Cameron's ill-conceived policy to resume talks about keeping Britain in the EU every day feels more and more difficulties, even without regard to the election of Genius Jeremy "yes or no?" - the leader of the Labour Party or resentment Jujuy corbina over Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their own Faraji and Corbin Nigel.
Friendly European diplomat explained the other day that, in a situation where it is now the EU, various crises ignominy - not all of them their own production - some member states fed up British egocentric see infighting concessions and undermine agreements change agenda, which they mostly do not want.
Gathered in Brighton for the annual meeting, Jujuy has decided that he does not want them in any case, if they destroy social protection.
We could even call it the "self Dave and George."
The prime minister and finance minister to become trees and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the backdrop of the famous local monument, in the company of local celebrities or without it, then come home and say that they attract allies for reform.
This is all about me.
My European friend who wants to represent in maintaining external contacts Britain under EU tent - "not Pidai US together with France," says Berlin - suggests that ministers and officials come in some capitals reached an understanding when they become all the same, we will stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation worsens for her, as she deteriorated for sides in place Thatcher (11 years), mitterrana (14) and Kohl's (16).
French President FranÃ§ois Hollande is facing 14 or replacement in 2017.
He, too, is losing strength.
Poland may soon get the nationalist right-wing government, Spain - the left.
It is hard to see them leasing from the skin out, to help "selfibritam," whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland's exit from the UK - what they didn't want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can even plan for issuing deliberately useless remarks in the style of the SNP during the referendum campaign in the UK in 2017 to spur the process of Britain's exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
"the revision was of" and "Britain had not received anything valuable from the renewed talks."
Europeans for their trouble, know what a predator might be flitstrit and how skeptical towards the EU are media moguls, unlike the Times zapugenogo Tony Benn referendum in 1975, which supported our membership in 1973, a ratio of 2: 1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a downright evroopportunista plaque with its "straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
For all his stupidity Ed Miliband knew who his enemies.
They included members of the company as tax crooks, telephone hackerovchujakov and psevdoneresidentov, which hold the majority of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was absolutely of the same opinion about them, but I understood that when you're in the cage with lush gorilla, you should give her bananas to distract her and not give her to eat you for lunch and tea.
In fact Blair's defender Milliband was greater than that of Blair himself in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, because Blair Menen pupils principles in favor of the EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which issued him a winning ticket.
The press was not prostila none of this.
But milonga Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back at Westminster Petrova on Monday - I told him that he had no more time to spend it on me - it seems that risks repeating the Nile strategy Kinka "boycott Merdoku" from the 80s - an error and then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of interaction with the press - not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marr, on whose couch he was sitting in air force on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I call evolutionirovaniem sensitively.
He said he would like to remain in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside tradiocinalistskoy tendencies of Ukip and a wider range of "Little Britain" among Tory supporters can probably say "yes."
This is the same thing that Hillary "Benn, but not Bennet" Ben said on radio and television this week, while his inner the scout struggling refused to admit that the appointment of John McDonnell Corbyn his terrible shadow "finance minister" was a bad idea.
It reminds me of the 1970s, when his struggling starikotec fought on TV for disloyalty to the Labor Cabinet colleagues, without going too far and not losing his post in the cabinet.
The battle of Hilary was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "under any circumstances" - the phrase Benn - not what, McDonnell said, and not what J. K. said Param and members of parliament on the private meeting Monday night, admittedly.
No Democrat and "would like to inform your guy" Corbyn - remember, he touched even me - discipline remains an important messages in the age of 24-hour television, seven days a week, and particularly in the maelstrom of social networks, the hearth of paranoia and betrayal.
It is prudent not to give Cameron as simply get away from Europe, allowing it to take for granted the support of Labour during a referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the basic fallacy McDonnell and corbina about EU membership - within the framework of the "Benit" economy besieged fortress - is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among leftist dissidents, for whom narcissism, resulting from a slight difference, is a central principle in doctrinal disputes.
As for his confusion about NATO - Tom Watson determined that Ð´Ð¶.Ðº. will not agitate for an exit - Foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring it up to their leaders at home.
Why Paris or Berlin to spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - concessions to Britain, when it can be meaningless?
The United States is already very disappointed by weak British military action in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the government of the Tories in power cuts back on spending about what I was reminded on Monday during a lunch at a forum called British influence security.
Experts have criticized the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
Funded by the government agency claims that electronic cigarettes on 95% less harmful than smoking, have been voiced at the meeting of 12 people, some of whom are related to the tobacco industry, researchers reported.
Experts, publish in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), together with the Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic dragging on their cigarettes.
PHE published an important report - "turning milestone" in the last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers questioned the accuracy of the data and some experts pointed to the connection with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized "extremely wobbly argument," on the basis of which PHE built his main conclusion.
In the BMJ article by two other researchers asked the question whether these statements under a "solid or consumer base."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Gingold's, said: "the fundamental principle of health - rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
According to them, the public expects to PHE statement that "current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes by about 95 percent less harmful than tabakokurenie" were based on a detailed analysis of evidence and modeling.
In fact, it is derived from a single meeting of 12 people who gathered to develop a model multicriterial decision-making analysis in order to consolidate their opinions about the harm associated with various nicotinosoderjatimi products; the results of the meeting are in scientific publications.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called Euroswiss health, the CEO of which, it was reported that earlier he received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed the certificates of bat in healthcare in the report on sustainable development.
One of 12 people at the meeting announced the funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, without mentioning the funding, which he reportedly had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
The rationale behind the choice of board members were not given, but among them there are several prominent supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which also announced funding in the publishing industry.
It is not known whether the other participants of the meeting management experience in tobacco.
The meeting also visited the head of PHE tobacco.
The scientific article published by the group, "gracefully agrees" with the fact that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions have not been affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell told that PHE statement saying that "at present there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, delivers children to smoking or non-smoking," are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and wellbeing at PHE, said that the BMJ allegations were previously answers.
He said: "the electronic cigarette is less harmful than tabakokurenie."
One of the two Kurish life died of his addiction.
All the evidence suggest that health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study distant consequences.
The PHE have a clear duty to inform the public about what prove and what do not prove these proofs, especially where public had doubts about the relative risk compared with tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from diseases related to smoking, and smoking costs the NHS in 2 billion pounds a year.
Clearly defining the obvious - that although electronic cigarettes and are not safe, they are only part of the harm caused by smoking - we perform our tasks in front of the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 believes that the BBC should stop the show EastEnders
The former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop issuing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their competitors in business would give much such successful shows as soap opera about "Albert Square."
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used for the creation of such programmes, which are not produced by other British TV and radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for what the company puts the transfer of public broadcasting, which certainly looks only a small portion of the audience, on peak airtime, when competitors go show with high ratings, and on such channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC director general Tony Hall said the corporation would no longer cooperate with other organizations, Johnson said that he had in his time in six years unsuccessfully tried to establish cooperation with the BBC while working on Channel 4.
"I can't get away from the idea that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcasts, which could show the competing companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee members within the framework of the future fate of the BBC.
If you save the license fee that I don't think a good solution in the medium and long term, the company should be left on the air only those programs that are not produced and are not produced by other companies.
The voice goes on the air in praymslotte, because the creators want to get maximum support for the future.
The idea that no one else did not show it, smehotvorna and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why the regressive taxes should go to finance programs that could sponsored without subsidies.
The voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is common knowledge that they have their own production.
Other channels, no doubt, would give much for it.
I do not understand how it can be public service broadcasting.
I do not think that it would be somehow prinizilo BBC.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed the channel Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC in pursuit of ratings "because of the ambitions of employees, and because of their belief that this is the best way to get the support for a long time."
His comments about the most popular show on BBC resonate with comments Sky executive director Tony also, who in his memory MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested the BBC to sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson noted that more niche BBC transmission public character "continue to go on BBC4, where often cannot be estimated audience but the company performed, and this can be charged as an argument in changes sermons justifying income from licensing fees in 4 billion pounds:" well, yes, of course, we do all these obscure broadcasts that no one is looking. "
They put them in the slot, where nobody will be watching them.
About the license fee Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system with regard to who will get the most from it.
Of course, all of you think, we all think that 150 pounds a year - a huge amount of money, but for people for whom $150 is a lot of money, I wonder, they believe, because they don't really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former executive director of Sky channels and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should review the mission of Rita in favor of "inform, prosvegay and razvlekay."
He noted that only a small portion of the BBC is now formally classified as educational materials - in his words, it is 1% of TV content and 0.1% on the radio - and that the company should catch the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "inform, prosvegay and razvlekay."
On the issues of partnership Elstein said that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "Promenade Concerts" (only some of them, he said, is shown on TV), as well as to enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
"sonogenetika" allows you to manage your brain cells using sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes are changing direction at a time when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists put worms with genetically modified nervous system, which can be controlled using impulse sound waves.
Tiny nematodes are changing direction at a time when they are on sound impulses, too high for the human ear could hear them.
Impulses impact through the activation of neurons, genetically modified to use the membrane channels that respond to the ultrasonic waves.
Another topic: researchers control brain activity with light
The scientists said that worms demonstrate the capabilities of a new technique called "sonogenetika," the essence of which is to use ultrasound for the initiation of certain brain cells, heart and muscles, the ultrasound source is located outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, Calif., told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - the invasive procedure, which sent electrical impulses in the brain and which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Cervinematody usually does not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani discovered that they began to respond when they were placed in a liquid that contains microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles enhance the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the organism worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect structures called trp-4 ion "channels," found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Ultrasonic waves make these ion channels open and cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
For the creation of nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of worms, so their motor neurons used ion channels trp-4.
During the use of ultrasound for influencing the modified organisms sound waves were on the increase in microscopic bubbles and organisms worms, activating a modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one that applies to "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to include neurons on and off using light pulses.
Chalasani argues that compared with this methodology sonogenetika may have some advantages.
In contrast to the light, which is delivered to the target area of the brain by fiber optics, low-frequency ultrasonic waves to freely pass through body tissue, so to deliver them do not have to go inside the responses.
"we believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can in time do human neurons sensitive to breast signal," - Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the method can be applied to the muscular and insulinproducirutm cells.

British arms trade ads scoff
See video of Amnesty International protested against the arms trade.
Stunning dronyubiatsy!
Tibia with iron shackles!
Cluster bombs.
Svetoshumove electric batons, causing unbearable pain, but no traces of the rest!
Cheerful voice and painted animation leave no doubt that this advertising is the largest international exhibition of armaments - Edan parody, prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the intention of the British government to "push" arms to repressive regimes, taking advantage of the Excel centre in Docklands exhibition held in defense technologies and security systems.
Still on the subject: the DSEI arms fair: authoritarian regimes go to London
But a special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters on bus stops and in subway trains, which require a look at them again.
"important announcement, riding on the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them fonts London Underground line with DLR, prevragang in silhouette of the tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms brokers was coming on the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent arms exhibition.
300 posters drawn by artists who put their work at the Museum of Design "in the park" brutal dismalend Banksy "."
The team called "Special Patrol Group" helped spread them in London, using a set of cracker "advertising spots, GEC 6-ÑÑÐ½ÑÐ¾Ð²ÑÐ¹" set of keys, which states, "gives access to approximately one-third of the advertising space on bus stops on the planet."
London no transportnikam from such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody ads produced by a group of "special patrol."
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of the cruel designs and a teacher at the University of Eskom, artists are becoming more demanding and want to bring political art to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists are beginning to work with activists protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of their art, if they want to have an impact on society.
Another poster against arms exhibition, privetstvungiy passengers in the subway.
Video from the amnesty was seen more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and established agency VCCP, working pro bono, with the involvement of graphic designer and artist ozvuchania, also working free of charge.
Creative director of VCCP Matt lever was struck by the silence around the arms of advertising with skip excel in the calendar - and thought: "let us arrange them campaign, which they are trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and hitroumnuu corporate advertising, but "fill her house with bright colors and animation turned out to be more exciting."
"they're incredibly helped us to draw attention to the sale of illegal children equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis from amnesty.
Now we need to make the UK government has taken measures and ensure that this equipment will not be sold illegally pate right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the topic of arms exhibition comes from within Excel, where participants traded fantastically evfemestic products.
In the press release Saab disclosed information about the order "AT4CS RS for shooting from his shoulder," the order from the US army.
It includes a "cumulative warhead, which brings unsurpassed zabronevoe action inside the goal."
Whatever he did, it would not be pleasant.
Eight golden rules of living in student dormitories
Was already 11 years since I moved to the dormitory as a normal 19-year-old man, still verging in berets and moral relativism, but only now I recall forced smiles of those whom I am angry - and numerous, long a complaint on the other.
Basically what I learned, it is possible to spread out in eight simple rules.
Moving to the hostel can vary from the slightly nerve-racking to absolutely disquieting.
He urges talk: to tell people where you are, whether you took a leave and where it was held, do you support and why you corbina "honestly, neither love nor hate" Marmite, "because, seriously, guys, it's just yeast extract, hahaha, I will."
Peredohni.
And help others rest too - ask questions and demonstra interest.
It supports the conversation and helps you find people who you like, not those with whom you would not even talk to, even if you had caught fire, and they would be handed out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
Of the room, people often turn to drinking establishments, and public gatherings (polunoce places, but they also place where people dress and correcting underwear.
Still on the subject: not even think to begin studies at university, being in a relationship
The introvert universities are unfair.
Your room should be a refuge, but many hostels are shaping culture dysfunction from one room to another, that promotes friendship, communication and leads to a long friendship.
It can be hell for whoever is trying to regain power.
Nothing in the culture does not allow you to say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I was able to regain energy, which I spent on communication with you."
Try to feel when tired sokursnik communication - and not Tucat to it, and send an SMS.
By the way, about Stuke: do it.
One guy in my dormitory followed such a principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends with baking.
Because you start university life at the peak of the popularity of the show bake-off, then knock on the door to people, to introduce himself to a plate and chocolate chip cookies, is not such a strange effect, not so reminiscent of the 1950s, with their "welcome, we are neighbors, I'm cooking something for you, and now smile, and I'm going to ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to chat with you, and in the end, it is likely that your face will come to associate them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how you were a good baker.
Marvelous little lumps of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you'll Tucat to them.
Theft of food - a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, assigning someone's chicken - theft, but is this theft - take a little milk for tea?
Check the owner of the milk.
It is likely he will offer you do not hesitate, even if the inside is seething with rage.
If someone is stealing your stuff, it's annoying, and I express my sympathy to you - but try to treat this older than my neighbor, which Aliwal in his milk liquid detergent to take revenge against those who took it without asking.
She is now in jail.
You should not produce noise that will stop people from sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you are the very people saying about glass houses.
A girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to subtract sound drum and bass, as it was 3 a.m., and her morning exam.
In response, the neighbor has increased the volume.
When he finally stopped at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep two hours, and then Vrubel their music and locked the door behind him, having gone to a three-hour exam.
It was not romantic, if your future spouse lived in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, it would not be this extraordinarily until cusany cubits, awkward, if you took the neighbor for his future wife, was keen on them, broke relations and would have to see him every day, and perhaps to watch as he peretyagivaet on its side all your friends in common?
Of course, the heart is not prices - but if hot neighbor does not exactly your future spouse, try a slightly cool their fervor.
In the thrilling moment when you realise that someone had left the keys inside a locked room, the line between drawing and Travles thinner than it seems.
A good draw is fun, but turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Prepoday valuable and interesting lesson for safety, hiding something - but never Packy chunibudg room of toothpaste and shampoo.
Someone else's door lock and put keys in a glass of water, which you then Povich in the freezer - but not other things Blu-Tack pricleivay glue to the ceiling more than two times.
IOS 7: how to install the new operating system on the iPhone after Apple updates
The new operating system can be requested in the application settings, select General and then software update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have faced problems after installation, when you receive an error message that says that "renewal application failed."
To avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait until it subsides, or try to upgrade via iTunes.
Tips on your phone will let you go through the whole process through to the end.
The process may include removal of applications to increase free space - but Apple minimize the probability of this action, reducing the size of the update, and also has simplified the execution with the help of special tools, which offers to remove and reinstall them after completing the application process.
We should make sure that when upgrading your phone charged or is located next to the charger to prevent the discharge of the battery.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop updating, because your phone in the process can lead to a crash.

Washington responded to the Russian military activity by phone.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support that Moscow supports President Assad, only escalate the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about it with Russian counterpart, says PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry telephoned Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, to discuss the Russian military activity in Syria.
According to PJ Media publication.
"Secretary Kerry made clear that further support President Assad by Russia creates the risk of escalation and extension of the conflict, as well as the negative impact on our shared goal of combating extremism," if we also continue to focus on looking for ways to resolve the Syrian conflict by the immediate transfer of power, "the U.S. State Department officials said.
They also noted that Kerry once again emphasized the U.S. commitment to combat the "Islamic State" as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be able to be a part of it.
In addition, the United States "will welcome the constructive role of Russia in an effort to counter the" Islamic state. ""
Last Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what actions taken by Russian troops in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, White House spokesman Josh Ernest said that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet: "when the president decides that the telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he would lift the phone and will try to make this call."
Barack Obama considers himself Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime's "unwinnable."
I remember our conversation with Mr Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that this is a mistake that further support Assad only worsen the situation.
"but he has not listened to my warnings - and as a result the situation worsened," said the US president.
Imported yachts will be released from the payment of customs duties.
The ministry intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other craft for recreation and sport from payment of customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes in the list of subsidized goods for temporary duty-free import on behalf of the government of the Russian Federation were prepared by the ministry.
About this, "" said assistant Economic Development Minister Elena Laskin.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at the end of the trip to Crimea instructed a number of agencies -- the Ministry of Economic Development, Mintrans RF, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Emergency Situations, the FSB, TCF, Rosturism - to prepare proposals for the creation of favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts say that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, maintenance and upkeep.
The owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - about â¬200 million in the coffers of European states annually for maintenance, repair and maintenance.
Russia's economic development ministry has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "on amending the list of goods, temporarily imported with full exemption from payment of customs duties, taxes," providing full conditional exemption from the customs duties and taxes in respect of imported yachts and other floating facilities for recreation and sports.
According to the ministry, it certainly will facilitate the creation of favorable conditions for the development of sailing in the coastal areas of the country, "said Laskin.
The issue was presented to the subcommittee on tamojennotariffnomu, netariffnomu regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of the government commission on economic development and integration, the meeting which took place in September, and on the results of the discussion was also approved by the authorities.
As noted by a representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure for the full conditional release on importation is inherently exemption.
Therefore, after the approval of the protocol of the meeting in the Russian Federation government will make a proposal in the Eurasian Economic Commission Ministry to discuss with Member States EAES, Laskin explained.
In the list of imported goods which are entirely exempt from payment of customs duties, taxes, includes goods needed to facilitate foreign trade and international cooperation, for use in the field of science, culture, film, sport and tourism, to provide international aid, and others - among them service equipment (personal computers, writing machines) and measuring devices, The chisel equipment, stage costumes and scenery, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skiing, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious ceremonies.
The press service of the Russian transport ministry told Izvestia that prepared the mandatory regulations on sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosiya and Evpatoria, which provide a simplified procedure of call and the organizations, the sport of sailing and pleasure boats in the sea port.
Transport given instructions to ensure the use of simplified hemlsmen sea ports of call organizations, the sport of sailing and pleasure boats in the sea port and the release of these vessels from the sea port.
The ministry also prepared projects government orders approving the boundaries of the sea ports of the Crimea.
In respect of Yalta and Feodosia orders already taken, the rest are in the negotiation stage, "noted the press service.
According to the ministry, gosnadzor, classification and examination, the committees in respect of the vessels used for non-commercial purposes, should implement the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of poor infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, then there is a constantly growing industry, in which there is a large number of people.
In Russia, as virtually all is in place.
Our coast malointeresnoe, the only piece where you can operate all year round, is the Black Sea in the region of Sochi, Gelendzhik and Novorossiysk and Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that in this area is extremely strict rules border service: in order to go for a walk on a yacht, you need to get a lot of approvals.
In addition, there's even a pit-stop yacht inside Russia.
Two days, she can go with their fuel, and then there is the problem of where to take it, "says the company's sales director Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
As for the seats for the storage of yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special hangars for yachts of up to 30 metres yacht also send deposited in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov said that buyers of yachts - rich people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts dropped.
The World Bank allocated Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank has approved a new debt project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
Deputy chief of the international organization.
"the new funding will support a number of priority measures to carry out reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the report said.
The World Bank director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Timeo fan said that the banking sector reform will help revive lending in the real economy and will encourage the restoration of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank are experiencing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems fan calls on the Ukrainian government to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved a loan of â¬100 million in Ukraine, RIA Novosti "reports."
Asked to create separate blocks for transgender people in prisons.
The Public Council at the Federal Penitentiary Service (prison) to protect the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues will discuss the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestite in the colonies.
About it, "" said council member Vladislav mushroom.
In his opinion, depending on the total number of prisoners in Russia, undecided with Paul, in domestic prisons may provide separate chambers, blocks or even (if such criminals will be a lot) to create a special colony for transgender people in the long run.
But Vladislav mushroom stresses that determine the punishment of citizens in such isolated places departure is possible only after the medical examination will be convicted, which prove that the offender is really a man, identifying himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav mushroom is confident that the marginalization of transgenders from other prisoners serving sentences will provide security.
According to him, the proposed practice has been successfully working abroad: in jail (where defendants are before the court decision) there are separate chambers for transgender people, and in correctional facilities - special units.
Today it is the only way to work with such criminals.
Definitely need to isolate them, as the presence of transvestites and transgender people in normal cells is dangerous for them, it is a suffering for their families and a sea of problems for the prison staff.
Humiliation by Trans Sonic is assured, "says Vladislav mushroom.
Depending on how big a city, how many criminals with undetermined sex, need and expect, where to allocate them.
The individual is not exactly needed only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there is a lot of transgender people.
As mushroom explained, in the block may contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps will be created in Russia alone, then act on departure punishment will go from all regions of transgender inmates.
Citizens are kept in jail at the place of the crime, so revenues transvestite or transgender people from other subjects in the course of the investigation and trial are unrealistic, but to introduce such practices for already convicted in a separate colony - yes, "said mushroom.
As a reminder, on the eve of the law enforcement personnel were not able to solve the detention centre - male or female - to determine who was detained for drug possession 24-Ð»ÐµÑÐ½ÐµÐ³Ð¾ transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known under the name of Alina Davis), a man with a maiden appearance was not arrested.
He was released under his own home.
The news was widely discussed on social networks and media, as well as the content of transgender people in the mechanism and colonies in Russia does not yet.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolay Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for sentence transgenders, noting that abroad also may have a people - male or female in the colony - depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as well as the issue of providing security in prisons for homosexuals, "says Alekseev.
Prisons should be safe, which is why separate units could have been made in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially as them in prisons, more than transgender people.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubts that Russia will be many people willing to transexuals in order to get into different from ordinary colony.
Of course, you can enter a medical examination before placing people in the colony for transgender people, but it is not always clear.
For example, in the United States, one of the inmates Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and already in jail, said he wants to change the floor, "said Alexeyev.
A man can feel anyone.
But while individual places for a sentence for transgender people, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the security of these people and understand the subtleties of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation, Boris studied under G. Lordkipanidze pointed out that the introduction of the new distribution system in the colony could greatly delay transsexualovprestupnikov beginning sentence convicts.
The commission is created is a question of sexuality, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, this is not a test, on the basis of which is done precision-guided conclusion.
The possibilities of psychiatry today.
However, before the change of gender potential patients are always such expertise - they certainly show whether sex change surgery with the necessary measure, studied under G. Lordkipanidze said.
But it is hard for me to imagine how this system implemented in relation to the convicts, because this survey goes a month on average.
The doctor, despite the fact that the whole idea of a separate blocks for transgender people supported, also doubts that, in the current economic circumstances will make sense to allocate funds to build new premises, medical examination, "transgender people in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, no official statistics, but if you take into account that homosexuals in Russia about 5%, then we can say that transgender people even less, and those who have such a swing and still and commit crimes, even in small numbers, studied under G. Lordkipanidze said.
Now, at the request of the administration of the colony to gay, transgender and so can get separate conditions.
Michael Antipov probably won the World Chess Championship.
The Chess World Championship in Khanty-Mansiysk Junior up to 20 years.
Ending the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was decided only in the last round, and he became Russian Mikhail Antipov, still overtake pole yanakshishtofa Dudu, who seems to be confidently walked to the title.
Ukrainian chess player Natalia Bucs celebrated victory in the girls.
Chess world championship, held in early September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already by the middle of the tournament, it seemed, has lost almost all the intrigue, as a representative of Poland yankshishtof Fife, issued a series of four victories (competitions are held in the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently took the lead.
Given that Fife was reytingfavoritom championship, and is considered to be one of the most promising young players, the likelihood that he misses gained gap was very small.
And even when Fife is playing worse momentum and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov gap to just 0.5 points, he remained the clear favorite in the fight for the title.
In fact Antipov to catch up with the leader, it was necessary to win in the 13th round.
But even this has not helped to win his party in Fife.
Plus this obligation of victory, of course, could affect the game of Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for his party's Fife, vstrechavshiysya Binyamin sideways.
Fortunately for the Polish chess player brought confrontation with a residence in a tie.
Thus, Antipov and Fife scored an equal number of points - 10 of 13 possible, but additional indicators were the best residence.
But because it was his leadership of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, whose Governor Natalya Komarova, traditionally pays much attention to the development of chess in the region, handed the top prize.
But in competitions girls intriguing ending has not happened.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Bucs (Ukraine) - to win the title was not enough to lose in the last round, which she did with success.
Thus, Russian victory by Alina Bucs Bivol not allowed it to catch up.
Russian athlete remained second with only 0.5 points from the champion.
VimpelCom is changing the regional structure.
The company unites Volga and Ural regions in a larger volzhskouralskiy region, Siberia and the Far East - a region in the east.

In the current year, a study by the Association of Russian managers ÑÐ¾Ð¿-1000 "Russian managers" goes in the 16th time.
As a tool for evaluating the top echelon of Russian managers professional reputation, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers for the year by leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates is made up of the winners of the last year.
The winners of last year asked to confirm their participation as a candidate rating this year and nominate members of its management team.
In addition, each of the original list of candidates included in the offer to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, which it may be advisable to add to the total pool of candidates.

Comfortable rate for Investkredit - 10-13%.
Experts estimate that the market for small and medium business loans in January-April of this year fell by 40%.
What do you estimate the situation today?
After the end of 2014 and early 2015 panic SME lending volumes have declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp rise in interest rates.
Lending by 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
If previously the bank could lay in the increased rate of all its potential problems in the future, from the non-return to nevozvratov, now it is impossible to do: rates and sky-high.
The current level of interest rates on loans for business is a comfort.
For a large part of the investment projects, the current level is unacceptable from the point of view of their recovery.
Rates in 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns on them.
How do you estimate the demand for business loans being met?
After the central bank interest rate, the situation has improved a little lower.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients began to apply for loans much less frequently.
First of all, business does not understand its development prospects and future earnings.
Today, the business has one solution: you need to learn how to work, focusing on today's economic situation in the country and the region.
We need to more closely monitor the current results, to control the movement of funds.
At the same time, in the presence of financial resources is to use new technology to modernize equipment to reduce production costs and energy supplies.
All of this, in the end, allows the company to make the products more competitive and maintain business even in the unstable economic situation.
What are the key market trends and consolidate crediting will influence its development until the end of 2015?
Whether to change interest rates?
Forecast to reduce average rates will largely depend on the policy of the central bank, and now the regulator shows a sequence of declines in key rates.
However, the radical loans for SMEs should not fall.
In the current situation, the problem, first and foremost, is inflation, which makes the necessary high interest rate to get real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even when the central bank rates.
If we talk about the level of delay, the company's traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, the limited cash replenishment in both possibilities and variants of correction of economic behavior, of course, will represent a greater risk for creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is that international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.

The Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant capacity plans with another contractor in Ukraine has not yet given up: back in 2014 in Kiev declared that negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.

FedEx revenues are mixed, the forecast for 2016.
FedEx posted disappointing results of the last quarter, and the giant delivery service has reduced annual profit forecast because of falling demand for freight services and cost growth in its ground transportation unit.
The company also said it plans to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that hire 50,000 temporary employees for the holidays.
Its shares had become cheaper by about 2.5 per cent in a preliminary bid for 45 minutes before the opening of the stock market on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10,84 according to a survey by FactSet.
The decline is forecast despite interest rates rise by an average of 4.9 percent, which will enter into force on January 4, and the growth of fees for ground transportation of heavy and large cargo, which begins in November.
The company said it still expects revenue growth compared to last year due to a reduction in costs, increase in gross revenue and the growth of online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "worked steadily, taking into account the weak, compared with the forecast, economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing and global trade."
Labor hiring plans in the holidays were announced the day after a competitor, UPS, announced that they plan to hire an additional 95,000 employees, roughly as much as took a job in the last year.
For the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than a year earlier.
Earnings per share amounted to 3.81 a dollar, close to an average forecast of $2.44 per share by Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed Zacks expect 12,23 billion dollars.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from recession in the sector of urgent international transportation, which has led to a lack of growth in gross income in its expressperevozok division.
But the boom in online shopping has sharply improved results in FedEx Ground.
In the latest quarter revenue from ground shipping rose by 29 percent, but operating income remained unchanged as a whole because of higher costs for large shipments and self insurance.
Expressperevozok unit received higher income because of higher benchmark rates, while in the freight sector revenue fell due to rising labor costs.
In a preliminary bid for about an hour before the opening of the stock exchange shares of FedEx dropped $3,85 or 2.5 per cent, to $150,15.
They closed Tuesday, falling by 11 per cent in a year and 17 per cent below the record from June 11.
On the expected for several years, meeting leaders of the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week for 27-ÑÑÑÐ¾Ð²ÑÐ¼ table made of Honduran mahogany, deciding, whether it was time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of the ornate rooms for meetings in height two floors above them will be Naviset Naste image of the United States.
This card is a reminder that the Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the country's economic interests above all others.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: to maximize employment and to maintain stable prices here in the United States.
But from the time of the great recession, the federal system leaders recognized that there is a third, Napisan assignment: financial stability.
And this is the third order may prove to be an unknown factor in the nearly sprognozirovannom decision, which will be announced on Thursday, about whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from Pretendent incentive, obespechivaemogo almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show strong growth, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may keep the already cautious leaders of the federal system from adding volatility by raising the federal funds base rate - even just on a quarter of a percentage point.
"it is clear that the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important topic of discussion," said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co, a brokerage company.
"but I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she noted.
There is no consensus about what to do in the Federal Reserve system, which, in itself, provokes the fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted growth of interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect a federal system that will, with a key indicator shows only about the likelihood of rapid ascent 30-Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÐµÐ½ÑÐ½ÑÑ.
This may lead to a fall in the stock market, if the Fed raises rates, provided that those who make decisions, not will cushion the blow to a promise that the next increase will not soon.
The Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday rose to 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599,85.
The rise was driven by expectations that the faces that define the strategy of the federal system, leave the rate this week, "said John Lonski, chief economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"it will be a surprise if the Fed will raise rates at this point in time," he said.
If the Federal Reserve will, "they will have to go far in approving its strategy to keep financial markets in their hands, lest they Panicali."
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets, as it is uncertainties about how the Fed will act.
Only a month ago a federal system, it seems, tended to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making it the first small shag in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that it expects to raise rates this year, despite complaints by liberals that we need more economic progress.
Although the emergence of new jobs has slowed in August, labor market growth has been steady this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, which is the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost to the level which is considered full employment in the federal system.
Wage growth shows signs of accelerating.
And, while inflation continues to be below the central bank's target annual rate of 2%, the federal system has announced that a key reason became a temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices.
"the economy can cope with higher interest rates, and in need of them, taking into account the reduction in the labor market," said Mr. Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devaluing its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell by as much as 16 percent to a record high in May, as investors feared that a slowing Chinese economy could drag on global growth.
The market partly regained its position this month, and the Dow Jones industrial average is now about 10% below the high may value.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve makes difficult calculations of market outrage additional interest rate increase.
"in the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and the news about the weaknesses of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks they would have been tightening the screws on this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher of the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and a former member of the Federal Reserve system.
Now, he predicted that they will have to wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
"there is a big uncertainty in what might be the consequences for the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data after recent developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not a major concern of the federal system, and technically it should not consider when making these decisions.
But the Federal Reserve has become a global financial power.
The impact of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
One suggestion from the then Chairman Ben S. Bernanke only in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "stifle" its monetary expansion, sparked turmoil markets around the world.
In a world where the markets and economies increasingly intertwined with each other, one would expect that the leaders of the Federal Reserve system will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "art rather than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc - the company, which is engaged in global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey laquer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said earlier this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve system have been cases of over-reacting to financial market movements, which, it seems, are not associated with economic principles."
Laquer with influential voting member Federal Open Market Committee who pressed for raising rates, as an example of the solution has teeth.
The financial crisis in Asia has led to a federal system that has reduced its base rate to 0.75% for the three sessions, "despite limited identifiable consequences for growth in the US," said laquer.
One year later, the heads of the federal system canceled this fall.
The Federal Reserve system should be put in the first place only care about stability in times of great crises, such as the market crash in 2008, "said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee for setting interest rates to the Bank of England.
The latest panic and not close to that level, he said.
"you would, of course, do not want to be in a situation where you fear growth rates due to the fact that markets are experiencing shock," said Posen, president of the Institute of World Economy. Peterson.
The law on the Federal Reserve still has a dual mandate and no mention of financial stability, and, as long as it does not change, I don't think they should be ahead of the event.

Unfortunately, it was revealed the negative impact of unhealthy food on the immune system of the child.

He is survived by two children.
This is the second case of death among Australian boxers in the past six months.

Now the AMA recommends not to do this sport, or better, from their point of view, it banned altogether.

The speaker of the Russian State Duma Sergey Naryshkin has called unacceptable imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians.
This is what he said in his speech at the session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar.
We regard this as unacceptable actions as an attack on the values of the parliamentary diplomacy.
"and this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of the political impudence and ignoring the principles of open dialogue," the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin urged OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's give the morality in politics.
Let's give the dialogue and the right to the practice of international communication.
Let's give the humanist ideals of the democratic order.

Ponaslajdalsya victory for a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for Sergey Shubenkov Athleta 24-Ð»ÐµÑÐ½ÐµÐ³Ð¾ from Barnaul.
He managed to get on his 110 metres hurdles to win their distance from the European Team Championship, set several records, and the main thing is to become world champion, and the first in the history of Russian safe sprint.
In addition, the athlete won the final stage of the Diamond League recently, "took the third place.
"new News" asked Shubenkov to share impressions of the past season.
Sergei, the season is not over for you?
Yes, I am going to speak at the World Military Games, which will be held October in Korea, and then I will think about the rest.
However, I will now prepare for the House, in Barnaul, and be at home - this is yet another condition.
Everything is easier than Mott each week around the world.
You once said that autumn is the favourite time of year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a great time.
After starting the season otkipeli passions, the burden of responsibility is not pressing.
You can compete in a fun, rasslabone "."
Plus you know and leave very soon...
And there is fatigue?
After all, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions.
Tired by the end of the season is always accumulates.
And here it is not important that I did more - won or lost.
Every competition is stressful.
Frequent flights, transfers - all this is for the body.
You get tired, physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
Yes, I'm just happy to be there!
When finishi at the World Championships in Beijing, return often?
It happens.
And you, journalists, don't give me to forget about it.
But in general I believe that any athlete who lives in old victories, foot over their successful races again and again.
Ponaslajdalsya victory a couple of days - and we have to move on.
Preparation for this wonderful season was very different from the usual?
I cannot say that there was something special.
We started preparations in December, but I missed the competitive winter season.
Training at home in Barnaul, then at the training camp, then back at home.
Everything is as usual.
But with the coach got the goal: to try to reach a new level on which I was not yet.
Almost all of the winter spent to lay the base.
A bunch of told Begali, made by obgefizic training exercises, which included and cravings, and priced and we prokachali back.
Then went all over the barrier, many engaged in technology.
How are rivals monitored?
I always try to do that, in the Internet age there is no problem with that.
Looked at the European Championship, and there in the sprints barrier pedestal occupied the French!
Another thought: you have to do something, to dilute this company.
With every start this season you pribavlali and pribavlali in the results.
Give it confidence?
I have all the past seasons are in about the same scheme.
There is no such that I run 13,20 first and then - 13.50.
Always crucia its shape gradually.
The main thing that you want to do is run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was aimed primarily at this result.
But the paradox is that kind of feeling that is ready for feats, but at competitions to show their readiness is not always.
As it was, for example, at the Olympics in London?
I am, to be honest, the semi-final race (Shubenkov could not done in the final. "neither") tried to forget.
Gott was very good, he could really run out of 13 seconds.
Yes, even if repeated his best result at the time would have been the bronze prize-winner of the games.
But no luck.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
But how?
It was at Taegu.
I really wanted to climb into the finals at the time, was a long-term goal.
And otvalilsya directly from Utra, in the preliminary.
And then realized that tear and headlong rush - so do not run back.
Two years later, at the World Championships in Moscow has already reached the final with the best time.
Remember well their feelings before decisive Sabeg: very much like already to win gold. "
How to manage, develop decent speed, not lose another and head, not disconnect?
But this is the most difficult.
We need to be very careful, focused on technology, not to knock down barriers.
Noticed that when you set yourself up is not the result, but the process is so much easier.
But the most buzz, when you have the feeling that everything happens as if by itself and you!
Honestly, it is worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depths after the first serious successes are trying to move closer to the capital.
Never had such thoughts?
The House is still better.
Yes, and have no idea where I am without my coach who I need?
Can, and it would be good to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
C Klevtsov you are together for a long time?
Since the age of 12, since light athletics came in.
To be precise, at first I began training his wife who worked with children, and then she gave me.
I started with Sprint, then long jumping and triple.
Children's all-around was is when hurl the ball, jump in length from the place...
At 14 I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
With the first race turned out to perform a second adult norm.
And so it has remained.
Fear of the barriers never happened?
Somehow managed to agree with them immediately.
But the technique has always had to work very much.
Won over one "how much was suffering!
But there is nowhere to run from this routine.
Equipment should be rounding out constantly - to me I could wake up at night, I immediately got up and ran through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing, argued that it was a very nice run.
Thank you.
And I liked it.
I usually do when I go through his races, but I could not help.
But we need to continue to work on efficiency - there is no limit to perfection.
Are not afraid now that the victory of the year before the Olympic Games will fall on the shoulders of the heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, will try to justify expectations.
Once chose this road, it should go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you're not Slabach, should not feel any additional cargo.
And I absolutely agree with him in this.
Kushanashvili flocks
Well, I am not so naive to me in amazement the response to the interview, what happened in Ukraine.
Enraged by their own people, I understand that their bread did not feed - Dai, podbrosi enemy.
And although I don't obmatyvalsya flag, and the same, exactly the same, a million times here, and nobody called ubludkom directly - me more angry.
All my psevdodruzya Vig, a second somewhere.
Pressure, which I places me, is so strong that even I, Jugha lad, I think people Belen obelis.
If he was going to go, and you were attacked by a crowd and well mutuse rods.
But you should know me, I am not the Eagle, my fist, I'm from howitzers Vdara, old me, guys, be afraid.
No support is another matter.
And so I have no illusions, but now...
The best in me has always been self-sufficiency, so Cusite.
And give passport Uroda such as Fred Durst or Monson, can only morons.
Better for me, the better journalist, nested work.
A week ago in Kiev Kushanashvili flocks astringently characterized the Crimean events:
What made the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is called the annexation.
I think that the reference to how podvypivshiy Khrushchev was trying to sign something, in no event fits into the overall picture of human life.
This is how to come to a neighbor and pick up his house...
The war has gone from the Kremlin, and it only ends there.
I almost 100% sure that, as in the summer of 2008, it began with a call from the Kremlin's Stenka bastard.
I mean, it could be...
Kobzon not too much left to live.
I do not understand, he is the greatest artist, why he needs to lick the hands of Putin.
He said that the apartment would lose?
Well, destroyed the monument to him.
Of course, people will remember him, after all, as their small homeland oskorblyauschego.
And reconciliation is now only from Vladimir Vladimirovich.

Four were killed when the police opened fire rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year boy, were killed in the south of Nepal, when the police started shooting rubber bullets into the crowd, protesting against the proposed new constitution, a spokesman said on Wednesday.
The violence happened Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
Dakal Bishnu Prasad, the head of the district police, said that more than 1,000 protesters gathered at one of the police offices, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal reported that police used tear gas, then fired into the air before the rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets, which, as you know, you can kill, but they have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, caused such a high mortality rate.
This clash was the last few weeks of violent protests in the south, the flat part of Nepal, where the Madeshi representatives say that the new province, formed under a new constitution that would reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in the west of Nepal, among citizens of the Tara, who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into a province that has become a critical step on the road to a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which centrally ruled for several centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been brewing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake, which has cost the lives of thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted for the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that the new chapter will be signed on Sunday.
San plans to create 900 jobs at the company.
San is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
He was in the 70-s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, has a well-developed infrastructure that requires support system.
A year ago, led by a new mayor - Oleg Sayansk Borovsky.
On the results of the first year of work on new projects and prospects, he told the "regional."

Now the road works on two areas are already underway.
How the city runs RF Presidential Decree on construction of kindergartens?
In July of this year in Sayansk 105 babies were born.
There was no such positive demographics in the city for the past 27 years.
So the question of the availability of places in kindergartens today is one of the most pressing.
On September 1, was closed for repairs Kindergarten No. 10, calculated at 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million rubles.
Such funds, the city still has not received.
Last year after the repair opened a kindergarten No. 23, which is now visited by 200 children.
The repair was made on condition of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost was more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and help regional governments were conceived on the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the program has helped the "people's initiative."
There are plans to start the construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With his input, we plan to eliminate the order of children between the ages of one and a half to three years.
Queues for children between three and seven years, we have not.
Investors are showing interest in the area?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be, first and foremost, say enterprise, it is their need to work.
In October the 60-ÐºÐ²Ð°ÑÑÐ¸ÑÐ½ÑÐ¹ home for orphans in Leningrad.
As for the construction, then I would add that San is one of the four cities in the Angara Region, which entered the building housing program.
All the necessary documentation has been prepared.
90 block-sections construction will begin in the near future.
We just announced construction of 10 thousand square meters of housing those who wish to participate in the program.
One of the conditions of housing should not be more expensive - 30 thousand rubles per one square meter, this price includes finishing "turnkey."
If we cope with the specified amounts, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
In his time in the territory was say svinokompleks, who in 2004 was sold for a pittance.
We are working with the prosecutors on the appeal of this transaction.
The land under the object - in federal ownership.
Is working with Moscow, decided the issue of transfer of 88 hectares in the regional property, with the subsequent transfer of land in the municipality.
There is a potential investor, ready to invest in reconstruction and the launch of 1.5 billion rubles.
With svinokompleksa we have 900 jobs will emerge that will be of great help for the city.
Institute of Social Partnership in Sayansk developed?
We have about 140 social and economic partnership agreements have been concluded.
A great number of projects managed to implement due to active social position of business representatives.
Tangible support such enterprises as JSC "vostokcentr," novoziminska CHP, "say shredded," "PC MDF," responds to all of these enterprises.
Directly to the city of LLC "say shredded" presented to city children's town, "vostokcentr" carried out repairs equestrian yard, where specialists are working with children ipatherapiey, cost it more than 1 million rubles.
The city registry office sponsor funds managed to improve the area.
Sponsors have helped the mark city day.

Also take part in the work of the city's charitable foundation sponsors.
The first step was to buy instruments for young talented musicians.
For the first nine months of more than 800 thousand rubles to support talented children, to help children who need expensive treatment, support for children from low-income families.
How are solved in Sayansk personnel problems in the social sphere?
In the city there are not enough doctors and pedagogovpredmetnikov.
To address the issue of great importance is the provision of housing to HR professionals.
Over the past year, we have identified five apartments for doctors, the service received four teachers.
We have a selection of housing program works with the ability to privatize it in five years.
In the plans is redecorating the building, which will be built in eight apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the program "housing for Russian families."
In the long term, the construction of homes for public sector workers.
The most important thing is that the city has efficient team with which I can solve the most complex issues.
It is important to make the right conclusions from all the crises, and life is not going to stop.
The potential of our region and the route.

With obesity surgery may help obese diabetics on
A salutary effect after obesity surgery in people with obesity, type 2 diabetes, could last for at least five years, according to a new study.
Now, however, it is still too early to say that diabetics with a little overweight live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive nehirurgiceskoe treatment.
"mortality statistics is not immediately," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the column editor of JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the sense of hunger and limit the ability of organisam to metabolize food.
For several years bariatric surgery proved effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the main studies were conducted among people with morbidly obese, having a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal if from 18.5 to 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or above suggests that a person is overweight, and those with a BMI above 30 are people with obesity.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected from 2007, for comparison of two types for bariatric surgery - gastric bypass grafting and sock gastrectomy, with medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with low obesity.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery, fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, the BMI of those who received nehirurgiceskoe treatment for diabetes, remains at around 29.
Among those who underwent the surgery, he was entirely from diabetes, 36%, and partly - 28%.
In the group of patients prescribed medication, by comparison, complete cure diabetes was only 1%, and partial - only about 2 per cent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," say the authors.
The researchers also monitored the Ð°1Ñ hemoglobin levels in the blood, which reflects blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1C test better hold below 7%, "the researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1C test decreased by approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
In a therapeutic group, however, he remained stable at around 8%.
But the best indicators of glycemic control, but with good levels of hemoglobin A1C test does not reduce mortality rates in five years, according to research by Dr. Chicheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, in comparison with the group, polchivshei rukavnuu gastrectomy, the group lost more weight (18.7 kg against heart bypass 14.2 kg), has achieved greater reduction in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin introduction haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c 3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was also closer to full remission of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not show the benefits of surgical technique in terms of life expectancy after five years, there are research confirm people with excess body weight in Sweden that surgical treatment really leads to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone in Phoenix from College of Medicine, University of Arizona.
According to the Swedish study for people with obesity, have chosen bariatric intervention, the likelihood of dying for 15 years was about 29% lower compared to the group that used more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study found no increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this reassuring people with a BMI less than 35 interested in such a procedure.
"this report is very important, because it argues that this surgery is safe in a group with a low BMI, where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors must begin to get serious about weight, as soon as a patient's BMI falls into the range between 27 to 30.
"I think we are waiting too long to get people to take it seriously," she said.
It seems to me that as soon as they accumulate genetic changes that are in their bodies, obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse.
In the mid 1950's robbers learned from the House of fur and 9 million rubles.
In the mid 1950's robbers attacked the residents of Moscow at home and stole their 9 million rubles and three female fur coats.
It informs Interfax with a reference to the press-service of Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unidentified men entered the house through an open front door, located on Gorky Street, tied 20-year mistress and son, threatening both with a knife, kidnapped 9 million rubles, and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the total damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, opened a criminal case on the article "banditry."
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 of the Hotel St. Petersburg have the right to place the tourists who come to see the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to get the necessary permission yet.
According to experts, this is a very worrying sign.
In the run-up to the authorities urgently need to invent the world championship, as all the guests of the city plans.
The two sides "Rosbalt" believe that, due to the cost of renting a removable apartments will grow by tournament 10-30%, and after the championship for removable housing would have to overpay.
The World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the Russian state.
According to the law, written specifically for primacy, each hotel St. Petersburg should undergo the procedure of classification and prove that corresponds to the expected number of stars and the level of service.
Now, it is clear that not everyone is able to do this: hoteliers are so wary of inspections that are often not even requests submitted documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service in St Petersburg.
As President Vladimir Putin told Vadim or other forbidden substances, the agency study 138 hotels and now plans to get 34 cases in respect of hotels, many of which are simply not antimonopolschikam responded.
There are signs that the leadership of the three dozen companies have deluded citizens, placing the number of stars in advertising, or other forbidden substances.
The problem is that now literally every room, no one can lose before 2018.
Officials suspect that during a football championship fans will take all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now the tourists can expect 30.5 thousand numbers.
According to Smolny, 17 five-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotel, 100 - two- and three-star, 550 - odnozvezdochnyh.
According to the first deputy of the Committee on Tourism Development was organized Guichi, currently only 23 hotels - so many checks were classification were accredited in St. Petersburg.
And ordered a similar procedure at Hotel regional enterprises, MOL by an amazing coincidence is unknown.
The last classification may be more, but no one knows about it.
"the last six months are not very eager to be classification of hotels," is acknowledged, director of the Northwest branch of the Russian Union of Tourism Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season during which hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets, which were not laid down the costs of testing, this procedure may cost the hotel depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
But recently, leaders have intensified and submit applications for the classification of hotels, assured Chad.
Hotels need to catch up to July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay the fine, but will not receive the right to work at the World Championships.
It is already known that depending on the value will be developed a fixed fee per room in the hotel at the time of the tournament.
Formula, which will be calculated the cost to be available next year.
This is done in order to prevent price hikes on 200-300%, as it happens, for example, in the Saint Petersburg economic forum.
Need to have a conscience and prevent rising two to three times, but also hotels need to make money.
"I think growth will be up to 50%," - said the president of the Russian Hotel Association Gennady lamshin.
In turn, Vadim or other forbidden substances is not sure that fixing prices is consistent with the understanding of the market economy.
I do not know how it fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure when justified.
"this is better than the unbridled growth," he said.
It is unclear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
The State Duma deputies introduced the bill, according to which hostels should be banned in homes.
Hope that this law will not be accepted or will not apply to St. Petersburg.
"we will defend the point of view that hostels should be preserved," says Nana Gacy.
However, she said, the owners of hotels in any case should be prepared to strengthen the housing code.
If the Duma did approve the bill, roughly 80% of hostels in St. Petersburg will be closed, and at the moment there are 1,500 rooms in them.
According to the president of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers northwest Leonid Garbar, in St. Petersburg lacks two- and three-star hotels, which are just football fans, but there is a bias toward hotels with four and five stars.
This is similar to the situation when "80-ÑÑÑÑÑÐ½Ð¾Ð¼ VIP 75,000 sitting in the stadium."
This can be corrected just by mini-hotels.
Their possible ban expert believes "idiotism": "it seems to me odd that some people can live in apartments, but visitors can't for some reason."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, I agree that it is wrong.
But if the hotel in which guests come for a short period of time, then why not?
The risk to miss the World Cup and because of its fragmented.
Literally hundreds of small hotels simply do not manage to pass the classification and dig themselves a hole.
By the summer of 2016 book will work all the hotels in the city.
"companies that can carry out this procedure is not so much, so they will abandon the less well-paid orders from mini-hotel, and will choose those who get more money," said Gennady lamshin, adding that in some cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, indicators of inspections at the moment is significantly higher than in St. Petersburg.
The reason for this delay is including the permanent government in perestanovkami block that does not contribute to the harmonious work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels all will not be enough, that will most likely have to pay attention to the regional hotels and holiday homes.
For example the city can mobilize celebrations marking the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg river fleet, guests will stay in cabins.
Besides causing many fans will come to vans, in which it will be possible to spend the night.
"the most important thing is not to set up so many hotels, then they were unoccupied," - I am sure Gennady lamshin.
Also very popular during the football championship will use removable housing.
Likely to create a reserve of removable apartments in the city.
Rental rates will rise by 10-30%.
"from the obvious - the first leaves housing near the stadium," - noted the rental specialist real estate research and development agency Larisa Bragina.
The rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will contribute to the construction of new road junctions and on the outskirts of the city, she said.
One should not forget about the human qualities of citizens.
For instance, Leonid Garber is confident that St. Petersburg was always hospitable city in which people don't just suggest the path, but they can also spend miniexcursiu.
There are also complications.
My dad, in 1970 in the yard met a family of Murmansk - father, mother and two children.
They turned out to have no place to spend the night: hotels was difficult, it is hard to sleep at the station.
"and Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," recalled.
However, he added that such traits in people now - there is no call to his home town is fraught with consequences and scary.
But perhaps in 2018 after the poor decisions of the State Duma, hoteliers and governments will have to recall past mistakes?
Zhirinovsky Amur "merged" region.
With admiration today looked at cloned Zhirinovsky in the State Duma.
He did things when our generation still only have to sell newspapers, and is still in great shape.
The theme of the speech, "a protest against the election results the LDPR in the Amur region."
Not shakes protocols - because nothing; other protocols, except izbircommami signed, the LDPR, apparently, no.
Now he raises the runner-up applicant Ivan Abramova and shouting something like: "here is the winner of the election!"
And with what is coming at Rodnina, and then, after some skirmishes with presidencies, diverts the faction from the hall, VOPA literally "you all fronts with your swindlers and thieves."
The press, of course, gives emphasis not on Abramova, scandal and demarche faction as a consequence of scandal and insults.
Volfovich really beautifully and elegantly Abramov Amur merged together with area.
For the whole country, this is another trick of Zhirinovsky in the style of "such scum!," and not a protest against the election results of specific political party.
And formally poskandalila faction, and elections, according to the party's website and Facebooku Ivan Abramova, not recognized, but obviously SLET leader with themes.
Provides the dead bury their own dead on the Amur river, but blagovestvuet himself against United Russia in general and in no actress required to Rodnina.
Elegant solution to and not to lose face, and in the present, rather than splashy scandal does not go.
Another thing that now finds itself in a strange position and Abramov.
He also reported yelling from bosses for nothing, there is no alternative to the protocols.
He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other, to a narrow circle of it became a formal reason for insulting a respected champion, and that even steeper, Hamas attacks against the EP and of.
And then, of course, we need to think very seriously what to do.
Because of the main beneficiary of elections, policy number 2 and number 1 on the candidate's regional single-mandate district he could turn into a pariah who successfully popolzovalos his own party leadership and party leadership of superrazdrajitela for himself and others.
That's certainly - there would be no Zhirinovsky, he might have come up with and for him to watch.
Trump type still grow and grow before him.
There was the news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the same plenary.
That is why no bath has fallen at all.
The only pogrebla came under the theme.
Really nice.
"it is impossible that all came to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to stop violence in countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Center for Compassion Dalai Lama in Oxford, devoted to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the existing circumstances, the interests of humanity should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while it is admired, the reaction of Western European countries on the refugee crisis is not relevant to the situation.
"this neozmojno to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama said of the actions taken by Germany and Austria highly in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
"caring for thousands of refugees - fine, but at the same time you must think about long-term solutions, as well as to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education in these Muslim countries," he said.
In the end, we need to think about how to reduce the number of killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force will never solve these problems, "he added.
Speaking about violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George W. Bush after the terrorist attacks of 9 / 11, saying that the strong reaction the US launched the chain of events.
After 9 / 11 I expressed his condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is possible through nenasilie.
I know that his intentions were good, but he has used force, and this caused unexpected consequences, "the Dalai Lama said.

Many of the most prityagivangih (disinfectant liquids for hands) - those that aromatized.
There is liquid bleach to arms with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
Disinfecting liquid for hands contains somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol.
Young children, especially, just a few palenia can cause alcoholic poisoning.
"this is a high concentration of alcohol, told Fox 4 in Kansas City," Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician at the hospital of the University of Kansas toxicological Center.
You would not have left with just a glass of whiskey, but people keep referring to these disinfectants for hands, and if children go to them, it is a quick way to consume large amounts of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently in school has swallowed disinfectant for hands with Clubin aroma in the amount of approximately four palenia, was sent for treatment in the emergency department.
Blood alcohol level was 179, two times more than an adult, which by law is considered the intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie - ambulance doctor, who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Poutala Naija words and could not walk when she was rushed to the emergency department.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic, not to miss any signs of brain injury, because due to alcohol girl fell and struck his head, Ritchie said.
"it was very scary," told CNN ortoire Scott, Niji mother.
This could well prove to be fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use spirt substance or disinfectant wipes, in addition, in order to remove the liquid bleach to hand out of the reach of children.
In addition to the alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant liquids associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after he swallowed disinfectant, nezayavlenny contained toxic ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, and not ethyl alcohol, which was specified as the active ingredient.
In January, three in the north of New York agreed uchenikachetveroclassnika poison them "prote" teacher "of antibacterial substances in the classroom," according to a police report.
Teacher had a strong allergy to disinfectors for hands, and it has shut down to keep them in its class.
Police said that the failing plan was "empty talk," and address the issues of discipline school district.
As the oldest child library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the nursery Crae library, when Krupskaya because cast-iron owl.
Kids who come for books, try to feed it candy.
For several generations of walks in this library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the 1920s, the last century there were loud readings, performances on own poetry Mayakovsky, literary quiz and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
Correspondence continued for four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalin wrote in 1939," every day "friendship between hope Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends children's library of Barnaul" grew ever stronger.
Hope Konstantinovna even expelled once their baby photo Barnaul distant friends.
And when Barnaul asked whether hope Konstantinovna objects to the library gave her name, wrote that no, not objects.
Letters long collect dust in the museum, and grandchildren and dissapear first readers have to explain, whose dour profile adorns bas-relief on the building of a library.
During the years of perestroika often called different people were indignant: why children's library is not?
Let there be some good name library of children's writer, without political painting!
The library staff sat down and thought and decided to leave it as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the lobby of the library is a yellow brick.
"Wizard of Emerald City" is a favorite topic of the artist Moskovki Oli.
Previously, she was a manager at a law firm, came to work at eight, went to five, and from all other managers differed only love for drawing.
And then found the Internet advertisement: "I need an illustrator for a book."
The book I wrote a little American girl, and called it "my cancer mommy" - "my mum had cancer."
She did illustrations, and thought: life could end at any moment, and no miracles will not be in it, if you don't create them himself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books writers around the world and composes a fairy tale.
It is traditionally considered that children lose interest in the book that they increasingly live in a virtual space...
But NAMT go read to children and their parents understand the value of reading, "said" Planet "director Tatiana kushvid Russian library.
In recent years, we have even had such a moment of confidence that children's library, and it will live - rebyatishkito go here!
It seems to me that the interest in reading is returned.
In the lobby of the library, a large exhibition stained with updated fotoecspositiei hanging.
Once in a quarter are new photos of readers who go to the library with the whole family: mom, dad and kids.
In the library are happy that children increasingly began to arrive.
If in two years the child read only, then he needs more sophisticated books at a young age.
But now there is a law which is prohibited from issuing books together voslmiletnemu category 12 +.
To get the book, the child should bring the parents - they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes something like a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library - the prerevolutionary collection of legends with ATI and er, lead Korolenko in the annex to the magazine "Niva," podshivka "Murzilka" in 1936.
After all, we are now not only conceptual space "shrine of the book," we are now open to traffic, we tried to become a special place: no home, no work, no school, "says Tatiana kushvid.
We can come together to read, play, draw.
We did play area for kids - the kid comes just play and recato still stretches to the book!
Some of our readers are parents, and they are faced with, do not want to leave.
Often come mothers with strollers - and we are pleased that they put the library in the first place among all the other places where we should go with kids.
Tatiana kushvid says: modern children as much as we used to be, like the classic children's literature:
"publishing now is developing, and a lot of attention is paid to the authors who are the link between generations."
And if we are talking about small children, then it is important that was a hero who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to part with their heroes.
The library routinely releases booklets for parents, which tells what happens in modern children's literature, what books you should pay attention to and why.
Booklets so exciting and intriguing, and adult zainteresovyvayutsya, but this library is not for them.
Impose the books beyond the adult reading room is prohibited.
This magic privilege is only for children.
... in the back room of the library have square Luke with an ancient wood staircase in the basement, in knigohranilige.
Steps will be poskripyvat under your steps are already very old time machine.
With a book of his childhood, as with an old friend: Hi, it is good that we can't change.
Ellie still fun stepping on the road paved yellow brick, like S.J. decided stealing magic matches, and never said a damn malchishkibalchish burjuinam military secrets - that he has a strong word.
Such books are like passwords, you can find them anywhere in their area.
There is a real rarity in the books - for example, the prerevolutionary collection of legends with ATI and era.
Or novellas Korolenko in the famous annex to the magazine "Niva."
Or "Murzilka podshivka" in 1936.
While maintaining the page, raskrasilo them in tea.
These publications are not for readers.
This is the future of the collection, I dream - we retire and will be focusing on rare children's books.
But the children on this is, so to speak, not Pedus: and paint in old books are not very bright, and themes... open the first page, and there is Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now it seems: why do we all have prepared this "pioneer shit they taught the truth?"
But still it was interesting, "says the" Russian world "Galina Ilyasova, head of assessment.
"Murzilka" pages have darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilyevna manages the collection of all his life.
She knows what colour of Buratino cap in the academic year Harry Potter became a team captain on the championship Griffindor Quiddich, Carlson uses for Motorchik silencer in what situations, and whom Selezneva Alice's father works.
For the work of the librarian pay little, and all those who can live without these textbook series, very quickly find another profession.
There are only the most cold-hearted: educators, teachers, the cult of the book.
You can find out more on their smile - it is believed that this is a professional line of children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation is a professional.
I love children's books: as a librarian I like that they were to exactly and beautifully stood on the shelves, and I love to read them, "says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: the military, the historical novel, fairy tales, fiction.
Read contemporary Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, it seems to me, in my childhood, everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that happened to me then.
And since I'm loved them, it seemed to me that the library is a magical place.
And I wanted to work, where everyone is sitting and reading.
I hope that books will always be, despite rider.
And rejoice when our former readers bring their children and grandchildren...

Why I am witness executions in Oklahoma
Today, out-maneuvered legal intervention in the later stage, I will look like a tiny person.
If this happens, and I hope that all the same, I will sit on the viewing gallery camera on death row in prison in Oklahoma, when Richard Glossip will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
For the first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and, though I was power in shock, I agreed.
With the approach of this day I began to be afraid.
So why do it?
I agreed, as I thought that this is a good way to tell the detailed history of the death penalty.
It would have offered a unique aspect.
Yes, journalists are allowed to be present at executions in America, and because people are often more than seats, the results of the grim lottery to decide who will be selected.
The number of seats for the press in Oklahoma reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotion.
I cannot do that.
I will sit with the most close friends Richard Glossip and we have our own relationship with him after several months of phone calls and one visit, had two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when speaking with him.
The prison administration argues that I could not be both a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notepad and a pen to write down what I see.
I will have to try to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter that I postpay impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of a prisoner as he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She acknowledged that she "could better articulate," but still believes that I was wrong in what I do.
Richard Glossip did not agree with some of what I said and wrote.
He never told me what to write, and I would not do it, even if he spoke.
I told him that he can remove me from your list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants the international edition of the journalist was there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that the publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from The Huffington Post, "will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to podcasts, which I recorded.
I will not go into the details again here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of collusion with crime.
But I do believe that there is a high probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was not enough evidence for a death sentence.
I believe that his execution was wrong.
And from this point of view, I will see how he will die.
I cannot say that I am entirely objective.
Will be other reporters, to which you can ask for it.
From me, you will know what it is to look like a man, which I like, die unnecessarily.
Dogged by the police persuaded the man get out of the Canning River
From the town of Canningvale constable managed to talk the man out of the Canning River, and to stay dry.
A resident of Perth intended to escape from the police, but was not able to, anchored in the dirty water in shallow water a few metres away from a police officer, attempting to "gently persuade him to go out on the beach."
Police kanningveyla Tuesday was caused by illegal penetration of Backingham in a foreign territory.
When police spotted the suspect, he tried to walk away from them, scurrying in Canning.
But he swam away.
"he stood in the water and said" I will not go, let's hvatayte me, "said senior sergeant Sandell Caldin.
Constable laclanu perhavetsu not very much like wetting the form, so he used a more secure reception - "negotiations with a good cop."
"sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," said senior sergeant Caldin.
Futbolistchempion Ben Kazin it was memorable.
In 2006, Kazin fell into a ditch to avoid a meeting with police patrol for testing on alcohol, and tried to float son.
His efforts were in vain, but put local residents to invent a comic Kazyna biathlon "Ben."
Peter Moody accuses stewards in trying to espionage and threatens to leave the equestrian sport
Peter Moody has accused Racing Victoria stewards in an attempt to introduce a spy in his stable last year and threatened that he would leave immediately equestrian sport.
His target became the stewards and Racing Victoria integrity department employees, whom he accused in the fact that they have organized a campaign against him personally, and withdrawal from the start lady Tatay due to violations of the rules on the use of drugs on the day of the launch, on Wednesday, was the final straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always exerts all efforts, participating in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation, when we were talking about the positive result Lidari samples on cobalt, which he can't explain.
He was held on suspicion of espionage language for one and a half years old and did not want it to look like "the grapes are."
"I was not going to say anything about this, and endured for a long time, but sometimes you are so upset him that no longer sderjivaeshsya," Moody said.
They know that this went on.
Sometimes reagirueshi, then you must endure the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
I will go home and sleep tonight.
I want to walk with his head held high and I want my owners knew - I do everything for them.
When they begin to think that this is not the case, then I will have to stop being coach.
Then I will have to think about what to do with their license.
Earlier, Moody poll said during an interview on racing.com that ethics department was trying on his stables.
"a year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat down in a room with a man, whom I will call, if you will, and offered him a job in my stable to transmit information about what I do in the stables," said Moody on racing.com.
They clearly believe that I am the fraudster.
If so, all of them, of course, should apply, as I attempt to catch him failed.
Robert Rolston, former chairman of RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of RVL and Bernard Sondra, naneshniy executive director of RVL, knew about it all the time and they know now.
Whether it should not make me think that the matter has become personal?
Should not be whether RVL to muster courage and bring to account for what happens in this business, other people, in addition to the coaches?
Bad I for this profession?
So if I was bad for the profession?
Maybe people think that it is.
Maybe they need to take my license and vytolkaty me away, and I have no doubt - what I say now, may make them think about it.
But I got to the point now where I am still, and it made me sad.
From this really sad to me.
I will put pressure on them and the vozloju responsible for making decisions.
I have a family to support and I can leave.
Inaugural coach only grew during a long investigation case with cobalt and Lidari, and the removal of horses from the start made it clear that he can "hurl your license on the table."
Moody, most famous for the fact that the prepared invincible three-time black caviar, called the requirement to use medical drugs on the day of the competition "ridiculous" after the horse has been compress on his feet of clay, which is a violation of the rules.
This is a violation of the rules of the races.
"I must bear full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly made a compress on her leg.
She could get a compress last night.
She could get it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody may be disqualified for three months in accordance with the rules regarding the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition for using a washcloth over what the stewards opened an investigation.
This is a joke.
The people who create these rules, know nothing about horses.
"we all understand that we need rules, but it went too far," said Moody.
The driver who hit the scene in Cobram skryvshiysya and arrested

"Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy Paret charges rivals in hard hitting
"Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called the criticism of his team as a" ball interception imposing agenda "on the part of two NRL championship favourites.
Sydney coach rosters "Trent Robinson said that the judges have allowed" storm "" fight "with his team during a sudden victory" storm "in the final qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Coach Wayne Bennett Brisbane Broncos "" made clear the implication on the storm after his team won the final qualification tournament "Noser Queensland CAUBOIS" on Saturday night, when he called this game "typical" for rugby league and said that two of the Queensland team were not "too successful" in a hand-to-hand fight.
Bellamy defended intercepting the ball his team and said they were simply focused on "Contact," perehvatyvaya ball.
Bellamy added that he inspired confidence in the criticism of his team from the two leading trainers, because it means that they are worried about a possible loss from the storm. "
"it continues to pop up - I haven't heard that Trent Robinson talked about hard is when they beat us with a score of 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we didn't change the whole year in their systems or techniques of protection, just over the last six weeks we paid special attention to the contact, the ball, and it was a turning point for us.
Trent there for three years and he obviously trains an excellent team, so he is probably not used to play, and for him it was a shock.
It is ironic, as it always is at this time of year.
Bellamy posporil Bennett with the idea about "spectacular football," reminding his teacher that "sentjorjillavarra Dragons" Bennett won in the championship in 2010, showing the "boring" football.
Wayne says about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game Saturday night with our Friday evening, and see how impressive was their game, "Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010. "" a lot of cheerleader who had criticized as boring team, but Wayne said that he does not care about it.
But now he has a team that can display what he considers an impressive football, especially their young midfielders with their speed.
This is football, in which you'd want to play when you have such players.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants to play football in all in his style - not each team has two midfielder such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they could play so well.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things, because they are worried about a game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably did not think about us when we got to the big game.
Bellamy also noted that the game "storm" and "rosters" was a match with a lot of points than a game "Broncos" and "Cubas."
The game "Broncos," probably was good, I haven't seen it, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game he was 20: 18, there were two more attempts - and that, and this is an impressive football?
Or consider the impressive breaks and failed efforts?
It is a routine for me.
If they speak about us, this means that at some point we can meet with them there.
"storm" at the end of this week off as they won the right to host either North Queensland Cubas, "or" KronaL sharks "in next Saturday night at the preliminary final at the stadium ground Park, tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.

Marco Maksimovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on a yacht Solay, repeatedly groping from South America through Vanuatu and prishvartovavsheysya in Cumere in August.
Throughout the morning Maximovitch and his accomplices have seen on the wharf, and later he met with them in a cafe Coomera roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in the car Toyota Echo.
Despite the fact that Maksimovic threatens life imprisonment for attempting to gain the narcotic substances, in sufficient quantity for sale, the lawyer Maximovitch argues that the evidence that the latter trying to recruit the whole party, are missing, and that a man could be in a cafe without any malice.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should let go on bail.
At last, there are ties with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he said in court on Wednesday.
In the course of the criminal proceedings, he lied to police about his location.
Mother and were invited to make a joint pledge in Thim Maximovitch $200,000 for his release.
"from the evidence of both, it becomes clear that the deposit amount $200,000 is too great a financial burden to them," said judge Flanagan.
But this one is not enough to guarantee that he will not go away, the judge added.
Maksimovic was allowed to be freed on bail under the condition that he will turn on how its Australian and Serbian passport will be celebrated in the police daily and abide by a curfew from 6 p.m. until 6 o'clock in the morning.

Yes, I will need some time to restructure the centre position, still in the NBA, I played more forward.
Now will need more to confront a large centre opponent, but I've dealt with it before, so I think, and now alone.
According Euroliga won the last time in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the Final Four six times, "but every time there could not show his best basketball.
There is an opinion that someone sglazil team.
In the game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's hard, I understand the disappointment of the club and all its fans.
But we have a great team right now, and if we show the best that they can, then we have a good chance to win Euroliga, I really think so.
Always wanted to win this title, Muscovites have already been defeated in the tournament, and I think this year will be a year of CSKA.
As for hexes, then I am not superstitious people, and I do not believe in the curse.
I believe in hard work and determination if you connect those two things, then everything is possible.
I have no certain rituals before games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.

In a conversation with Wilshire Wenger also stressed that it was still only September, and that if Wilshire recovery will go according to plan, then there is no reason for him to return to the game for Christmas.
In the best scenario) just to skip at least four the next game in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains an open question.
The offending in this recent problem that confidently finished last season) with only the ankle injury and was going to return to its familiar aggressive style during a pre-season game.
Wenger: "this injury does not threaten his career."
It is simply not up to the end of zajivshaya bone.
Nothing serious.
It is just a coincidence.
It is not associated with lodges or injuries that it has had before.
It may be that things from the medical point of view, but also made Wenger, there's been paired with the risk of additional injury for any player, returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier injuries Ltd, Wilshire recorded 23 different injuries, occurred to him in the six years that have passed since his debut.
In addition, he played in only 65 out of 157 games Arsenal in the league over the past five seasons.
If you look at the alignment for Arsenal, you can see that in six of the eight seasons from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of two Premier League clubs, on account of which most missed due to injury.
Wenger admits the likelihood of stuck in a vicious circle, but in the "arsenal" believe that improved statistics on injury last season will continue.
"sometimes, back in operation after injury, you are vulnerable at for some time - during this time you need to recover and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough and will do.
I hope that he will recover physically, I believe in this, and the fact that his career will be such that he deserves.
Arsenal begins campaign in the Champions League match on Wednesday with DinamoZagreb "" and will continue its Saturday games with Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur in London next Wednesday, with "," and Wenger intends to hold a rotation of composition.
Bellerin involved and Aaron Ramsey came to Croatia, so most likely in Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will play.
It is possible that Wenger also introduces the Kirana Gibbs and Olivier fat and Theo Walcott real Nacho instead.
"I try to maintain balance and give a little breathing space to players who need it," said Wenger.
Although the "arsenal" an absolute favorite in Group F, stadium "Maxim" in Zagreb is among the most dismal in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of the 41 matches since they have managed to spend last season as "invincible."
On Tuesday evening the stadium was exposed to an earthquake of 3.4 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal has learned the lesson last season, when the team lost in the Champions League game against Monaco, and remains with a weak hope lead club to victory in the final of the Champions Cup.
"this is an incredible drive," "said Wenger.
Arsenal have never done before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
Friendsfest: while the show, which prepodalo us serious lessons of male friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially given how desperate is the need of men in candor, now more than ever, with the suicide rate among young men is the maximum for 15 years.
In 2013, it has become the biggest cause of death of men aged between 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom, and with men is three times more often than women.
In an attempt to deal with the problem of "campaign against the miserable life" announced 2015 year of men in order to challenge a culture that does not allow men to ask for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this struggle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression, found that if a patient has a fairly large number of friends "in a normal mood," the chances of cure.
Similarly to those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends twice reduces chance of mental illness.
But, of course, that friendship was, first of all, that was it.
In an era when communications are managed by social networks, when style prefer content, speed of response is often valued more than a meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need appear strong, loving fun and successful, even if the reality is loneliness.
Such a superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely due to internal values, of our inner desire for personal growth and friendship that stronger influence on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently observed, the creator of video games, the money actually does not buy more happiness.
The dignity of friends is that they attract attention to it.
Each of the characters was defined not by his work, but rather through personality, which has manifested itself in communication with friends.
Humor and constant hugs Chandler's daughter, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross and Rachel vozdyhania - everything comes from understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from complete study of their feelings.
As an employee told me "Samaritans":... "my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal moods, underscores how even a small fellowship of friends can benefit."
Often the men who come to us feel unable to talk with friends.
The old "live with it" strongly Slavonic-Bulgarian History, as well as a sense that open talk about problems can be viewed as a weakness. "
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer a more enduring work coping mechanisms.
It highlighted malozametnye moments of male friendship.
As for my goals, outsider status, Beseder by phone, helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from the middle of the circle as well as family and friends.
So, if you visit friendsfest in Comedy Central this weekend, where fully restored for holiday decorations, why not take your friends to drink in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see a man in Starbucks, smile and say "hi."
In advance not to guess what benefits can bring friendship.
Friends show on Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 episodes, Taegu # FriendsFest

Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes later, after his first game in the Champions League as a player, "PSG," to set the direction of the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increased their advantage when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with the "real Madrid" and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, "bet" was necessary to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, because they're not on the qualification playoffs, and the continuation of a series of successful games in the past three seasons, where they reach its quarter.
They have earned points, but at the same time, it was not the best solution for Ukraine has counted Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in attack and later to replace him on the field in a game against the team from his hometown and the club in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.

This is promising.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I regret that we have not scored on one or two goals more.
This was back after injury in one of the team's substitutions in Paris that brought her a draw with the account 2: 2 in a match against Bordeaux in the first League of the weekend, but it lay on the back burner Di Maria in the fourth minute.
Argentine striker noted as a player capable of bringing "PSG" to a new level in Europe, after his last month wykupili "Manchester United," and he showed why, when he ran on a pass from Marco Verratti behind the protection of MalmÃ¶ "" and beautifully finished the attack, sending the ball past Johan Willand in the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone was expecting from "Paris St Germain" light and then a great victory, they had to be disappointed.
"MalmÃ¶," which won Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, with the nine world-class players on the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of strike Nikola Djurdjic, where the ball flew past the back of Kevin Trapp "opposite classmate Mare on the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
But PSG "" at times just himself resultative gears and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, which is only in the first half could not implement at least five attempts, and then couldn't handle the ball, clubbed Cavani immediately after the resumption of play.
Nevertheless, he showed himself far more skillful in the exact pass, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, after which, Di Maria sent the ball a peculiar appearance becomes a blow that has passed that went close to the bar by W. Wieland on 52 minutes.
The second goal finally was scored attacks after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, Uruguay's scored his sixth ball of the season after, after this pravil ball, sent to the center of the field from the left flank Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that were "relatively MalmÃ¶" return to the game, and only intercept the ball from close range prevented Viland David Luiz to raise the final bill before released by replacing secel Lavessi goal had not been counted in the end of the match.
Coach Malmo "" Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were class above his team, while the Norwegian said: "our last game in the Champions League was held in December last year."
Since then we have played only in the Swedish league, but it is not the level.
Skills are not enough.
"glory!
That was a great match with them.

Lead the economy - Nobel laureate: globalization
Print out the processes of globalization were supposed to reduce inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, the difference in income of the population in emerging economies, by contrast, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To fix this, we need to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, said chief researcher at the international laboratory for analysis and selection decisions of the HSE, the Nobel laureate in economics, 2007 Eric Maskin.
In the past twenty years, the world has experienced an unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization have predicted big gains for emerging economies.
"and these predictions have come true in many ways," stresses Maskin.
For example, China and India have received a serious per capita GDP growth.
But not all the way.
It was expected that globalization will reduce the gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" in poor countries, which is manifested in the large income inequality, or more precisely - wages.
But in fact it is only increased inequality, said Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies," published in the World Bank economic review, which translated and quoted Nye.
In conjunction with the economist, a Harvard University professor Michael Eric Maskin Kremer developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the difference in income increases in poor countries as globalization, A.S.M. Nye recalls.
On a new global market specific processes occur.
To demonstrate, main highlights four levels of training of specialists - A and B for the rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization D professionals from poor countries lack the skill level to cooperate with a and B from rich countries.
And if the level of workers from poor countries with wages growing through the cooperation with B of the rich, workers do not feel their salaries d growth or even fall.
The final effect is such that the internationalization of production will contribute to the increase in the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and raise the level of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin offered surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It helps to explain why globalization has led to the income inequality, "said Fuad Aleskerov informed that ordinary professor, head of the international laboratory analysis and selection decisions, head of the Department of Mathematics of the HSE.
And like any powerful theory, I am confident that it will lead to an explosion of empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the employees themselves, as a scientist, does not have the means to do so, and pay for their education unprofitable companies.
Can play a significant role in this situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds, Maskin believes.
The scientist notes that developed the theory in no way calls for a halt of the globalization process, which brought and bearing fruit in the form of GDP growth.

In the capital are experiencing a new form of training.
Four hundred students studied the role of airport staff.
The three aviagavaney Domodedovo assembled for this model.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also served the planes.

The U.S. Embassy regrets about the closing of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia has expressed its regret in connection with the closure of the Foreign Literature Library in concert at the American Center.
The center has worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the U.S. embassy American Center at State Library Ð¼.Ð¸.ÑÑÐ´Ð¾Ð¼Ð¸Ð½Ð¾ in Moscow.
"unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times, questioning the government's commitment to Russia relations between Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted, even during the Cold War and in other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries," U.S. Ambassador John F. Tefft said in a statement, according to Interfax. "
American Center created deep and strong connections between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
He was a center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American personalities, among whom were astronauts, actors, athletes, politicians, scientists and writers.
"just last year, American center spent more than 400 cultural and educational events and took more than 50 thousand Russian visitors," the diplomat said.
Be recalled that about a year ago the decision was made to close another joint Russian-American project - a program of student exchanges Future Leaders Exchange Program (FLEX).
The green tribunal was swift to reprisals.
A typical situation: four officials facing the judges table Swatanter Kumar, showered his claims to the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We have not provided for you 110-ÑÑÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐ½ÑÐ¹ ordered you to poteshalisi over him, "said Kumar.
If it will be put to another brick, we Prikaz demolish all the buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NRT) - the authority of the judiciary, which was established in 2010 to stop the pollution that accompanies rapid economic growth in recent decades.
During that time, the tribunal had to consider more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological developments, toxic waste and construction of dams.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop construction, leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: for nearly 60 years since the announcement of enhanced industrial development of India's independence has evolved from virgin jungle in one of the most densely populated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large cities, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: the city covered with dense smog, rivers filled with pesticides and waste management businesses and households, and the few remaining residential areas are under construction of new residential area.
Despite the formal support of the Green movement by the state, NRT regularly exposed to criticism from Narendra Modi's government, as it often is the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
So, in May of this year, environment minister called the court decision "extreme" and "impossible."
Sometimes it is impossible to truly fulfill the court decision in the court term, confirms the lawyer Raj Panjwani on environmental matters.
But unrealistic term deadlines have a silver lining: at least they make the important move.
"his main goal is peretryasti this system," added the lawyer.
Green tribunal has repeatedly canceled construction: on his account of the construction of the airport, power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
At the same time, people are also not forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of the pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnana, zagryaznyavshei local river have fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are accountable for the economic consequences.
"people will lose their jobs, commented on his decision," Kumar said.
But such explanations are not always find understanding among ordinary people, whose lives can change through one Roscher judicial pen.
In April, the tribunal took a decision to ban all the vehicles older than 10 years of entry into the capital than it has caused outrage.
Despite sharply upavshuu popularity and a flurry of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to cancel the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Delhi government statistics about vjezjangem and vyezjangem vehicle, and also made a proposal buy 10,000 additional buses, previously learned in factories, whether they are able to perform a similar order.
As in the court's attention began to get such sources of pollution, such as landfills, fuel quality and even traffic incidents, people's anger began to abate.
But the most sick theme principled judges became program to clean up the river Ganges, announced with fanfare last year under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
When it comes to the Ganges - a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often ceases to control their emotions and to cry.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Somebody poured water from the Ganges on the statue of the God, and it turned out to be faeces - goryachitsya judge. "
You continue to pollute the river because I think: the Ganges is the Ganges, he will take away all our sins.
This is the river that we worship, and see what you're doing with it every day.
Ganges cleanup is the most ambitious and costly environmental project, anonsirovanm the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in the river exceeds the norm in more than 120 times.
Each year from 1.5 to 3 from 700 million Hindus bathing in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi, even sacrificed in the Ganges rescue fund, the money collected from the sale of his suit, in which he met with Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for 700,000 dollars, while it will take at least eight billion to clean up the river.
Supporters of the green tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but it does not believe that the price of progress must be ecology.
"in a developing country talk about the environment is often perceived as a luxury," says the activist organization "call Bhanot Ganga," Malik said.
And the court tries to find a middle ground between environmental and development. "
