During the call to 911, the teacher admits to killing girlfriend
During the call to 911 voice almost trembling school teacher Shannon lamb told police that he shot his girlfriend and that employees who would have come to their home.
Lamb stressed that the house has a "dog" that is alive, but probably upset, and said contacts of family members of the deceased can be found on her phone.
Inside the house police found the body of Amy Prentiss and the note, scribbled by hand on a white piece of lined paper: "I'm sorry, I'd like to take it all back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," reads the note, according to the authorities, signed by Lambom.
Nothing pointed to the fact that lamb, who led two online course at the University of the state of the Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had the time to go 300 miles to the University campus, where, according to the police, he shot and killed a respected history Professor Ethan Schmidt on the threshold of his office.
The chief of police state University Delta Lynn Buford reported that the University staff found out about the shooting at 10:18 am.
He said that lamb has done the true 911 call shortly after.
By the end of the day the victims will be one more: lamb committed suicide as the police surrounded him.
The next day after the fire at a school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, officials were still trying to combine in one picture the motives that prompted Lamba.
Information shared by the investigators in both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to make the portrait of a talented, but perhaps troubled teachers.
The students were told that they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gautier, killing Prentiss, said that he has no record of allegations of violence or criminal cases.
He and Schmidt have incorporated Lamba in his book, in which he expressed gratitude to the "wonderful people" with whom he crossed paths in his teaching life.
They both taught at the faculty of social Sciences and history, which has 17 teachers and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time there were some background problems.
One student who spoke well of Lambe, Brandon Beevers, said that he seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something wasn't right."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that lamb at the end of the academic year 2014-15 told him about how he struggled with stress.
Lamb previously asked the University of the state of the Delta to provide him sick leave, saying that he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the University rules of employment meant that the degree of doctor, on getting so strongly worked lamb would not guarantee him automatically obtain the position of teacher.
University President William La forge said that he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamba and Schmidt, but "obviously, Mr. Lamba was something on your mind".
These are the questions to which lamb won't be able to answer.
The police attacked the trail Lamba after his escape from campus when he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was able to arrest, lamb was shot from odnoskatnoj of .38 in the backyard, one mile South of his parents ' house in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, said the coroner Washington County Broom Johnson.
His car with the engine running was still standing on the driveway.
Nesrazu it was unclear why the lamb came to the house, although, according to Johnson, she believes that he knew lived in it.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at the University, which is listed 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received the degree of doctor of pedagogical Sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of old friends Lamba described him as smart, charismatic and cheerful man.
Charles Hairston said that she was 15, and Lambo 20 years, when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends went to high school, and he was a cool older guy who for several years tried to teach her how to play guitar.
In those years he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls melted when he was around," says Hairston, who is now 40 and who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss to the time of the events must have met for some time.
During the call to 911 lamb said, "I killed my wife", but the record of registration of their marriage is absent.
The couple had a dog named lightning, who lived with them in Gauthier in a brick house, back facing the canal.
According to police, the dog was all right.
Ex-husband Prentiss, Sean O Steen, reported that they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and they have a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She's devastated," said O Steen about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O Steen said he did not meet with Lambom, but he had heard from his daughter Abigail, what lamb was interested in music and played the Blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss, when he and Abigail were both appearing on the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O Steen told that his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked in a variety of online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time coordinator of entertainment programs in the dimly lit bar, The Julep Room in the suburb Gautier, said that the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss in the evening of 5 September, when the lamb has finished playing the guitar and harmonica for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
"Just a happy couple", he said.
We had fun and played pranks on each other.
In the sense that they were both very witty.
Schmidt, killed the teacher, conducted seminars for first-year students and specialized in the history of native Americans and colonial America, told by don Allan Mitchell, associate Professor of English at the same institution.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was President of my fraternity and student government.
In the University campus of Delta state in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including University faculty, staff, students and community members participated in the memorial ceremony of candle lighting.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother, Jeff Schmidt, was also present at the ceremony during which the University choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We try to bring our students," said La forge.
The crisis passed.
Today is a day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped to prepare the Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the statement of the police that the call came Lamba 911 after the murder of Schmidt, but also due to the fact that although lamb and spoke about Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the fact that they were married, was not confirmed.

8 survey results that show that Donald trump wasn't joking
Some tried to hang a label him a provocateur.
The other shrugged him off, apprehended as a joke.
And some require of the scandal.
But no matter how I try some Republicans to undermine the high position of Donald trump in the polls, they didn't manage (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed the advantage of Donald trump in double digits, and some are beginning to seriously ask, what does this mean for real estate magnate from the point of view of the chances of getting the nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that trump has a chance to be among the nominees of the Republican party.
Experts indicate that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry was given his premessa growing popularity of Herman Cain, none of whom has won one state in the nomination process.
And there are a lot of reasons why he would began to beat in a General election.
But external groups, such as "Supercomfy political aktivnosti" Jeb Bush, and the economic conservative group "Club for growth" have recognized the relentless force of the trump and start to get their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some figures of the polls, which indicate that tycoon real estate is not just a transitional phase:
The preference rankings for the trump has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the poll at Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans felt positively about the tycoon in real estate.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
In early August it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive attitude towards Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say that they have a negative opinion.
And all these characteristics prevail in the early stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of Republicans polozhitelno there are Trump.
Two-thirds of those who voted for the GOP would suit trump as a candidate.
In a poll CNN/ORC conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they either reacted "with delight" or "satisfaction" if trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as trump (43 percent say they would "enthusiastically" compared to 40 percent of those who said the same thing about trump).
The next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, who is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they are "dissatisfied" or "frustrated", if the establishment favorite Jeb Bush will be the nominee.
Most Republicans do not consider the temperament of the trump problem.
While trump massively criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent leaning toward the Republicans voters across the country think that the tycoon suitable temperament to be President, according to a poll by ABC News/Washington post held on Monday.
The same number appears on the first in the country closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he's the guy who can be a chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he is not the type of person who can be effective in the post, and nearly six in 10 independent voters say that his temperament is not suitable for the White house, according to ABC/Post.
Voters-Republicans get used to the idea.
When they wear their hats experts, voters-the Republicans think that trump is serious.
To the question, who's the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that trump was the favorite according to the poll CNN/ORC last week.
This is not so when four out of 10 have set on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: the voters before the GOP didn't have the correct magic of crystal.
At this time last cycle, cycle four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported a possible candidate MITT Romney.
Nevertheless, it shows that many voters believe GOP campaign trump convincing.
Even if the Republicans would have rallied around another candidate, trump still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts indicate that this variation most likely plays to the advantage of the trump, and at the same time do not support trump's support is evenly distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But the poll, conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical competition "one on one" between trump and other Republican candidates, trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He is ahead of Carly on Fiorino 13 points and Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He has a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who bypasses it?
Ben Carson was running ahead of businessman on a whole 19 points in a hypothetical contest one-on-one.
Slightly more than half of the supporters of Donald trump say that they changed their minds.
A new poll by CBS/NYT, conducted Tuesday, shows that just over half of the voters supporting trump, say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
The less h, the most intense competition at trump at the moment - with a fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they changed their minds, likely to choose the trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with trump about immigration.
Since Donald trump two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "tyrants" in his speech opening the campaign, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant in the conversation in 2016.
Some are concerned that the posturing trump will alienate key voters Hispanics from the Republican party and interfere with the rebranding.
But according to the poll ABC/Post, held on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with trump on immigration.
So until then, until immigration gets all the attention, it seems that Donald trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment with government is gaining new momentum.
Donald trump and Ben Carson now count on the support from about half of voters-Republicans, mostly because of his underdog status.
Six of 10 Republicans in Monday's new poll ABC/Post state that they rather want political outsider than a man with experience in government.
And they also resent Washington.
Poll Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Iowa, conducted two weeks ago shows that three in four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with the activities of Republicans in Congress, while 54 percent of "dissatisfied" and 21% "furious".
The government will decide the fate of indexation of pensions in October.

Jeremy Corbin debuts in the session of Prime Minister's questions.
After the election of Mr. Corbin will make his debut at the session of questions to the Prime Minister is eagerly awaited
The new leader of the labour party Jeremy Corbyn will soon speak at the session of questions to the Prime Minister, the first time meryayas forces with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will present the first of six allotted questions in the second half of the day; his speech will likely be closely watched by the press and members of Parliament from the labour party.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" on a weekly demonstration speech.
Also he stated that he may miss some meetings, leaving their colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as a leader; it will happen after the appointment of the shadow Cabinet and his speech at the annual trades Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile the decision by labour leader to stand silently during the national anthem at the service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was criticized by some conservative members of Parliament and was the topic of several editorials in Newspapers.
The decision of Mr. Corbin not to sing the national anthem caught the attention
Press Secretary Mr. Corbin stated that he "stood in respectful silence" and recognized the "heroism of the Royal air force during the Battle of Britain".
However, the member of the shadow Cabinet, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of the labour party sing the national anthem "apart" from his belief in the necessity of the abolition of the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow Ministers refused to play in the team, Mr. Corbin, voicing disagreements on matters of Economics, defense and international policy, while less than one-sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant said that political differences are also "piling up a stack" in the labour party after the appointment of Mr. Corbin to the position of the European Union and the limitations of government compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin said in the conference Thread of trade unions that the labour party has introduced amendments aimed at the abolition of the very idea of limits in General.
A few hours later Mr. Smith, shadow Minister of labour and pension said that in the party there is a "full clarity" on account of the fact that she was only in opposition to government plans to reduce the upper limit from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the labour party, which David Cameron will meet the "Express box" over the last ten years since becoming leader of the Conservative party.
The labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, States that he "drew collective resources" in order to gain ideas of questions to Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Member of Parliament from the County of Islington North said that the Prime Minister's question cause unnecessary confrontation, and that he will refrain from witty answers and exchange of barbs, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Eagle, the Minister of economy in the shadow Cabinet, will replace him on the issues the Prime Minister when he is absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea to allow other colleagues to take the floor if possible, saying that he appealed to the speaker of the House of Commons, John berkow to discuss this issue.
Becoming leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wants to leave the political style of "fairground booth", often associated with the procedure of questions to the Prime Minister, but admitted years later that he did not succeed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's question became a key indicator for the views of the leader, their ability to manage the House of Commons and reputation among other members of Parliament, although critics complain that this has turned into a caricature and requires extensive reforms.

Metcash is trying to protect their shops against the onslaught of IGA Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
Wholesale supplier of food products from the bottom-has launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the forthcoming infusion company Aldi $ 700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social networks and activities type of "Adelaide Show".
To join the campaign, retailers and suppliers of IGA, such as ice cream maker Simmo's from dunsborough, which offers tasting in the IGA stores, and shop owners who are selling at a discount to regular customers tickets to the matches of football League of South Australia.
It is expected that Metcash will reveal more details of its strategy for the protection 29 September - the day when this wholesale supplier of food products, alcoholic drinks and household goods will hold its annual day strategies the investor.

In a report published this week, Tom Cirat, analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA retailers can lose sales of 360 million dollars per year, and Metcash - $ 250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA, achieving sales of 500 million and 600 million dollars in these markets respectively.
Loss of revenue and sales of food products with a high level of fixed costs Metcash may cost the company about 13 million of earnings before interest and taxes, says Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the Eastern States, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, and this despite the fact that a recent study by Morgan Survey found that the most loyal IGA shoppers.
At Morgan Stanley believe that the sales of food Metcash will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and to 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company's share on the market with 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week a leading Fund Manager Hamish Douglass, Magellan Financial Group founder, said attendees at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "most likely to disappear within a decade.
Company Metcash refused to comment publicly on the comments of Mr. Douglass's.
But it is assumed that the member of the Board of Directors of the company Metcash contacted Mr. Douglaston last week.
The proportion of IGA in the market has decreased since 2010, from 18 percent to 14 percent, and revenues from Metcash business in the food sector that the company supplies about 1,200 retailers IGA, fell by 43 per cent compared with 2012 due to operational and deleverage due to pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not rent, spending more than $ 150 million annually for the adjustment of retail prices with prices in Coles and Woolworths thousand positions weekly and helping IGA retailers in the conversion of trading platforms, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh produce and a wider selection of specialty food products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris said that the adjustment of prices and the conversion of the retail space is gaining momentum, and hopes that the company will achieve increase of net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
The tanasi Kokkinakis supports Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
The tanasi Kokkinakis is deserving of honor, not criticism for their behavior.
The tanasi Kokkinakis indirectly affected in a recent scandal surrounding his friend and kyrgios for his behavior deserves the honor more than criticism, says the President of Tennis Australia Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in the talented Duo and are often called "Special Ks", unwittingly found himself in the spotlight because of embarrassing altercation Kirasa with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly thereafter, during the hot qualifying match in Cincinnati the umpire who twice had to separate the Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, while Harrison said: "Wawrinka was supposed to finish on the blades Kyrios, and I have to lay on the shoulder of the boy."
Since then, as Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racket after a cramp in his leg had saved Richard Gasquet from possible defeat at the US Open, Healy faithfully protects Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second after Bernard Tomic in singles in the semifinals of the Davis Cup against great Britain.
"I am very upset about one thing, namely that Tanasi was drawn into the conflict," said Healy.
He actually broke his racket when he brought his leg at the US Open, but he's not the first player who broke the racket when collapsed hopes, and I know, Tanasi well enough to be sure that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But actually he had a very good in rather provocative situations on the US, with Harrison, etc., and I am sure that he is trustworthy.
It is surrounded by a great team, he has a wonderful family, and I just think that with him were a little unfair.
He's a very Mature 19-year-old man, he works hard, fits perfectly into the team, he never had problems with other players respect him off the court, he trains hard, he's in great shape, he's very motivated and developed young man, and I think that should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiros for important matches, beginning on Friday, believing the "mutual consent" is the correct output for all, but hoping that the guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all we want a team fully focused on the match and not on arguments around the [Kyrios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick has gained strength very fast that prove people like Federer and Murray, he grows in the eyes of the audience, he made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of their actions, and must, I think, to get it out of the spotlight for a while, so he could reflect on them, and it is best for the team and best for him.
The migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares state of emergency, closing the border, detains migrants
Declaring a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia to the southern border and detain anyone trying to enter the country illegally, to keep flowing inside the flow of migrants.
On the border of the riots took place - hundreds of migrants accumulated in the border area, in which sharply negative reaction of the Serbian authorities.
Stuck indefinitely on the stretch of road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland, have pitched tents and settled in this area.
However, discontent was growing.
When they were circling police helicopter, migrants were shouting "Open the border!" and chanted insults against the Hungarian special police.
Some in protest, has refused food and water.
The Minister of foreign Affairs of Serbia has declared "unacceptable" the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, when more and more comes from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
It is necessary in the coming days to hold talks with Brussels and other countries", - said in Prague Ivica Dacic.
The unrest in the Hungarian-Serbian border was opened the next day after a bloc of 28 countries could not develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking refuge in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future (next month or by the end of the year) will reach an agreement, according to which member States of the European Union will take further 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded to collect next week's emergency EU summit to discuss the immigration crisis that engulfed the continent.
Hungary, however, hopes for quick action on the part of Brussels or neighbors.
Declared Tuesday a state of emergency in two southern regions gave the government more power to act in relation to the crisis, which allowed them to block roads and to speed up court cases for asylum.
Meanwhile, the Minister of foreign Affairs Wengie Peter Siarto stated that his country also intends to build a barbed wire fence on the border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country, now that she has finished the fence on Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even the prisoners were connected to urgent work by the end of the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the last few months Hungary has become a major bottleneck and border crossing point of the EU for immigrants, many of whom are refugees - victims of war in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of new arrivals in the country people are economic migrants, seeking a more prosperous life, not refugees - victims of hostilities, who are entitled to protection, and this view is sharply at odds with the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws, enacted in Hungary in effect at midnight, now consider the intersection of a crime or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison terms for the accused in human trafficking.
"Because of the situation, caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency", - told reporters the government representative Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, the Parliament still needs to authorize the deployment of military forces that is expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters who are on the border, for the past few days there watching the presence of heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs.
Bakondi Gyorgy, Orban adviser on national security, reported the capture by the authorized bodies of the 45 people who were trying to cross the border, on the border, and another 15 people - within the country.
They crossed the border, broke down the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities quickly restore the fence.
The Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven passes on the border with Serbia, having driven for blocking one of the aisles a railway carriage, wrapped in barbed wire.
Riots broke out on the main passage through the border near the town Roske (Hungary), as the Hungarians placed the premises for the passage of people inside a metal container, and crowds of people crushed each other to get inside.
To get inside managed about 20 persons, while thousands of people were left outside.
Another group of migrants has blocked the main road leading from Serbia to Hungary, and announced the refusal of food and water, until they get into Hungary.
Election 2016: Advantage Hillary Clinton over Bernard Sanders has halved in the national poll
Former Secretary of state Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the race Democrats for the nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders catches up with her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent among primary voters-Democrats (down 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to run for President, gets the support of 15 percent of primary voters-Democrats.
For more than five months before the start of competition in primary elections the majority of voters-Democrats say it is too early to say that they have identified the candidate who will support.
Clinton supporters are more sure of your choice, rather than maintenance of other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost the support of some demographic groups, but Sanders has made some good bonuses.
Clinton holds a wide advantage among women and moderate, but this advantage decreased.
Her support among men has dropped dramatically, and Sanders behind her only by 5 points.
The preference of Clinton voters-Democrats and 50, disappeared, and he and Sanders are now on equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders on a two-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
Almost half of primary voters-Democrats across the country say they enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the candidate from this party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps it is not surprising that the current Clinton supporters will most likely show a little more enthusiasm into her account.
Among those who currently support Clinton, the more controversial views - only about a quarter of enthusiastically supported it.
While 48 percent of primary voters-Democrats say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer voters-Republicans say the same about their leader, Donald trump (35 percent).
When the supporters of the Clinton asks an open-ended question, why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer - that she has the right experience (16 per cent), then now is the time female President (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate to this post (10 percent).
Also supporters of Clinton say about the Association, connecting her with bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also called soglasna on and chances of being elected.
As Vice-President considering potential participation in elections, 57 percent of primary voters Democrats would like him to join the race - though a third believes that he should not.
When they are asked who they would like to see in second place among candidates from the party, the primary voters-Democrats in most cases called Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half said that they would choose Biden second, it's more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to nominate his candidacy from the Democratic party, the advantage Hillary Clinton over Sanders will increase with 20 points with Biden among the participants of the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of voters-Democrats see Clinton the candidate with the best chance of winning in the General election; however, this figure declined from 78 percent last month.
By this measure, Biden far behind in second place, but the percentage of those who considered it the most likely candidate, have increased.
However, answering the question that is most important in a candidate, the voters Democrats have chosen other options in addition to chances to be elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the candidates from the Democrats or potential candidates not nominated is not acceptable for these primary voters.
Candidates from the Democrats, or potential candidates, showed a good result on some of the key characteristics among primary voters from his own party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, Biden and honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in honesty and strong side of Clinton, in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of primary voters-Democrats do not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, two times more than those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent have no definite opinion about him on this account.
Primary voters Democrats also generally believe similar ideological views Clinton, Sanders and Biden.
All of these measures about a quarter of voters-Democrats don't have any opinion about Sanders.
Although the questions regarding personal email and servers at Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of state continues, most primary voters-Democrats are satisfied with her explanation and believe that it did not adversely affect their overall opinion about it.
But that's a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today unsatisfied by her explanation, but met only about one-third.
The public opinion about this was divided in March, shortly after this story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy over e-mail did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent say their opinion about it worsened.
This is mainly the Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who argues that their opinion of Clinton was worse.
Even though I consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, voters from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent consider it to be fair and credible, eight points lower than the previous month, and 15 compared with may.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider her honest and trustworthy.
At the same time 55 registered voters across the country do not consider trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and trump both, however, get good marks for leadership qualities.
Of the six tested candidates Biden, Carson and Bush show the best result for fairness.
Most of us see in Sanders, rather, an honest man, than no, but how about Carson, many do not have any opinion.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary voters-Democrats is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national poll, Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the latest poll by CBS/New York Times
These two candidates received half of the votes in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of support underfoot
Voters-Republicans across the country continue to support trump, the percentage of support increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll conducted on the eve of the debate on Fox News last month, to 27% in the poll conducted Tuesday.
But Carson has skyrocketed over the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoys the support of all demographic groups, surpassing trump in the group of voters-Republicans with high education.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, moved backward together with the Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support dropped from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator from Florida Marco Rubio together occupy the third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 voters-Republicans in this latest poll is plus or minus 6%, the survey was conducted in September.
A recent survey by CNN/ORC released last week, showed an increase of Carson in the polls showing support 19% among Republicans, trump with 32% support.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also show that trump is far ahead of the Carson.
In connection with the growing support for Carson last week, trump made several critical attacks on the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning the faith trump.
"We need energy," said trump last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
The five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
About two years later after the death of a College student during the ritual of initiation into the brotherhood in the Pocono mountains in Pennsylvania the charge of murder was brought against five persons.
"The members of the fraternity PI Delta Psi from the new York College Baruch brutally attacked Chan "Michael" Deng during the ritual of initiation in September 2013 and did not deliver it on time to the hospital, which resulted in his death", - have informed in police.
Officials say that student is blindfolded and 30-pound bag of sand behind pushed several times while he was trying to reach the goal, walking on slippery surfaces.
Mr. Deng in the end complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the fraternity PI Delta Psi did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and presumably waited another hour before you get him to a hospital, the police say.
They did, however, find time to change clothes Deng, to find in Google of his symptoms and to contact Andy Meng, national President of the fraternity, to ask for advice, as told at a press conference police chief Chris Wagner.
"At this point, the members of the brotherhood began to hide personal possessions, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity above the health of Michael Deng," said chef Wagner.
It could not save, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received several blunt traumas to the head, torso and hips.
"Too many families have suffered as a result of rituals of initiation into the brotherhood, because at least one student dies during them every year since 1970," he said in his statement Douglas Fierberg, the lawyer representing the family of Deng.
The brotherhood and their members must bear the responsibility, and this move by the authorities is very important.
The jury of Monroe County tend to favor the prosecution in the murder of the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, get a rape charge over the newcomer and conspiracy.
"We want to hold liable not only individual participants, but if there is a organization that authorized it officially or unofficially, then," said Wagner at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood and national brotherhood was expelled from his local branch structure.
What happens when the Federal reserve will raise interest rates
There will be a rate increase, and "the market of bulls" to stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how much time will pass before the onset, and how long it will last.
Specifically for the economy of the story doesn't explain much about the time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and by as much as 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal reserve to raise rates often, although not always, determines the responsiveness of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the administration of the Central Bank of the United States so insistently stresses that investors should focus on when it will start raising rates and how much is adaptation.
In fact, the game has many variables.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss about the rate increase is exaggerated.
"The first rate hike by the Federal reserve since the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of "cheap money", said Julian Jessop, chief specialist in international Economics at Capital Economics, in his commentary to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of interest rates to a more normal, but still low levels of seismic impulse, which many fear.
This does not mean, however, that the effects will be.
Here's a look at how you could respond to some areas of the economy depending on historical trends:
As we have already seen the market over the last month or so, the expectation of increasing interest rates can lead to instability for some time.
At higher rates, however, the consequences aren't usually so dramatic.
"It doesn't seem to income from shares slowed down for 12-24 months after the first jump, which, again, probably reflects the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the results of a rate increase by the Federal reserve.
More specifically, the market for the last about 35 years, often changes dramatically - about 14 percent - in the direction of increasing interest rates, remains quite smooth within 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, return to normal with an average return of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Dole, the senior specialist in strategy shares trading at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche said that the result for securities tends to be more pronounced at the stage of raising interest rates, and equity returns begin to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but raising interest rates often play a contribute to them.
In this case, the fed is put in such conditions that have not existed before and can speed up the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point for all time of existence of high rates.
To approve Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of povyshena rates since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few believe that it's a long time, despite the fact that in the third quarter it stands at only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in such an unstable economic background that may be risky, and poses the question "will there be this time is different", according to Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates Federal reserve system the entire year, with their eyes riveted on the meeting of the Federal open market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many experts and economists believe that the FOMC could approve the rate increase at this meeting, futures trading says only 25% probability.
"In our study, since 1950, all cycles rate hikes to date was in the superloop increasing financial leverage with GDP, overlapping peaks that precede a recession, very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report said.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle at the moment - the longest, which the Federal reserve was waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and in total it lasted for 74 months and not over yet.
Fixed income has also become unstable as the market expects rate hikes, and this scenario is in some ways similar to the one implemented for the stock.
A fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect comes faster than for stocks when the Federal system changed strategic course.
In the case of bonds it appears that the yield changes the vector immediately after the occurrence of the first increase/decrease in the rates cycle.
At the end of the tightening cycle the yield of the bonds falls immediately", according to Deutsche.
Specialists in the strategy of Charles Schwab believe the increase in rates will cause the yield levels of long-term and short-term bonds will converge, making the curve more flat.
Bonds with high yield often behave better in this climate, although "we still fear the fluctuations of profitability", - stated in the study Katie Jones, analyst fixed income at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adjusted to the expected policy outcomes of the Federal system.
"In addition to the strengthening U.S. dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans rose, the yield curve flattened, credit spreads widened, volatility increased - all characteristics of a market with tightening policy of the Federal system.
Generally speaking, the companies main business in the USA, will benefit from higher interest rates, and local production will become more attractive.
International company with lots of debt will be in worse position because the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space, and their debt is more expensive - in financial.
"History shows that "quality" stocks demonstrate the effectiveness of the above market within three months after the initial rate hike," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report to clients.
Company with stable financial state of the company walked to the unstable state for each rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital as well as stocks with low volatility have also shown better efficacy than low quality stocks, on average, 4 (percentage points), and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt becomes a big question.
Companies with a high percentage of debt with floating rate will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Investors could see a profit through higher yield, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of Classic FM," says a member of Parliament from the conservative Andrew Bingham
Member of Parliament from the conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "lowering the standards"
Proves that it is becoming less distinguishable from the commercial competitor
Also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award just ripped off from the Brits
Colleague in Parliament Damien Collins, struck with The Voice the same criticism, was not the original
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM", - said the leader of members of Parliament, prompting the broadcaster to prove that she's doing something, not commercial companies.
Member of Parliament from the conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that it seems as if public radio is "stupid" and becomes less and less distinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "simplification" - but she seems to be turning into Classic FM," said he.
He also set his sights on the prize BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which was launched last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you are trying to do something different - here are two examples that first came to my mind in which you actually only copy that is already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
Director General of the BBC has denied the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival, when it comes to live music and education audience.
What I'm learning, thanks to Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to playing live and making music really can not be compared with anyone else.
"It is also really important, I think, the interest of Radio 3 in search of new music and promoting new works", - he said.
Earlier this year the Manager of BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey argued that radio stations have to work much harder to attract an audience than in the past because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not only the brainchild of the BBC which has been attacked for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearings of the special Committee on culture, media and sport.
Member of Parliament from the Tory Damian Collins attacked The Voice - music talent show, which the BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media at today's price of 22 million pounds sterling.
See why this program is often discussed in connection with the lack of originality and distinguishing features?
Lord Hall said that the BBC show 1, in which the judges participate Paloma faith and boy George, was done in "the typical style of the BBC".
He added that the Corporation wants to "found a hit in your own home the barn" next time it will start entertaining project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to interfere with the order of new seasons of The Voice in the future or use the money of those who pay the license fee, other entertainment formats.
The growth of Internet sales is maximally slowed in August, and the reason for it may be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, an increase in online sales by seven percent
Last month was the slowest growth since then, as it began to see in 2000
Online sales have increased three years ago through the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that November's Black Friday could help curb spending
Within about ten years of virtual shopping is experiencing a boom, turning many downtown streets in Britain into Ghost towns.
But experts say that now is showing signs of leveling online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending on online shopping in August showed minimal growth since then, as they began to record in 2000, an increase of only five percent.
Experts say that now is showing signs of leveling online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and going back to 2000, they always found a reasonable explanation," he told the Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor of sales index, IMRG.
He explained that online selling has been intensified three years ago when buyers began to use their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people had the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do it in any conditions, for example, sitting on the couch.
But now it reaches a plateau, and you can see the decline (growth).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, who came from America, is mentioned as one of the causes of slowing sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from purchases on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year the buyers in the amount of five times more than the average hurried to the computers, to be able to make use of the offers, thus bringing down several websites of sellers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers come into a real battle for best buy, could get people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over 1 out of every £ 5 spent online.
With regard to goods such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third is sold through their online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more readily than in the boutiques on the Central streets.
Muslims bury the dead in crane fall in Mecca, and the family of bin Laden sanctioned
The Muslims are carrying the bodies of 29 victims in the streets, as in Mecca are the first funeral
At the same time Saudi Arabia has partially laid the blame for the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after crane collapse
Hundreds of Muslims from everywhere flocked to the streets to bury the 29 victims killed in the collapse of a crane at the Grand mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mainly in white, mourners filled the roadway, to pay homage to the first among the dead, which went on its last journey to the cemetery Al-Moaissem.
The sad procession passed by the Holy place, where only a few days earlier, a construction crane struck the ceiling of the mosque and fell to the parishioners.
The bodies were issued for the funeral, and at the same time the king of the Saudis fined a construction company owned by the bin Laden family, for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The body 29 of the parishioners who died in the collapse of a crane in the Main mosque, was carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram from Bolton, greater Manchester, who was in his first pilgrimage, when collapsed crane.
Mr. Akram was the Main mosque with their parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, king Salman said that the Binladin Group was not supposed to leave the crane boom is raised at the idle crane.
In the Arabic version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency, said that Binladin Group bears part of the blame for the collapse.
English version news not told about the details, but said that company leaders were forbidden to travel outside of the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason of falling of the crane into the courtyard of the Main mosque, which receives hundreds of thousands of Muslims for this month to go on Hajj.
Binladin Group has not made any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were unavailable for comment.
The Royal decree also accused the company of non-use of modern safety measures and inadequate coordination of action with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main mosque of Mecca, in the framework of large-scale construction works, which leads Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family for decades, is among the confidants of the ruling family of Saudi Arabia and manages the largest construction projects.
The late al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was the son of the traitor from whom the family disowned in the 1990s.
The accident occurred when strong winds and rain just days before the Kingdom, millions of people came to participate in the pilgrimage, which is compulsory at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said that in the hospital stay of 158 people.
Officials agreed to pay one million riyals (approximately 174 000 pounds) to the relatives of the deceased, and the same amount irreversibly crippled.
The remaining victims will get half this amount.

According to véronique Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring specialists for repair
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result is opening over 200 new stores Screwfix for professionals

Because, according to the company that owns B&Q, the British have all my վ hire professional artists to perform simple household chores.
Veronique Laurie, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a network of services for home improvement, said that this trend is a significant influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, offering services at the lowest prices.
As a result Kingfisher is planning to open another 200 stores Screwfix, specializing in products for and to close 60 stores-warehouses of B&Q.
Ms. Lori said that would like to see more women in the staff of the stores B&Q, as eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are accepted by the fairer sex.
Currently the majority of staff were men.
According to her, one cannot ignore the recent demographic trends, characterized by the fact that a growing number of households consisting of single women who are more engaged in the furnishing of their homes than in the past.
Ms. Laurie said, "our stores are still predominantly male.
You must take steps to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of decisions on the products they buy are taken by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Lori is one of five women standing at the helm of the UK's leading companies, whose shares are recorded in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the team of top-managers, having achieved among the Directors an equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50% of executives are women, including CEO and CFO.
Ms. Lori said, "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
To find suitable women to the Board of Directors was easy.
After the group took over the costs of closing stores, the company Kingfisher showed a decline in profit and sales for six months.
As a result of this trend Kingfisher, which owns brands Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new stores
The time of the decision on the interest rate of the Federal Reserve USA
The world is watching conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank meeting in two days discussed a critical decision - to raise or not the interest rate for the first time in over a decade.
The poll of 80 economists, conducted by Reuters showed that just over half of those who last week thought the fed would do that, now I believe that he still will wait a little and will keep interest rate at the current range of 0-0. 25 percent.
This is a historic event, because it's been seven years since then, as the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
The first time we come to the fact that the Central Bank may shift from zero and to begin the process of normalizing interest rates," said angel Ubide, senior fellow Institute for international Economics Peterson.
The US economy is running efficiently, the economic growth adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and inflation is low.
However, the Federal reserve can't ignore how the decision will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets about what to prepare for the changes, but it speaks to their confidence that all the odds are against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: the refugees coming into the EU through Croatia.
"Open up!" chant hundreds of refugees at the checkpoint Horgos on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Tuesday-Budapest closed the border for immigrants.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to test the more options of routes to the EU.
One of them bypassing closed border with Serbia through Romania.
Another is through Croatia and Slovenia to Austria.
According to some, the buses that transported refugees from Serbia to Hungary, now head to the Sidu town on the Croatian border.
Drivers have been ordered by authorities to follow without interruption.
Serbian interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovic assured that his country was doing everything in her power to help the refugees, but their scope is limited:
Our job is to protect Serbia as possible.
On the other hand, we also need to help these people, to ensure humane attitude towards them.
But this is a Europe-wide problem.
It is not easy to solve, no European country alone can not cope with this, and especially such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border for refugees who don't want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor orbán is adamant:
If someone is called a refugee in Serbia, he must complete the necessary documents.
But if he will not do, and in our country it is not let in, because in Serbia is quite safe.
Hungary has already built a 175-micrometry fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban to stop not going: he plans to build the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already announced that it is incompatible with European principles.
Evangelos Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Evangelos Meimarakis for several years was part of the centre-right government, which resulted, according to the leftists, the country to the financial crisis.
Now he, becoming temporary leader of the party New democracy, Tsipras defies.
A few days before the election, he met with the journalist of Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews.
Evangelos Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing coalition SYRIZA, but now, according to polls, New democracy equaled it in popularity.
What has changed during this time?
Evangelos Meimarakis: Changed Greece, and so are we.
Mr Tsipras has lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and economic growth prospects.
Now the country is once again budget deficit and high unemployment.
Investors left because Mr. Tsipras sent them off.
Over the last nine months among the Greeks was an opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promises Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare promised with what has actually happened.
Daily life became noticeably worse compared with January, when the situation improved, and it concerned the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you are saying that in case of election victory will be to seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Evangelos Meimarakis: the fact that, as we have learned over recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries that operated or still operate the rescue programme, the political forces and the ruling party all came together to implement a program in which they have agreed, without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That's why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in support of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's lenders.
If on Monday you'll be the Prime Minister, will you comply with the agreement or try to change it, at least in part?
Evangelos Meimarakis: actually we voted for the motion Greece is the European way, because we understand the harmful consequences would have led the country's withdrawal from the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would be lost if it were not for the agreement with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of how Mr Tsipras was negotiating.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe will see that the new Greek government during its first year in power wants to restore order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the program of salvation, then I'm sure all commitments that could not be performed due to the fact that lead to a recession, may again be the subject of negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It is wrong to assume that in the first year of the new agreement we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors because they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their confidence, we must continue privatization, reforms and structural changes that were agreed to, while continuing to benefit from EU funding and larger investment opportunities which we need to access for a better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government has not provided any serious arguments on many key political issues that we found while discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
Can you give an example associated with the farmers ' income.
We explained to our European partners that we are not talking about a fixed monthly income, and therefore he cannot fully be taxed in advance.
We were told that the Ministers Tsipras never spoke.
That is, the Greek Ministers were not prepared and ill informed, but because of poorly conducted negotiations and entered into a bad agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, he will soon be at the same table with Mr Juncker, Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Does it make any difference what you tell them, tell them your predecessor Antonis Samaras?
Evangelos Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we tried to do the 2012 agreement, bypassing the available in it the sharp corners.
We pushed forward the reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we have acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell and not see the potential buyers willing to pay the price, arranging the Greek government.
I was the speaker of the Parliament, I was able to harmonize the views of three parliamentary groups, the government then constituted a majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working Parliament, and that in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would be improved if the process was not interrupted early General elections that are the result of December's presidential election.
Euronews: Last week, on the territory of Greece is moving a mass flow of refugees.
What do you think about this situation, and about the reaction of European countries, who seek these people?
Evangelos Meimarakis: the refugee Crisis is a time bomb with which we have to deal after winning the election.
And the reason is that the SYRIZA government has not acted in this situation as they should.
In such matters should be proactive, because if the problem catches up with you, then be only an emergency measure.
And we are now in exactly this situation.
Even the interim government, which replaced the SYRIZA, in just seven days has done more than Mr. Tsipras made in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim government, which has provided valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, called for a summit of the EU, will allow to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and note that refugees not illegal immigrants.
Are war victims in Syria, the victim of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
This question is a deeply humanitarian aspect, and we will adhere to the position that European policy should take in this new situation.
The decision should be taken at the EU summit, must be involved and the United Nations.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and centers for reception.
We also need to effectively use economic assistance received from the EU in order to be able to cope with this urgent problem.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Evangelos Meimarakis: Thank you.

The man who opened fire at the University of the state of the Delta, left a note of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later in the day - Shannon lamb wrote a note saying that he "regrets" about the first murder and would like to "change it back", said the authorized bodies on Tuesday.
Police in the city of Gautier, Mississippi, reports that the teacher of geography and social Sciences at the University of the state of the Delta, called 911 at about 10 am.
Monday and reported that he shot.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people home with him.
He said: "last night I killed my wife" and mentioned that the house is "doggie" who "won't bother anyone", but probably upset.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb did not explain why he opened fire.
Arriving at the crime scene, police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41 years old, and a hand-written note from Lamba, 45 years old, which stated: "I'm sorry, I would like to turn it back on.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
Writing a note, lumb drove 300 miles to state University of the Delta, where they killed Ethan Schmidt, history Professor, and on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by police, committed suicide.
Rector of the University, William La forge reported that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamba and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamba was clearly something on your mind".
Despite released on Monday information about what lamb thought the romance between Prentiss and Schmidt, official service on Tuesday reported that it "lack of any information or evidence" of the "love triangle".
About Prentiss said as "a good man" Sean O Steen, who reported that he was married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O Steen said that he and Prentiss have a daughter 19, and that she was "inconsolable".
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsay Knowles, the newspaper "sun Herald" calls a close friend Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss was a hunting dog named lightning, and she met with Lambom about three years.
Knowles said: "She always wanted to help people".
According to police, lamb on Monday at some point called relatives to say that "in prison he will not go".
The same evening when the police overtook him on the highway "1" near Greenville, lamb stopped the car, jumped out, ran into the woods and there shot himself.
According to a summary posted on the University website, in the spring of 2015 lamb received at the University of the state of the Delta, a PhD in the field of pedagogy.
Stars who lost their fortune
The actor (left) in a photo with his son Redmond (right), survived a few difficult years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-life partner Farrah Fawcett, dead of cancer.
Reportedly, the actor also suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this undoubtedly played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be out for several months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a match of the Champions League, in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender worries about that, because that would not be able to come on the pitch at least for six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that the Show will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during a reckless tackle on Hector Moreno in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty area.
He assisted on the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before you get to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "he Has a double fracture and he's in the hospital".
He was being moved to Manchester tomorrow or a day later, and then operated on.
It's awful - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18 years, overcame great difficulties and began to play fantastically, and then it happened.
In the locker room he was wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it for six months, and the guy will not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he will be able to play again this season.
Moreno's lucky he's not received a red card and no penalty shot.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes that the Italian judge had made a mistake.
Judge for yourself, when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad tackle with two feet.
In the Twitter of the Show writes: "Thank you all for your messages, words can not describe how devastated I am that my path to recovery begins, I will be back stronger than I was".
More on topic: Manchester United is going through unhappiness with Luke Shaw with the defeat in the game against PSV
The English defender will be more motivated to recover for the European Championships in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "This is a very severe injury".
When any player is out with an injury like that, all upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure their opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against a team of Holland under the guidance of van Gaal at the World Cup 2014
"He's very frustrated now, because he had no intentions to hurt the enemy, and when you hear that this is a very severe injury, feel sick," said Cocu.
I was not able to see the moment.
The only thing I could see is the ball, which flew in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) has touched him, but I didn't see the tackle under the Hatch.
In an interview with SBS6 Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to carry.
Very hard for me, and I'm sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron about "the Lorax" is there anything else?
Every parent quickly learns one thing: if your child is like a book, a little time will pass before you will know it almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
Responding to a question from the representative of the company dealing with organization of children's rest in vacation, of his beloved children's book, the Prime Minister chose "the Lorax" is a tale with an environmental slant, written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a tough choice, Cameron wrote in comments published on the website of the company SuperCamps, and continues: "This funny, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to their children, because it always found some way or the message that we miss."
And all would be well, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron, as expected, retell the content of the books, but actually tells the story of the same movie, filmed in 2012, with new characters and details added to enhance the rather short original narrative.
"Surrounded by the high walls of the city in thneedville, where there was no greenery and even air is sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," we read in the text description of a love story, an unknown Dr. Seuss (real name Theodor seuss Geisel,), who died in 1991.
If it looks suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads almost like a summary of the plot of the movie "the Lorax", has been posted on the Internet Movie Database: "surrounded by high walls of the city in thneedville where everything is artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being, admittedly, an active parent is so unfamiliar with the content of the book, which is not named after the boy learns about how the environment destroys the greedy press of trees and bosom "of Samneric" the once-ler, despite the protests of Araxa (whose name is in the title of the book) is a funny creature with a moustache who "speaks for the trees".
Most likely, such a simple PR task was entrusted to artist, never read a child a book about Lorax 20 times in a row.
Representative Downing Street said that the text was allegedly received from the office of Cameron in the constituency.
The company SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from the headquarters of Cameron, but the further comments has not followed.
For Adam, Lita clearly there was a risk not to get in England, but it's still a complicated question
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team, which England have selected for this tour, a repeat of the defeat in the test series 3-0, what happened last time, it seems likely to me.
I would also not rule out a victory at home.
The team Alistair cook, perhaps less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but it has a batter among the players, a virtuoso host curveballs, and collective thinking much; they bring with them scars from 2012 and the only Junior positive.
With the ball Moen Ali turns into a bowler, batsmen curve balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
More on topic: Adam Lit out of the England test cricket and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to expel Adam Lita me, his head coach in "Yorkshire," of course, it is difficult to analyze.
In his seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and obvious, but the harsh reality is that the cricketers are assessed by the judges by the result.
No questions on John Rue, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said it before) the better players just choose themselves.
Pair palustan, and Lita could wait a longer career, but he was in the power of their own fate.
I hope that if he will score more runs for "Yorkshire", will be another opportunity.
The head coach of the England team, Trevor Bayliss, said nice things about his attitude, even when he didn't show what I was capable of, and it doesn't surprise me; he is first and foremost a team player, and then everything else.
Question, how much time will pass before the batsman of test cricket will leave an impression of yourself - difficult question.
Lita has played in seven games as Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Compton only got a chance to play on his own and in a foreign field.
The only thing you could complain is the fact that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League, when Lita was in the best shape, but a lost opportunity in the past.
Alex appears hails, and he batsman, which I rate highly.
He's unpredictable cricketer that we saw in the Yorkshire club earlier this season, when he scored 236 in a match against us at the site Trent bridge, that was already something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who came before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea to put Moena near the cook as an opening batsman, which would give us the opportunity to introduce additional spinner, keeping four fast bowlers, thinking, and I'm not against it.
I see no reason that the kicker cannot hit the ball, and this left-hander has already shown that he's a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what you need for your County Worcestershire, but became the third room for them, and the big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches, "the third batsman" before you go as opening in 2001.
He won immediately three hundreds and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and with my brief communication with him he seemed like a very promising young man.
People can look at their statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and to think that this is a risky bet, but among the spinners voting "for" a little bit, and taking selected youth.
He'll learn a lot in this tour.
In addition to the national team, England is planning to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
Appointment Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be the master stroke.
He's one of the best guys to play with, who will bring a wealth of experience, obtained under all possible conditions and in all attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins in the games where you use a white ball, and will ensure both energy and relentless pace in the setup.
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether playing or coaching, and how Mahela, has considerable intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has been said before, can give new strength to the team.
Colleague Collie on the team Durham's Ben Stokes left for the day, Ruth provided a similar break in connection with Australia, and I for one feel about this problem.
Although not all will agree with this, coaches and individuals, which selects the players do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never made easily.
The camp of supporters of a British exit from the EU can win, if the economy is depressed by 2017
Ill-conceived policies of David Cameron for the resumption of negotiations about keeping Britain in the EU every day experiences more and more difficulties, even without regard to the election of the brilliant Jeremy-"It's a Yes or no?"- Corbin leader of the labour party or the TUC resentment about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have the Corbin and Nicely Faradji.
Friendly European diplomat explained the other day that with the situation in which the EU is now experiencing a variety of crises - not all of them are of their own making - some of the participating countries are fed up with British self-centered agenda of divisive concessions and undermining the agreement changes, which they mostly don't want.
Gathered in Brighton for the annual meeting, TUC decided that he doesn't want them anyway, if they destroy social security.
We could even call it "selfie of the program Dave and George".
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance riding on the summits and bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, photograph themselves on the background of a famous local monument, in the company of a local celebrity, or without her, then come home and say that they attract allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants interested in maintaining external contacts Britain under the awning of the European Union - "don't leave us, along with France," says the Berlin - suggests that blinkered Ministers and officials in some capitals came to understand, when they stop caring, we'll stay or go.
Angela Merkel, wary of the Chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she has been in office for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation will worsen for her as she deteriorated for staying late at his place of Margaret Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and nick (16).
The head of France Francois Hollande faces a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He also loses power.
Poland may soon receive the government of the nationalist right-wing, Spain on the left.
It's hard to see them going out of their way to help "self-Brits", whose energy could be spent on preventing the exit of Scotland from the UK - what they don't want to either, because most places there are similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these Ministers can even schedule the issuance of deliberately useless remarks in the style of the SNP during the referendum campaign in the UK in 2017 to spur the process of British exit from the EU, involves my friend.
"The review was an obsession" and "Britain nothing of value was gained from the renewed negotiations."
The Europeans on the trouble know what kind of predator could be fleet street, and as skeptical towards the EU are set media moguls, in contrast to running times of Tony Benn the referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 the ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, an inveterate Euro-opportunist, famous for his "straight bananas in the EU" Brussels correspondent in the early ' 90s.
For all its stupidity ed Milliband knew who his enemies.
They included a motley crew of crooks who fear taxes, phone hackers-outsiders and pseudo-residents, who own most of our major Newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair was about them quite of your opinion, but be aware that when you are in a cage with a wild gorilla, you have to give her a banana to distract her and not give her to eat you for lunch and again for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more of a fan of Blair than Blair himself in opposition to the idea of Cameron about a referendum, because Blair sacrificed her principles in favor of the cancelled EU Constitution, buried French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him the winning ticket.
None of this press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbin, who kindly patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he no longer has time to waste on me - it seems that risks repeating the strategy of Neil Kinnock "boycott Murdoch" from the 80's - a mistake now and then.
It may take time, but it needs to develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press are not with me, but definitely with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the air force he sat on Sunday.
The official position of Corbin in Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside traditionalists Ukip tendencies and a wider range of "supporters little England" among tories can probably say "Yes."
It's the same thing that Hillary is"a Benn, but not Bennet"Benn said on the radio and TV this week, with his inner boy scout struggling refused to acknowledge that the appointment of Corbin obnoxious John McDonnell "shadow" Minister of Finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70 years, when his old father struggles fought on TV for disloyalty to colleagues in the labour Cabinet without going too far and losing his post in the Cabinet.
Battle Hilary was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay "under any circumstances" - a phrase of Benn - not that, said McDonnell, and is not what j is. K. told peers and MPs at a private meeting on Monday evening, according to General opinion.
Whatever wanted to let Democrat and "your guy" Corbin - remember, he even touched me - the discipline of the messages remains important in an age of round-the-clock television seven days a week, and especially in the maelstrom of social networks, the outbreak of paranoia and betrayal.
It's wise not to give Cameron so just to get away from Europe, enabling it to take for granted the support of the labour party during the campaign for the referendum, said McDonnell.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the basic fallacy McDonnell and Corbyn about membership in the EU in the framework of the "banditskoi" economy under siege - is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism is generated minor distinction is a Central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about NATO - Tom Watson steadfast that j.To. won't agitate for an exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring it up to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin to spend political capital - they also have a suspicious voters, Britain's concessions, when it all could be pointless?
USA very disappointed already weak military operations of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though a Tory government in power cuts costs, which reminded me of Sunday lunch on a certain forum called British Influence Security.
Experts are criticizing a review of e-cigarettes from Public Health England
Statements government-funded Agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than Smoking, was made at a meeting of 12 people, some of which are associated with the tobacco industry, as reported by the researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with the Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Agency Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published a major report - "a milestone" last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
But some researchers questioned the accuracy of the data and indicated a relationship of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized the "extremely shaky argument" on the basis of which PHE has constructed its main conclusion.
The article in the BMJ two researchers have wondered whether these claims under a "solid or shaky grounds".
Martin McKee, Professor of European health at the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine and Simon Capwell, lecturer clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "the Fundamental principle of public health - rules must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
According to them, the public expects that the PHE statement that "the best current estimates show that electronic cigarettes is about 95% less harmful than tobacco Smoking" was based on a detailed analysis of evidence and modeling.
In fact, it is derived from only 12 of the meeting of people gathered to develop a model for multicriteria analysis of decision making in order to summarize their opinions about the harm associated with different nikotinsoderzhaschie products; the results of the meeting are summarized in scientific publications.
McKee and Capwell reported that one of the conference sponsors was a company called EuroSwiss Health, on the General Director informed us that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent study.
He also confirmed the BAT certificates in the field of health in the sustainable development report.
One of 12 people at the meeting announced the funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, not to mention funding, which he reportedly previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation of the choice of Council members was not provided, but among them are several well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which are also stated on the financing of the industry in the publication.
It is unknown whether the other participants ' management experience in the tobacco business.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco trend in PHE.
Research article published by the group, "gracefully agreed" with the fact that there is a lack of "compelling evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most of the criteria," wrote Mackie and Capwell.
However, none of these relations and constraints were not covered in the PHE report.
McKee and Capwell told that the PHE statement that "to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, cause children or non-smokers to smoke", are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and wellbeing at PHE, said that the BMJ statement previously given answers.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco Smoking".
One of the two smoked all his life died from his addiction.
All the evidence implies that health risks from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term consequences.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what is and what prove do not prove the evidence, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger in comparison with tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from diseases associated with Smoking, and Smoking costs the NHS 2 billion pounds a year.
Clearly indicating the obvious - that while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they are only part of the harm done by Smoking - we perform our tasks before the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 believes that the BBC should stop EastEnders
The former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop the production of such programmes as EastEnders and The Voice, noticing that their business rivals would give much for such a successful show like a soap Opera about the "albert Square".
Johnson noticed that the license fees should be used only for such programs that are not issued by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for what the company puts transmission of public broadcasting, which probably looks only a small part of the audience for peak airtime when competitors go show with high ratings, and channels such as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said the Corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he for six years tried unsuccessfully to collaborate with the BBC while working on Channel 4.
"I can't help thinking that the BBC is preparing to launch, and broadcasts that could show the competing companies are not subsidised," said Johnson to the members of the Committee on communications of the house of lords in the framework determine the further fate of the BBC.
If you save the license fee that I don't consider a good solution in the medium and long term, the company should remain on the air only those programs that are not issued and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice is aired in the Prime slot, because the creators want to get the best possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else didn't show it, laughable and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to funding programs that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they own production.
Other channels, no doubt, much would be given to her.
I don't understand how this could be public broadcasting.
I don't think it somehow would diminish the BBC.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, head of channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC in the pursuit of ratings "because of the ambitions of employees and because of their faith in what is the best way to get support for the long term".
His comments about the most popular show on BBC echo the comments of the Executive Director of Sky, Tony ball, in his lecture to the memory of MacTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003 offered to sell the BBC series like EastEnders.
Johnson noticed that the more niche BBC public nature "continue to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audience, but the function of the company is made, and this can be presented as an argument in self-righteous sermons justifying the income from license fees 4 billion pounds: "well, Yes, of course, we do all these strange programs that no one is looking".
They put them in the slot where no one will ever view them.
About the license fee Johnson informed the Committee that: "I urge you to find a more regressive system with regard to who most from it will get.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year - a huge sum, but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money, I wonder they think so because they're not really watching and listening to BBC.
Former Executive Director of Sky channels and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke before the Committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should reconsider the mission of Rita is to "inform, enlighten and entertain".
He said that now only a small part of the BBC material formally classified as educational - in his words, that 1% of TV content and 0.1% in radio and that the company should take over the Australian and canadian broadcasting companies under the motto "inform, enlighten and entertain".
For partnerships Elstein noticed that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "the Promenade concerts" (only some of them, according to him, shows on TV), but also enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
"Monogenetic" allows you to control brain cells using sound waves
The video clip shows how nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have deduced genetically modified worms with the nervous system, which can be managed using impulse sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction at a moment when they are exposed to sound impulses that are too high for the human ear to hear.
The pulse is influenced by activation of neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on topic: Researchers control brain activity using light
The scientists said that worms demonstrate the capabilities of a new technique called "monogenetic", the essence of which is the use of ultrasound to excite certain cells in the brain, heart and muscle, while the ultrasound source is located outside the body.
Srikant, Chalasani, research fellow at the Salk Institute, La JOLLA, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation is an invasive procedure in which the human brain sends electrical impulses and which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
A nematode worm usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they started to react when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles enhance the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the body of worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called "ion channels of TRP-4" found in the membranes of some cells of the worms.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled through ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of worms, so their motor neurons used ion channel TRP-4.
During the application of ultrasound to influence modified organisms sound waves amplified microscopic bubbles and introduced into organisms, worms, modified by activating motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in "optogenetic" - new direction, which allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with light pulses.
Chalasani argues that compared with this method sanogenetic may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the desired area of the brain via fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through body tissues, so shipping does not need to undergo inside the skull.
"We believe that to treat some neurological diseases clinical use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to make the human neurons are sensitive to the ultrasound signal," said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Banned torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements mock the British arms trade
See the video by Amnesty International to protest against the exhibition of arms.
Awesome killer robot drones!
Destroying the lower leg iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric stun batons, causing unbearable pain, but leaves no traces!
The cheerful voice and hand-drawn animation leave no doubt that this advertising the largest international exhibition of arms - a caustic parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the intention of the British government to sell arms to repressive regimes, taking place in the ExCeL centre in the Docklands exhibition of defense technologies and security systems.

But the campaign also leads to a sudden appearance of many posters on bus stops and in subway trains that require you to look at them again.
"Important announcement, coming on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" - written on one of them fonts London underground with the DLR line image, turning into the silhouette of the tank.
In September of this year, the crowd of arms dealers descend on the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help to prevent the exhibition of arms.
300 posters painted by artists who exhibited their works in the "Museum of cruel design" in the Park Banksy "Disbaled".
The band called the Group a "Special patrol" helped to distribute them around London, using "set cracker ad slots", 6-pound wrench set, which, it is claimed, "provides access to approximately one third of advertising space at bus stops of the planet."
London transport workers not fun of this "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody ads, released by the Group "Special patrol".
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of the exhibition Cruel Designs and a teacher at the University of Essex, the artists become more demanding and seek to bring political art to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists begin to work with activists of protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of their art, if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the arms exhibition, welcoming passengers on the subway.
Video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by the VCCP Agency, working pro bono, with the involvement of a graphic designer and dubbing artist, also working for free.
VCCP creative Director Matt lever was struck by the silence around advertising the exhibition of weapons, a pass in ExCel calendar - and thought, "let's take them on campaign, which they try to avoid".
They thought to create a more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but to "fill her house with bright colors and animation proved to be more exciting".
"They are incredibly helped us to draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davies from Amnesty.
Now we need the UK government took action and ensured that this torture equipment is not illegal to sell right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the theme of the exhibition of arms comes from within ExCeL, where participants trade euphemistically fantastic products.

Eight Golden rules of accommodation in dormitories
Already 11 years have passed since then, as I moved to a student dormitory like a normal 19-year-old man, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the strained smiles of those whom I've annoyed many and long complaints of others.
Basically, what I've learned, can be decomposed on eight simple rules.
Moving to a hostel can vary slightly from acting on the nerves to absolutely frightening.
It encourages people to talk: to tell people where you're from, whether you took a sabbatical and where it is spent, do you support Corbin and why do you "honestly, neither love nor hate "Marmite" because, seriously, guys, it's just yeast extract HAHAHA, I'll be".
Take a break.
And help other a break, too - ask questions and demonstrate interest.
It supports the conversation and helps you to find people who you like and not those that you would not even have bothered to talk, even if you lit up the eyelashes and they would be handing out the fire extinguishers.
Give the people space.
Rooms people often turn to drinking establishments, midnight cinema halls and places of General gatherings, but they are also a place where people dress and correct underwear.
More on topic: don't Even think about to start studying at the University, being in a relationship
To the introverts at universities are unfair.
Your bathroom should be a haven, but many of the hostels create the culture of the reel from one room to another that promotes friendship, communication and leads to a long friendship.
It may be hell for someone who is struggling to regain strength.
Nothing in the culture does not allow you to say: "I like You, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I want you gone, and I was able to recover the energy that I spent on communicating with you."
Try to feel when a classmate is tired of dealing - and not to knock for him, and send SMS.
By the way, about the knocking: do it.
One guy in my Dorm followed this principle: if the door wasn't locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends through baking.
As you begin University life at the peak of popularity of the show Bake-Off, to knock on the door for people to introduce themselves and to present a plate of chocolate biscuits is not such a strange action, so reminiscent of the 1950s, with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I have something baked, and now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions".
To offer homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and eventually, probably, your face will associate them with pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a Baker.
Poorly molded lumps of flour, sugar and fat is more likely to force people to pretend to be asleep when you get to them to knock.
Stealing food - the typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, assigning someone's chicken - stealing, but is it stealing to take a little bit of milk for tea?
Check with the owner of milk.
Most likely he will suggest you not to hesitate, even if the inside is boiling with rage.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I feel for you - but try to treat it more Mature than my roommate, which was poured in the milk the liquid for washing dishes, to take revenge on those who took without asking.
Now she's in jail.
You must not produce noise which will disturb people sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you and the people of sayings about glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to lower the sound of drum and bass because it was 3 a.m., and her morning exam.
In response, the neighbor has increased the volume.
When he finally stopped at 5 am, she graciously allowed him to sleep two hours, and then turned my music and locked the door behind him, going for a three-hour exam.
Not whether it was romantic, if your future spouse has lived in the same Dorm as you?
On the contrary, would it not be extremely, before biting elbows, awkwardly, if you took the neighbor at her future husband, got into it, broke up and would have to see him every day, and watch as he pulls on his side all of your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart wants - but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future husband, try to slightly cool the ardor of their own.
That exciting moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside the locked room of their own, the line between drawing and baiting is thinner than it seems.
A good drawing is fun, but turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Give valuable and interesting lesson on safety, hiding something - but never soil someone else's bathroom with toothpaste and shampoo.
Others lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't tape my other people's stuff glue Blu-Tack to the ceiling two more times.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on iPhone after update release from Apple
The new operating system can be queried by going to the Settings app, choose General, then Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install.
Some encounter problems after installation, when you receive an error message telling them that "application Update failed".
To avoid this, users are advised either to wait until the revival will cease, or try to update via iTunes.
Prompts on your phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase free space - but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action, reducing the size of the update, and also simplified the implementation by using a special tool, which offers to delete the app and re-re-install them after the process is complete.
You may want to ensure that when you upgrade your phone charged or you'll be near the charger to avoid low battery.
If the battery is low, Apple will stop updating because the phone is low in the process can cause upgrade to fail.

Washington responded to military activity of Russia by a phone call.
U.S. Secretary of state John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support Moscow provides to President Assad, leads only to aggravation of the conflict.
At the same time, the White house is not going to talk about it with his Russian counterpart, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of state John Kerry called Russian foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, to discuss military activity of Russia in Syria.
This edition of PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry made clear that continued support of President Assad on the part of Russia creates the risk of exacerbation and prolongation of the conflict and has a negative impact on our common goal - combating extremism, if not we will continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power", - said representatives of the U.S. state Department.
They also said that Kerry reiterated the U.S. commitment to the fight against "Islamic state" in the framework of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad can never be a member.
In addition, the U.S. "will welcome the constructive role played by Russia in attempts to thwart Islamic state".
Last Friday, White house officials said they do not know exactly the actions of Russian troops in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, White house press Secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the President decides that a phone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make this call".
Barack Obama himself believes Russia's decision to increase the support of the Assad regime "a losing bet".
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin for four or five years ago, when I told him that this is a mistake that continued support for Assad will only worsen the situation.
"But he did not heed my warnings and as a result the situation has worsened", - said the President of the United States.
Imported yachts will be exempt from the payment of customs duties.
The Ministry intends to release the temporarily imported yachts and other vessels for pleasure and sports from customs duties and taxes.
Appropriate changes to the list of privileged goods for temporary duty-free entry were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the government of the Russian Federation.
About this "news" said the assistant Minister for economic development Elena laskina.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the visit to Crimea has instructed a number of ministries - the Ministry of economic development, the Ministry of transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of culture, Ministry of foreign Affairs, EMERCOM, Federal security service, Federal customs service, the Federal tourism Agency - to prepare proposals on creation of favorable conditions for sailing in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete absence of infrastructure for storage, servicing and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - about €200 million annually would go into the coffers of European States for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of economic development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Eurasian economic Commission Council "On amendments to the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional release from payment of customs duties and taxes" providing full conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes on imported yachts and other vessels for leisure and sport.
According to the Ministry, it will certainly contribute to the creation of favourable conditions for yachting development in the coastal zones of the country, said laskina.
The matter was submitted for consideration by the sub-Commission on customs-tariff, non-tariff regulation and protective measures in foreign trade of the Governmental Commission on economic development and integration, the meeting was held in September, and following discussion, was also approved by the agencies.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of economic development, the proposed measure full conditional release at the time of importation is essentially a privilege.
Therefore, after approval of the minutes of the meeting of the sub-Commission in the government of the Russian Federation the Ministry of economic development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian economic Commission to discuss with member States of the EEU, said laskina.
In the list of imported goods which are fully exempted from payment of customs duties and taxes, includes the products needed to assist foreign trade and international cooperation, for use in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, international aid and others Among them - office equipment (personal computers, typewriters), instrumentation, drilling equipment, stage costumes and sets, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skiing, racing cars, bikes, sports aircrafts, books, Newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and items for religious ceremonies.
In a press-service of the Ministry of transport of the Russian Federation, "Izvestia" said that he had prepared stringent regulations on sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosiya and Evpatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for registration of entry and exit of small-sized, sports and pleasure boats in the seaport.
The transport Ministry has given orders to the captains of sea ports of the Crimea to ensure the application of simplified procedure of entering small-sized, sports and pleasure boats in sea port and output listed vessels from the port.
Also the Ministry of transport prepared the draft decrees of the RF government on approval of boundaries of water areas of sea ports of the Crimea.
In relation to the Yalta and Feodosia orders have already been taken, others are under negotiation, - said the press service of the Ministry.
In the opinion of the Ministry of transport, state supervision, classification and examination, state registration in respect of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes, must make the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia is extremely difficult with sailing because of poor infrastructure.
If you look to the South of Italy and France, there is a constantly growing industry involving a large number of people.
In Russia virtually all.
Our coast is not very interesting, the only piece where you can year-round to operate the yacht, is the Black sea in Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that in this area extremely strict rules of the border service in order for the boat to go for a walk, you need to issue a lot of permits.
Besides in Russia the yacht's nowhere to refuel.
Two days she can go with your fuel, and then there is a problem of where to take it, - says sales Director of the company-heliport Burevestnik: Denis Novikov.
As for places to store boats, then in Moscow and St. Petersburg now there are special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. the yacht is sent for storage in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that the buyers of the yacht - rich, however, with the beginning of the crisis the demand for boats declined.
The world Bank has provided Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The world Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for financial sector development.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The new funding will support a number of priority measures for reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine", - stated in the message.
World Bank Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Lmao Fang said that the reform of the banking sector will help to revive the credit in the real economy and will stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and at the world Bank see the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems of the fan urges the government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government has approved a loan of €100 million to Ukraine, reports "RIA Novosti".
Prisons are asked to create separate facilities for transgender people.
Public Council of the Federal service of execution of punishments (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicted in October of 2015, among other issues will discuss the possibility of establishing colonies in separate blocks for transgenders and transvestites.
This was "Izvestia" said a member of the Board Vladislav Grib.
In his opinion, depending on the total number of prisoners in Russia, not decided on floors, in domestic prisons it is possible to provide separate chambers, the blocks or even (if such criminals will be a lot) in the future to create for trannies special colony.
However, Vladislav Grib stressed that to determine the punishment of citizens in these isolated areas is possible only after the convicts will undergo the relevant medical examination that will prove that the offender is indeed a man identifying himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is sure that isolating transgender persons from other prisoners will ensure the safety of serving time.
According to him, the proposed practice successfully operated abroad: in prison (where the accused are before the court decision) there is a separate camera for transgender persons, and correctional agencies - special units.
Today it's the only way when dealing with such criminals.
Clearly they need to be isolated, as the presence of transvestite and transgender people in a normal camera it is dangerous for them, it's suffering for their families and a lot of problems for employees of the Federal penitentiary service.
Tranny humiliation by fellow inmates guaranteed, - said Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big the city, how many criminals with an uncertain flooring, you need to expect and where to distribute them.
Jail individual certainly don't need only camera, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a single colony is possible if transgender people will be a lot.
As explained by the Mushroom in the block may contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized body will be created in Russia alone, it is possible to do on completion of sentence prisoners shemales get from any regions.
Citizens are kept in jail on the crime scene, so the receipt of transvestites or transgender people from other actors during the investigation and judicial process unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for convicted in separate colonies - Yes, - said the Fungus.
We will remind, the day before law enforcement officers are unable to decide to what detention facility - male or female - identify detained for drug possession a 24-year old transsexual Dmitry Koukova (known under the name of Alina Davis), because of what the man from the maiden appearance was not arrested.
He was released home under a subscription about not departure.
This news was widely discussed in social networks and mass media as the mechanism of detention of transgender people in prisons in Russia really don't have.
Russian human rights activist, an activist of the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alexeev has supported the idea of creating special places for sentence serving transgender, noting that abroad it is also possible the determination of the colony - male or female - depending on their own desires.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the sentence correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as well as the issue of security in prisons for the safety of homosexuals, - said Alekseev.
Prisons must be safe, therefore, the individual blocks could be done in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially since they in prison more than transgender.
While Alekseev doubt that Russia will be a lot of people prepared to pretend to be transgender just to get into than a standard colony.
Of course, you can enter a medical examination before you put people in prison for transgenders, but not everything is unambiguous.
For example, in the U.S. one inmate Chelsea manning looked like a man, and in prison said he wanted to change his sex, - said Alekseev.
A person can feel most anything.
But while separate spots to serve sentences for transgender no, I doubt that the prison staff will think seriously about the safety of these people and delve into the intricacies of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lortkipanidze noted that introduction of new system of distribution of transgendered criminals in the colony can greatly delay the punishment of convicts.
A Commission is the question of sexuality, psychiatrists spend a long period of observation, this is not one test which is highly accurate conclusion.
Today psychiatry.
So before the sex-change potential patients are always such expertise - they just show whether a sex change with surgery is necessary, says Lordkipanidze.
However, I find it difficult to imagine how implementing this system towards the convicted, because on average the survey takes about a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that in General the idea of creating separate blocks for trannies supported, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new facilities, the medical examinations of transgender persons in the Russian one.
It is difficult to calculate, there is no official statistics, but when you consider that homosexuals in Russia about 5%, we can say that transgender even less, and those who have such a deviation and still commit crimes, even a small amount, said Lordkipanidze.
Now in asking the colony's administration homosexuals, transgender people can obtain individual conditions.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior world chess championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk ended the world chess championship among juniors up to 20 years.
The ending of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was decided in the last round, and became it Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed still to catch up with pole Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who seems to have confidently walked to the title.
Among girls the victory was celebrated by Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buksa.
The world chess championship, held from the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, by the middle of the League race, it seemed, had lost almost the whole affair, as a representative of Poland's Jan-Krzysztof Duda, issued a series of four wins (the competitions are held according to the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently took the lead.
Given that Duda was rating-favorite of the championship, and generally considered one of the most promising young players, the probability that he will miss the gap produced, seemed rather insignificant.
And even when the tune slowed down and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the gap to just 0.5 points, he remained a strong favourite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov, to catch up with the leader, you had to win in the 13th round.
But even that wouldn't help, Duda win their party.
Plus there's the obligatory victory, of course, could affect Russian chess player and lead to an error.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, and then was forced to wait when the party will finish Duda, who met with Benjamin Sideways.
Fortunately for Polish Antipova chess brought the confrontation with the Dutchman draw.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored equal number of points - 10 out of 13, but Antipova was the best additional indicators.
But because thanks to him the leadership of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous area Governor Natalya Komarova which traditionally pays great attention to chess development in the region, awarded the main prize.
And here in competitions of girls intriguing endings didn't happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalie Buchs (Ukraine) for winning the title was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russians Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with the upper part.
Russian athlete remained second behind the champion in 0.5 points.
VimpelCom changes the regional structure.
The company unites the Volga and Ural regions, one enlarged in the Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - the region East.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As noted by the General Director of "VimpelCom" Mikhail Slobodin, the changes are to "remain a strong player in the market", to develop the company "in the new, are not always favorable external conditions."
In an interview with TV channel "Russia 24" Mr. Slobodin said that they intend to reduce in Russia, "tens of percent" of the staff.
The CPS checked 78 Moscow eateries Burger King and gave 367 regulations.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volokolamsk highway was fined 50 thousand rubles., and the school on Bolshaya Tulskaya street was closed for 90 days but has resumed after the elimination of all violations.
43 eateries violated the requirements of the rooms.
Among other violations, unsatisfactory sanitary-technical and hygienic maintenance of premises, failure to comply with requirements for ventilation, in some institutions there were found bacteria of group of intestinal sticks.

Comfortable rate for investkredit - 10-13%.
According to experts, the market of crediting of small and medium business in January-April this year declined by 40%.
What, in your opinion, what is the situation today?
After the panic in late 2014 - early 2015 lending to SMEs has decreased significantly.
The reason is obvious: the sharp rise in interest rates.
Lending at 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
If earlier the Bank could lay at an increased rate all their possible problems in the future, from arrears to defaults, and now it is impossible to do: rates are sky-high.
For business the current level of interest rates on loans to SMEs is uncomfortable.
For a considerable part of investment projects the current level unacceptable from the point of view of their return.
The level of interest rates in 10-13% would allow the business to invest in a broad range of projects and shaping them attractive returns.
How, in your opinion, meeting the demand of entrepreneurs for loans?
After dropping Central Bank interest rates, the situation is slightly improved.
Credit resources became more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to ask for loans, much less.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects of development and future revenues.
Today, the business has one way out: need to work on, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
Need to be monitored more closely by the current results, to control cash flow.
At the same time, subject to availability of financial resources is to use new technology to upgrade equipment, reduce production costs and energy supply.
All this, ultimately, allows the company to make the products more competitive and to retain business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends of SME lending market will be strengthened and will influence its development until the end of 2015?
Whether to change the interest rate?
The forecast reduction in the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the knob shows the sequence in question lowering key rates.
However, a drastic fall in the price of credit to SMEs can be expected.
In the current situation, the problem in the first place, is inflation, which makes necessary an increased interest rate to obtain real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even at lower rates by the Central Bank.
If we talk about the level of delay, traditionally small and medium business limited in the ways of topping up of funds, and in versions correction of economic behavior, of course, will represent a greater risk to lenders.
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the proportion of bad loans.
The main reason is that international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy.

Kiev broke off nuclear Union.
Kiev has formalized the refusal of Ukraine from cooperation with Russia on completion of Khmelnitsky NPP.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday at the second attempt voted for termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Agreement on completing the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but to start a project and failed.
On Wednesday the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted the law, terminating concluded in 2010-2012, the agreement with Russia on the construction of the third and fourth blocks at Khmelnitsky NPP.

Negotiations with Moscow on the completion resulted in 2010 to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement, in 2011-2012, the Rada has adopted relevant laws.
Because funds in the budget of Ukraine was not, it was assumed that the building blocks have to credit the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries in Kiev began to cease relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, having announced its refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsky NPP and the construction project in the Ukraine a nuclear fuel plant.
The only area where relations are preserved, left procurement in the Russian Federation fuel for nuclear power plants in Ukraine (provides about half of electricity generation in the country), as long as the Ukrainian NAEK "Energoatom" to replace Russian supplies nothing.
From plans to completion of Khmelnitsky NPP with another company in the Ukraine until I finally refused: even in 2014, in Kiev was declared the negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.

However, the lawyer of the Duma Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of the "Communists of Russia" contrary to the law.
FedEx revenue was a mixed, lowering forecasts to 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results last quarter, and the giant delivery service has reduced the forecast of annual profit due to falling demand for trucking services and increased costs in its unit surface transport.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this same time last year FedEx announced that it will hire 50 000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in the previous auction in 45 minutes before the market opens on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn from $10,40 to $10.90 per fiscal year, which ends next may, which is 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10,84 according to a survey by FactSet.
The forecast decline is observed despite the increase in rates on average by 4.9 per cent, which will come into force on 4 January, and the increase in charges for inland transportation of heavy or large cargoes, which begins in November.
The company said it still expects revenue growth compared to last year due to a reduction in costs, increase gross revenue and growth of online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "has worked steadily with weakness, compared with the forecast, economic conditions, particularly in production and world trade".
Plans to hire personnel during the holidays were announced on the day after the announcement of a competitor, UPS, that they plan to hire additional 95 000 employees, about as many as were recruited last year.
For the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $ 692 million, 6 percent higher than a year earlier.
Earnings per share amounted to 2,42 dollars, close to the forecast average of 2.44 dollars per share, Zacks Investment Research conducted a survey of 12 analysts.

The most anticipated in several years the meeting, the heads of the Federal reserve system will spend two days this week for 27-foot table out of Honduran mahogany, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly ten years.
At one end of the ornate meeting rooms of the height of two floors above them will hang a wall picture of the United States.
This card is a reminder that the Chairman of the Federal reserve system Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank got a double order of Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to maintain stable prices.
But since the great recession, the heads of the Federal system has recognized that there is a third, unwritten order: financial stability.
This is the third instruction may be an unknown factor in almost predicted the decision will be announced on Thursday, to see whether the U.S. economy is to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by near zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Even though most of the data show a steady growth of the economy, recent turmoil in global financial markets may hold already cautious of the heads of Federal systems from adding volatility by raising the base of the Federal funds rate - even by just a quarter percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important consideration," said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, which increased uncertainty around the global market was enough to give them an excuse to wait on," she said.
There is no consensus about what will make the Federal reserve system, which in itself provokes fluctuations of the financial market.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg, predicted a rise in interest rates this week.
Financial markets expect that the Federal system will hold that the key indicator shows only about 30-percent chance of a quick recovery.
This can lead to the collapse of the stock market, if the Federal system will raise your bid, provided that those who make decisions, will not soften the blow with a promise that the next increase will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones rose by 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599,85.
The rise was triggered by expectations that the persons defining the strategy of the Federal system, to remain unchanged this week, said John Lonski, the group's chief economist, Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"Be surprising if the Federal system will raise rates at this point of time," he said.
If the Federal reserve will do, "they have far to go in adopting its strategy to keep the financial markets in hand, so they did not panic".
Other experts argued that the rate increase could reassure the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal system.
Just a month ago, a Federal system seems to be inclined to raise the rate by 0.25 % this month, taking a first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that it expects a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals about the need for greater economic progress.
Although the emergence of new jobs in August slowed the growth of the labor market was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years, and nearly on the level that the Federal system is considered to be full employment.
Wage growth shows signs of accelerating.
And although inflation remains below the Central Bank planned annual index of 2%, the Federal system has said that a key reason was the temporary effect of a sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher stakes and need them, with the contraction of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
Average the Dow Jones industrial companies fell by as much as 16% compared to a record high in may, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could slow global growth.
The market partly recovered its position this month, and the Dow Jones is now about 10% below the may high value.
For the management of the Federal reserve system the indignation of the market further complicates the difficult calculations of the period of rising interest rates.
"In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about weakness in the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have to tighten the screws at this meeting," said Steven D. Oliner, senior fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal reserve system.
Now, he predicted, they will have to wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
"There is great uncertainty in what might be the consequences for the U.S. economy, and they have almost no reliable information on the recent events in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not included in the major preoccupations of the Federal system, and technically it should not be considered when making these decisions.
But essentially the Federal reserve became a world financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been huge.
Only one hint from the then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal reserve can "mute" their monetary expansion has caused the turmoil of the markets all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies increasingly intertwined, one would expect that the heads of the Federal reserve system will not only monitor the development of events elsewhere, but also to consult with representatives of other Central banks and with experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc - a company engaged in the global strategies of wealth management.
Jeffrey Lacker, President, Federal reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said this month that "in the history of the Federal reserve system resulted in over-reacting to the movements of the financial market, which, it seems, are not bound to economic principles".
Lacker, a voting member of the influential Federal open market Committee, insisted on raising rates, in the cited decision 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia has led to the fact that the Federal system has reduced its base rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the limited identifiable impact on growth in the U.S.," said Lacker.
A year later, the heads of the Federal system abolished this reduction.
The Federal reserve system should be put in the first place care about stability only in times of great crises such as the collapse of the market in 2008," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee on rate-setting Bank of England.
Latest panic and comes close to that level, he said.
"You would certainly not want to be in a situation where you are afraid of the growth rates due to the fact that the markets are experiencing turmoil," said Posen, President of the Institute for international Economics. Peterson.
The law on Federal reserve system still has a dual mandate with no mention of financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should jump the gun.

The Brazilian Union of pediatricians of Rio Grande promotes healthy eating for breastfeeding
Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS came up with the scandalous method by which is going to persuade women of the necessity of nutrition during breastfeeding: a method includes displaying images of babies sucking Breasts, painted with images of unhealthy food.
In the composition of breast milk includes various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, of which children receive all the nutrients they need to build strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs of pregnant and postnatal women it is recommended to increase daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, a recent study shows that the increase of the caloric content is not the only change in diet that a mother needs to do.
In a recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a Professor at the medical College Baylor in Texas, it was found that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, it was revealed the negative impact of unhealthy diet on the immune system of the child.

The battle for one of the regional titles in the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57,15 kg, last Friday, ended with the victory Magali knockout in the 12th round.
Brown was hospitalized with a traumatic brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to life support.
On a professional ring brown scored 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one fight ended in a draw.
He is survived by two children.
This is the second case of lethal outcome among Australian boxers in the past six months.
In March from injuries sustained in the ring, died 23-year-old student Braydon Smith.
The AMA now recommends not to engage in this sport, and better, from her point of view, or even ban it altogether.
I understand that this happens unintentionally, - said the Vice-President of the organization Steven Parnis. -
But in the form in which now there is Boxing, always will be situations when an athlete receives a haemorrhage or brain injury that leads either to death or to serious injury.
For this reason, the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.

Sergey Naryshkin called upon the OSCE PA to cancel the sanctions against parliamentarians of the Russian Federation.
The speaker of the state Duma Sergey Naryshkin called unacceptable the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said this, speaking at the session of the OSCE parliamentary Assembly in Ulaanbaatar.
We estimate this as an invalid operation, like the attack on the value of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this must not happen again, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue," - said the politician.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the participants of the OSCE PA to the restoration of partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's bring back morality into politics.
Let's get the dialogue right and the practice of international communication.
Let's get humanistic ideals in a democratic world order.
"The hypocrisy never anything good did not end," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the parliamentary Assembly, speaker of the Russian Duma called upon the parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
Encourage members to focus on the following specific tasks in ensuring security.
"First of all, on the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convocation of our parliamentary group," said Naryshkin.
He also noted that we must pay tribute to the OSCE.
"It's almost the only common ground, where we discuss how to normalize the situation in Ukraine", - said the politician.
We will remind, the autumn session of the parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15th, in Ulaanbaatar, and runs until 18 September.
Panikadila had victory a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergey SHUBENKOV.
He succeeded to his crown race 110-meter hurdles to win the team championship of Europe, set a few records, and most importantly - to become a world champion, and the first in the history of the barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of "Diamond League", taking overall third place.
"Novye Izvestiya" Shubenkov asked to share impressions of the past season.
Sergey, the season is not over yet?
Yes, going to speak at the World military games which will be held October in Korea, and then we'll think about the rest.
However, to prepare now will be home in Barnaul, and to be home is quite another condition.
It's easier than every week to wander around the world.
You once said that autumn is a favorite time of year for you.
The end of August, beginning of September is a great time.
Passion after the main start of the season ottepeli, the burden of responsibility no longer affected.
You can compete in fun, "chill".
Plus I know that a vacation very soon...
And fatigue?
All-season special, a lot of positive emotions...
Fatigue by the end of the season always builds up.
And then it does not matter that doing more is won or lost.
Each competition is stressful.
Continuous flights, travel - all this is not for the body without a trace.
Tired physically and emotionally.
But now the emotions I have, of course, is on the rise.
I couldn't be happier.
When finished at the world Championships in Beijing, back often?
Happen.
And you, journalists, do not give me forget.
But I think he is a bad athlete, who lives the old victories, scrolls your successful races over and over again.
Panikadila had victory a couple of days and need to move on.
The preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
Can't say that was something special.
To prepare we started back in December, but the winter competition season I missed.
Trained first at home in Barnaul, then in training camp, then home again.
As usual.
But with the coach set a task: to try to reach a new level at which I was not.
Almost all winter spent to lay the Foundation.
They came in a bunch of crosses, made some exercises on General physical training, which included deadlifts and squats, and back we pumped.
Then began preparation for the barrier, has a lot of equipment.
How are the opponents, followed?
I always try to do, the benefit in the Internet age this is no problem.
Looked at the winter championship, and there in barrier sprint the whole pedestal was taken by the French.
Thought: need to do something, to dilute this company.
With each start this season, you added and improved results.
It gave us confidence?
I have all the recent seasons are formed in approximately the same scheme.
There is no such that I run first, 13,20, and then 13,50.
Always hyping its shape gradually.
The main thing that I wanted to do is run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was primarily aimed at this result.
But the paradox is that I feel that I am ready on feats, and at competitions to show your commitment does not always work.
As it was, for example, at the Olympics in London?
I, frankly, the semifinal heat (Shubenkov failed to qualify for the final. - "NO") tried to forget immediately.
Ready was very good, really could run out of 13 seconds.
Yes, even if repeated his best result at that point would be a bronze medalist.
But no such luck.
His first world Cup you remember?
What about?
In Daegu it was.
I really wanted to get into the final, was such a program-maximum.
And fell off right from the morning preliminary races.
I then realized that a tear and a headlong rush - so no recourse.
Two years later at the world Championships in Moscow have already reached the final with the best time.
Can remember the feeling before the decisive race: I really wanted to win "gold"!
As possible, developing a decent speed, not to lose his head, do not disconnect?
But this is the most difficult.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technique not to bring down the barriers.
Noticed that when configured not on results but on the process so much easier.
And the buzz when you have the feeling that running away and all seemed to come naturally!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the provinces after the first major successes tend to move closer to the capital.
Never had such thoughts?
Home is still best.
Yes and no idea where I am without his coach, who wants me?
Maybe it would be good to have better terms, but I try to be happy with what you have.
C Klicovym long have you been together?
With 12 years since then, both in athletics came.
More precisely, I first practiced his wife, who worked with the children, and then she gave me.
I started out with sprint, then long jumped, triple.
Kids all-around it is when you toss the ball, jump in length from place...
14 tried the hurdles, and I liked it.
From the first race turned out to qualify for the second adult category.
And left.
Fear of barriers was never?
Somehow just happened to agree with them.
But the technique always had to work very much.
Over over one dispersal how many suffered!
But this routine can not escape.
The technique need to constantly hone - to night I could Wake up, I immediately got up and ran through the barriers.
All who saw the race in Beijing, argue that it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I enjoyed it.
I usually do not revise their races, and then could not resist.
But over the efficiency you need to continue to work - there is no limit to perfection.
Now I'm not afraid that the victory a year before the Olympic games will fall on the shoulders of a heavy load?
As they say in such cases, try to meet the expectations.
Time chose this road, so have to go to the end.
My coach likes to say: if you're not a wimp, no extra load needs not to feel.
And I absolutely agree.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well I am not that naive that I was led into a surprise reaction to an interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, they do not feed bread - give, toss the enemy.
And although I'm not a flag wrapped, the same, exactly the same, I told you countless times here, directly and the bastard didn't call me more hurt.
All my pseudoplusia in a moment, in a moment had vanished.
The pressure that I'm experiencing, is so strong that even I, old boy, I think that people drinking the Kool-aid.
If he was walking, was walking, and you're attacked by a mob, punch rods.
But one should know me, I'm not the eagle room, my fist, I'm from howitzers will hit, I'm old, guys, be afraid.
Another thing is no support.
My illusions were not, and now...
The best in me has always been self-sufficiency, so bite me.
But to give passports to such freaks like Fred durst or Monson, I can only assholes.
It would be better for me, the best journalist work not shameful.
A week ago in Kiev Otar Kushanashvili bluntly described the events in Crimea:
What he did with the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That is called annexation.
I assume that the reference to how drunken Khrushchev were trying to sign, do not fit into the overall picture of the human community.
This is how to come to the neighbor and pick up his living space...
War the Kremlin has gone, and it will end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, as in the summer of 2008, it started with a call some bastard out of the dungeon of the Kremlin.
I have no idea who it could be...
Kobzon is not too much left to live.
I don't understand, he is the greatest artist, why would he need to lick the hands of Putin.
Is he gonna lose?
Well, demolished a monument to him.
Of course, people remembered it as insulting to their small home.
But reconciliation now only Mr Putin depends.

Four were killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal, when the police began shooting rubber bullets into the crowd, protectyou against the proposed new Constitution, as stated by the official representative on Wednesday.
The violence happened on Tuesday night in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles West of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.

Mr. dhakal was reported that police used tear gas, then shot into the air, before you resort to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets, which, as we know, can kill, however, they are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative that caused such a high mortality rate.
This clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in the South, the plains of Nepal, where representatives of the people of madhesi claim that new province, formed under the new Constitution, will reduce their political influence.
Protests were also held in the West of Nepal, among the citizens of the nation, Tara, who want to have their own state.

August, when four major political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces, which was a decisive step towards a new Constitution, however, a very contentious issue in Nepal, which is centrally managed for several centuries.
Work on the new Constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that claimed the lives of thousands of people in April.

Sayansk is planning to establish a facility at 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest town in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70-ies of the last century as a center of chemical industry, has a developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, the office was headed by the new mayor - Oleg Borovskiy.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects, he has told to the correspondent "Regional".
Oleg Valeriyevich, why you have begun work as mayor?
First of all, I reviewed the results of inspections of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit examination of the expenditure of the local budget.
Then performed an audit of the municipal property.
One of the first practical steps was the reduction of documents to five days.
Previously the courts could walk for months.
Have been developed activities to increase the revenue base and optimising expenditure.
In November last year in saiansk held a government meeting where they discussed the socio-economic development of the territory.
The city does not have design and estimate documentation (DED) for a single object.
Without this Sayansk was not able to participate in Federal programs.
We started with the preparation of DED for the road, a kindergarten, a Northern sewer and water line.
Now roadworks on two sections is already underway.
In the city is the presidential decree about building kindergartens?
In July of this year in saiansk 105 kids were born.
Such positive demographics in the city have not been observed for the past 27 years.
So the question of availability of places in kindergartens today, one of the most relevant.
September 1 closed for capital repair of kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repairs - 86 million roubles.
Such funds of the city still never received.
Last year, after the repair has opened a kindergarten № 23, which is now visited by 200 children.
Repairs were made on the conditions of co-financing from regional and local budgets, the cost amounted to over 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and assistance of the regional government also allocated funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and helped the program "National initiative".
There are plans to start in 2016 construction of a new kindergarten.
With his input, we plan to eliminate the sequence of children aged from one and a half to three years.
Queues for children from three to seven years we do not.
Investors are showing interest in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city needs to do, first of all, Sayan enterprise, they need to provide.
In October commissioned a 60-apartment house for orphans in the district of Leningrad.
As for construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of the Irkutsk region, which was included in the programme for construction of houses of economy class.
All the necessary documentation prepared.
The construction of the 90 block sections will begin soon.
We just announced the construction of 10 thousand square meters of housing Willing to participate in the program very much.
A housing should be no more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this price includes finishing "turnkey".
If we can cope with given volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
In my time on site was built Sayan pig farm, which in 2004 was sold for a pittance.
We work with the Prosecutor's office to protest this transaction.
Moreover, the land is in Federal ownership.
Work is underway with Moscow, the question on transfer of 88 ha in the regional property, with the subsequent transfer of the land to the municipality.
Have a potential investor ready to invest in reconstruction and launching of the project is 1.5 billion rubles.
With the launch of pig farm we will have 900 jobs that will be for the town of great help.
In saiansk developed the Institute of social partnership?
We have signed 140 contracts for socio-economic partnership.
Many projects succeeded thanks to an active social position business representatives.
Tangible support is provided by such enterprises as CJSC "East-Center", new-Ziminsky thermal power station, LLC "Sayan broiler", LLC "PC MDF", the management of these enterprises responds to all requests.
Directly to the city Day, LLC "Sayan broiler" gave the city a children's Playground, the company "East-Center" carried out the renovation of the equestrian courtyard, where specialists teach children ipoterapii, while spending over 1 million rubles.

Was released city chronicle, book Sayan poets.
First builders and people who have made a serious contribution to the development of Sayansk, awarded with commemorative medals.
Patrons will also participate in the work of city charity Fund.
The first step was the purchase of instruments for young talented musicians.
For the first nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles were allocated to support talented children, to help children who need expensive treatment, supporting children from low-income families.
How to deal in saiansk staffing problems in the social sphere?
There aren't enough doctors and the teachers.
To address the human resource issue is crucial to the provision of housing specialists.
Over the past year, we have identified five apartments for doctors, housing got four teachers.
We have a programme for the allocation of housing with the option to privatize within five years.
The plans include the redevelopment of the building, which will be built eight apartments for teachers.
Also teachers and doctors participate in the program "Housing for Russian family".
In perspective - construction of houses for public sector employees.
Most importantly, the city has a healthy team with which I can solve the most complex issues.
It is important of all the crises to draw the right conclusions, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region great.

Diabetics with slight obesity, can help obesity surgery
Beneficial effects after bariatric surgery in people with slight obesity, diabetes type 2, can last at least five years, according to a new study.
Now, however, it is too early to say that diabetics with slight obesity, live longer after bariatric surgery than those who receive nonsurgical treatment.
"Mortality statistics is manifested not once," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, wrote about a new study in the column editor of JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses different techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the capacity of organized utilization of food.
For several years bariatric surgery proved effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the main research was conducted among people with morbid obesity who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight for height, is considered normal if the value is from 18.5 to 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher suggests that a person overweight, and people with BMI above 30 are considered obese people.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from the Taiwan hospital Min-Sheng General used data collected from 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy with medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with moderate obesity.
Mean BMI in those who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, the BMI of those who received nonsurgical treatment of diabetes, remained at around 29.
Among those who had surgery, completely recovered from diabetes 36%, and 28%.
In the group treated with medication, for comparison, complete recovery from diabetes was observed only in 1%, and a partial - only about 2%.
In addition, the blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "in General were better in the surgical group," say the authors.
The researchers also monitored the levels of hemoglobin A1C in blood, which reflect the levels of blood sugar in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to keep below 7%, write the researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But the best indicators of glycemic control, reflected good levels of hemoglobin A1c, not reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to the head of research of Dr. Chi-Cheng su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, in comparison with the group polchischa sleeve gastrectomy, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), has achieved a larger decrease in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1C (3.1% vs. 2.1 percent) and was closer to complete remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent against 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of surgery in terms of survival after five years, there is evidence on the results of a study of people with overweight in Sweden that surgical treatment is indeed leading to the increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone College of medicine in Phoenix, AZ, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study, for people with obesity, choosing bariatric intervention, the probability of dying during 15 years was about 29% lower compared with the group which used more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encourages people with BMI below 35 who are interested in this procedure.
"The report is very important because it argues that such surgery is safe in the group with low BMI, where there is no increased risk of mortality or renal diseases," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors need to start seriously weight once the BMI of a patient is within the range between 27 to 30.
"I think we wait too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that as soon as they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger in their bodies obesity and diabetes, pay it back very hard.
In Mytischi the robbers took away from the house coats and 9 million roubles.
In Mytishchi robbers attacked the residents of a suburban home and stole 9 million rubles, and three women's fur coats.
On it informs "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Ministry of internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unidentified men through the open front door entered the house, located on Gorky street, tied up 20-year-old son of the mistress of the house and threatened both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles, and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand roubles, criminal case is raised under article "Robbery".
Fans from Europe at risk of being homeless.
Only 23 of the St. Petersburg hotel, you are entitled to host tourists in 2018 will come to see the world Cup.
The rest of do not hurry to obtain a permit.
According to experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
On the eve of the world championship, the authorities urgently need to figure out how to accommodate all guests.
The interlocutors of "Rosbalt" believe that because of the tournament the cost of the rent rental apartments will grow by 10-30%, and after the championship for a rented accommodation have to pay.
The world Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the condition of Russian hotels.
By law, written specifically for the championship, each hotel Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure, and to prove that you meet the stated number of stars and level of service.
It is already clear that it'll be possible not to all: hoteliers are so afraid of the checks that often do not even send the documents to the requests of the Federal Antimonopoly service in St. Petersburg.
As told the head of the OFAS Vadim Vladimirov, the Agency examined the 138 hotels, and now plans to bring 34 cases against hotels, many of which are simply not answered back.
There are signs that the leadership of the three dozen companies cheated the citizens, placing a certain amount of stars in advertising, said Vladimirov.
The problem is that now literally every room, none need to lose before 2018.
Officials suspect that during a football championship the fans will take all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in this city, tourists can expect to 30,5 thousand rooms.
According to Smolny, St. Petersburg in 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotel and 100 two - and three-star, 550 - one-star.
According to the first Deputy of the Committee on development of tourism Nana Guichi, at the moment the classification were only 23 of all inspections conducted by accredited in St. Petersburg company.
But has anyone ordered any hotel of this procedure in the regional enterprises, the Smolny by amazing coincidence, is unknown.
That is past the classification may be more, but nobody knows about it.
"The last six months, hotels are not sought to be classification", - declared the Director of the northwestern branch of the Russian Union of travel industry Catherine Shadskiy.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers make more money and don't want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets, which included the costs of verification, the procedure may cost the hotel depending on the status from 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
But in recent times the management of the hotels has intensified and began to apply for the classification, assured Shadskiy.
The hotels must be done before July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but will not be eligible to work in the world Cup.
We already know that depending on the star will be developed fixed charge for a room in the hotel for the duration of the tournament.
The formula, which will be calculated the cost, will publish next year.
This is done in order to prevent the rise in prices by 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg economic forum.
You have to have conscience and to prevent the increase in two or three times, but the hotels need to make.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%", - said the President of the Russian hotel Association Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov I'm not sure that fixing prices in line with the notion of a market economy.
I don't know how this fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better than rampant price increase", - he noted.
It is not clear what will be popular with cheap hostels.
The state Duma introduced a bill according to which hostels should be banned in homes.
I really hope that this law will not be adopted or will not touch St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels should be saved," - says Nana Guache.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case have to be ready to tighten Housing code.
If the state Duma all-taki will approve the bill, then in St. Petersburg will close about 80% of the hostels, and at the moment there are 1.5 thousand numbers.
According to the President of the Federation of restaurateurs and hoteliers of the North-West of Leonid Garbar, St. Petersburg lacks two - and three-star hotels, which are in demand by football fans, but there is a bias towards hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is analogous to the situation when "on 80-thousand stadium, sitting 75 thousand VIPs".
This can be corrected through mini-hotels.
Their possible ban, the expert believes a "ridiculous": "I find it strange that some people can live in apartments, but visitors for some reason I can't."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that it is wrong.
But if you like a hotel in which guests arrive for a short period, then why not?
Mini-hotels risk missing the world Cup and because of its sluggishness.
Hundreds of small hotels just don't have time to go through classification, and digging a pit for themselves.
By the summer of 2016 book work will all hotels in the city.
"Companies that can conduct the procedure not as much, so they will abandon the lower-paid orders from small hotels, and will choose those that are more expensive," - said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in some cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, indicators of passed inspections at the moment, St. Petersburg is much higher.
The reason for the delay was St. Petersburg including constant changes in the tourism unit of government that is not conducive to the coordinated work.
According to experts, if the St. Petersburg hotels is not enough for all that most likely will have to pay attention to regional hotels and rest houses.
For example, the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, the city can mobilize the river fleet, are guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will come prepared on the vans, in which it will be possible to spend the night.
"The main thing is not to set so many hotels, so they were empty," - said Gennady Lamshin.
Also very popular during the football championship will use a rented accommodation.
Most likely the city will create a pool of rental apartments.
Rental rates will grow by 10-30%.
"From the obvious - leaving the first housing near the stadium", - said the specialist rental Agency of development and researches in real estate, Larisa Bragina.
And the price may not return to the previous level after the world Cup, especially in residential areas.
This will contribute to the construction of new interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she said.
Do not forget about the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar am sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city where people don't just tell you the way, but can still hold a mini-tour.
There are also complications.
My father in year 1970, in the yard met a family from Murmansk - father, mother and two children.
It was the place to stay: with hotels was difficult then, at the train station to sleep hard.
"And dad brought them in our communal apartment to sleep," recalled the source.
However, he added that such traits in the inhabitants of the city left to call home is fraught with consequences and scared.
But maybe in 2018, after an unsuccessful decisions of the state Duma, mistakes hoteliers and governments have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky lost the Amur region.
With admiration today looked at the clown Zhirinovsky in the state Duma.
He had done these things when our generation still learned to sell Newspapers, and is still in great shape.
His topic, like, "the liberal democratic party protest against results of elections in the Amur region".
Protocols not shakes - for nothing; other protocols, also signed by the election commissions, the liberal democratic party, apparently not.
Here he lifts the runner-up Ivan Abramov and yells something like: "Here is the winner of the election!"
And then I pounced on Rodnina, and then, after the altercation with the presiding judge, leads a faction from the courtroom, yelling, literally, "You all with your fronts are crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, makes the emphasis not on Abramova, and to the scandal and the demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
Really beautiful and elegant Wolfowitz leaked the Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole country this is just another one of Zhirinovsky in the style of "Scum!", not a political party protest against the results of a particular election.
And the faction formally quarreling, and elections, according to the party website and Facebook Ivan Abramov, is not recognized, but the leader with the theme obviously peel off.
Provides dead-on-Amur to bury their own dead, and he preaches against the "United Russia" in General and innocent Rodnina.
Elegant solution to the face and not to lose, and in a real, not ostentatious scandal not to go.
Another thing is that now in a strange position and it turns itself Abramov.
In addition to the screams from his superiors, he did not wait, of the alternative protocols on hand no.
He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and for a narrow circle it was a formal occasion and to insult a respected champion, and, even cooler, boorish attacks on the onf and EP.
And then he, of course, need to think very seriously what to do.
Because of the main beneficiary of the elections, politics number 2 and number 1 candidate on one-mandatory only regional district it can turn into a pariah who has successfully used private party leadership and the super-stimulus for the popular front and the party leadership of someone else.
That's for sure - there would be no Zhirinovsky, it should come up and respectfully watching him.
Trump to it still to grow and grow.
Came the news that the liberal democratic party will return to the hall during the next plenary meeting.
That is, the bath fell anything at all.
The only theme Abramova a buried.
Beautiful really.
"It's impossible to come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot take all the refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in the homeland of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Center of compassion the Dalai Lama in Oxford devoted to research ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that in existing circumstances the interests of humanity must be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that although it is admired, the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate to the situation.
"It neozmozhnye that all came to Europe", - he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised by the German and Austrian actions in response to the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
"Caring for thousands of refugees, fine, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, in this Muslim country," he said.
In the end, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, saying that the harsh reaction by the US has launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
A four-fold increase in the number of children who swallowed disinfectant for the hands, for the last 4 years
Poison centers in the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age, swallowed a disinfectant for hands with a high alcohol content, as reported by the poison center of the state of Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the poison centre of Georgia, the cases of ingestion by children under 12 years of liquids for disinfecting hands, were reported to poison centers increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children come into contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately, a certain percentage of them goes to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink the disinfectant fluid on purpose and some do it to impress their friends, or to dispute for social networks.
The videos on Youtube you can see how the teenagers are drinking the disinfectant liquid as the cheap booze.
Reportedly, teenagers were mixed with disinfectant liquid liquid alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
The younger children can bring pleasant smells of disinfectant.
"The child doesn't think it could hurt him" - said Lopez.
Many of the most attractive (disinfectant liquid for hands) - those that are scented.
There is a liquid disinfectant for hands with a smell of strawberry, grape, orange, are very attractive to children.
Disinfectant liquid for hands contains anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially, just a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is the high concentration of alcohol," he told Fox 4 in Kansas city Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician, poison centre at the hospital of the University of Kansas.
You wouldn't have left if just a glass of whiskey, but people keep in mind these hand sanitizers, and if children come at them, this is a quick way to consume large amounts of alcohol.
Naija Russell, six year old girl that recently the school had swallowed disinfectant for hands with a strawberry flavour in an amount of about four sprays, was sent for treatment in the emergency Department.
The level of alcohol in her blood was 179, two times more than that of an adult who, by law, is in a state of alcoholic intoxication, according to Dr Chris Ritchie - an emergency room doctor who treated her in the medical center Gwinnett near Atlanta.
Naija confused words and could not walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
The doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic not to miss any signs of a brain injury because of alcohol the girl fell and hit her head, said Ritchie.
"It was very scary," he told CNN Artoria Scott, mother Naiji.
It could be fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use nesperova of the substance or disinfectant wipes, in addition, in order to remove disinfectant liquid for hands out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluid has been associated with the deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol - a deadly agent, and not ethyl alcohol, which was listed as active substance.
In January three students-fourth-grader in Northern new York conspired to poison them "nasty" by the teacher "distribution of antimicrobial agents in the class," according to the police report.
The teacher had a strong Allergy to disinfectants for hands, and it forbade to keep them in class.
The police believes that the plan failed was "empty chatter", and addresses disciplinary issues to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back bench at the entrance to the regional children's library. N. To. Krupskaya sad cast iron owl.
The kids who come for the books, trying to feed her sweets.
For several generations, and goes to the library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twenties of the last century staged here loud readings, staged performances on the poetry of Mayakovsky, conducted literary quiz and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
Correspondence lasted four years, and, as he wrote in 1939, the newspaper "Young Stalinist" every day "friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends children's library in the city of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna sent even once Barnaul distant friends my picture as a baby.
Barnaultsy and when asked, doesn't mind a Krupskaya, the library was named her name, wrote that no, objects.
Letter long been gathering dust in a Museum, and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers I have to explain, whose stern profile is decorated with a bas-relief on the building of the library.
In the years of perestroika are often called different people, were indignant: why to the children's library is not renamed?
Let it be the library name of some good children's writer, without any political coloration!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave things as they are.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as the "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - the path of yellow brick.
"The wizard of oz" - a favorite theme of the artist Oli coal Tits.
Previously, she was Manager at a law firm, went to work at eight, leave at five, and from all other managers differed only in the love for drawing.
And then I found in the web ad: "Need an Illustrator for books".
Book wrote a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "my mom Has cancer."
Olga did the illustrations, and thought: life can end at any time, and any miracles it won't, if you don't have to create them myself.
Now she works in a library, illustrates children's book writers all over the world and writes stories.
Traditionally it is believed that children lose interest in the book that they increasingly live in a virtual space...
But we do go reading children and their parents understand the value of reading, says "the Russian planet" library Director Tatiana Kushvid.
In recent years we have even had a moment of confidence that the children's library needs, and she will live - children-go here!
I think interest in reading is returned.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained glass window with updated photo exposition.
Every quarter posted new photos of readers who go to the library with the whole family: mom, dad and children.
In the library rejoice that the children are increasingly began to come dad.
If in two years the child read all of Chukovsky, at an older age he needs a more advanced book.
But now there is a law by which eight-year-old Prodigy is prohibited to issue books from the category 12+.
To get such a book, the child must bring their parents with them - they come, then back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" is becoming something of a family club.
In the library there are treasures of the pre - revolutionary collection of folk tales from the aisle and erami, stories Korolenko in the Annex to the magazine "Niva" newspaper "Murzilki" for 1936.
After all, we now not only conceptual space "temple of books", we are now open to traffic, we are trying to become a special place: not home, not work, not school, explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can visit us to get together to read, play, draw.
We made a play area for kids - a child comes to play, but the hand still reaches for the book!
Some of our readers parents take, and they rested legs, I don't want to leave.
Often mothers with prams - and we are pleased that the library they put on the first place among all other places should come with kids.
Tatiana Kushvid says: today's children as we love classic children's literature:
"Publishing is being developed, and much attention is given to the authors, who are the link between generations".
And if we talk about small children, it is important to have some kind of hero, who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to part with their heroes.
The library is constantly releasing booklets for parents, which tells what is happening in contemporary children's literature, what books should pay attention and why.
Booklets so fascinating and intriguing as the adults interested, but the library is still not for them.
Take books outside the reading room for adults is prohibited.
This magical privilege to have children.
...In the farthest room of the library there is a square roof with the ancient wooden stairs to the basement, in the library.
Stairs will be creaking under your steps - this is a very old time machine.
With a book of his childhood meet like an old friend: hi, well, we're not changing.
Ellie still walked cheerfully along the road paved with yellow bricks, Roofing bummer Ryzhikov steals a magic match, and malchish-Kibalchish and said damn the military secret Military secret is such a strong word.
Such a book is like a password, in any place can learn their.
Have in store and these rare books - for example, pre-revolutionary collection of folk tales from the aisle and erami.
Or the story of Korolenko in the famous Annex to the magazine "Niva".
Or filing "Murzilki" for 1936.
Time had aged the pages raskrasil them in tea color.
These publications readers already are.
This is the pieces for our future collections, I imagine, will retire and will do rare children's books.
But the children on it is, so to speak, will not lead: paint in older books is not very bright, and themes... open the first page and there - Lenin, party, Komsomol.
Now think: why are we all subscribed to this "Pioneer truth?"
But it was still interesting, - tells "the Russian planet" Galina Ilyasova, head of the library.
Page "Murzilki" darkened.
Galina manages the library all my life.
She knows what color cap Pinocchio, in any school year, Harry Potter became the team captain of Gryffindor on the Quidditch championship, the situations in which Carlson uses a silencer for the motor, and what does the father of Alisa Selezneva.
For librarians paid little, and all, who can live without these book series very quickly find yourself another profession.
There are only the most convinced: educators, teachers, Ministers of religion book.
You can learn more and the smile - it is believed that this feature of a professional children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation is professional.
I do love children's books: as a librarian I love that they are so smooth and beautiful were on the shelves, and I love to read them, - says Galina.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.
Reading of modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, it seems to me, in my childhood everything was different.
Books were the most interesting and exciting of all, what happened to me.
And since I loved them, it seemed to me that the library is a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone is sitting and reading.
I hope that the books will always, in spite of readers.
And rejoice when our former readers bring their children, and even grandchildren...
The rumor mill: Celtic F. C. there are no differences
Griffiths has denied talk of differences in "Celtic" after the recognition of the Dales, "hoopes" in a bad position, but he will fix it.
"Hearts" will protest against the claims of the Scottish football Association to Neilson, and Warburton is wary of signing contracts in January that could disrupt the unity of the team
"Dons" has increased the advantage over Celtic to five points
Penalty Adam Rooney in the first half gave the "Aberdeen" small advantage "Hamilton" in Pittodrie that allowed the "dons" to break away from Celtic five points.
Griffiths has denied talks about the differences
This caused the rumors about disagreements in the "Celtic" that have been foiled by Griffith, who said that he and his teammates do not suffer from any criticism intensified, in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the tension, I believe that players aspire to.
The Dutch are bored because there are no Scots in the battle for the title - de Boer
Former midfielder from Rangers and a former member of the national team of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans lost interest in "Celtic" because it does not compete for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently the representative of "Ajax", said: "In Holland, they no longer display the most compelling moments of games, "Celtic", and why?"
This is because there is no "Rangers".
People here talk not only about the return of "Rangers".
They talk about "Old firm".
They talk about both teams together, and this is something that interests them.
In games the "Old firm" is a lot of stress, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.

However, Dale stated, ""Salida" had bad periods before, and we will come again."
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand that this is very annoying, and a lot of people very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And we too, but we need to continue.
And we really, really need support Celtic because the players have become much better.
To stay together is so important.
Warburton with disbelief waiting for the January transfers
Despite opinions that appeared a couple of weeks ago, suggesting that he defined some of the objectives of the January transfer window, boss "Ranger" mark Warburton wary of the January campaign, claiming that he doesn't want to destroy the unity of the team.
Former striker of "Brentford" said: "the January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season for adaptation that you have seen in our own group this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm is adding unneeded players to those that you really need.
Michu, who is interested in Celtic, has hinted about retirement
Forward "Swansea" Michu, linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted that he could leave football after the end of its contract with the "Swans".

Donnelly: the Council Tannadice confident in management "Dundee United"
Simon Donnelly argues that the Board of Directors "Dundee United" remains confident that the team will change the situation for the better, however, agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the field has to end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare children to leave again," said Donnelly.
MacInnes glad that "ugly" won "Hamilton"
Derek MacInnes admitted that his team "Aberdeen" I had to desperately fight against the "Hamilton assis" to achieve a seventh win in a row in the championship League, which has put them five points above Celtic, at the top of the standings, thanks to a penalty Adam Rooney in the first half.
MC Inness said: "there is No such team that won anything - a Cup, or the League championship who have not won a lot of matches like that."

Why I am a witness executions in Oklahoma
Today, evading legal intervention at a late stage, I will look how to execute the person.
If this happens, and I hope that all of you don't, I'll sit in the observation gallery of death row prison in Oklahoma, when Richard Glossip to be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time this request was made back in January, through his close friend, and although I was humbled, I agreed.
With the approach of this day I began to be afraid.
So why do it?
I agreed because thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and, as there are often more than places, the results are grim lottery to decide who will be selected.
In Oklahoma the number of seats for the press was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected, he will look at it without emotion.
I can't do it.
I'll sit with my closest friends Richard Glossip, and we are experiencing their own relationship after several months of phone calls and one visit, which lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk with him.
The prison administration contends that I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I wouldn't be allowed to take a Notepad and pen to record what I see.
I will have to try to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me of Twitter in that I compromise its impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of a prisoner as he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She acknowledged that she "could better be worded", but still believes that I'm wrong in what you are doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with something that I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he was talking about.
I told him he can check me off your witness list at any time.
But he wants the journalist international media was there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that the publicity will help the movement for the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from "Huffington post" will join me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the podcasts that I have recorded.
I won't go into details here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of aiding and abetting the crime.
But I believe there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death sentence was not enough.
I believe that his execution is erroneous.
And from that perspective I'm going to watch him die.
I can't say that I will be completely unbiased.
There will be other reporters, to which it is possible for this to apply.
From me you will learn what it's like to watch people that I love die unnecessarily.
Pursued by the police persuaded the man to climb out of the canning river
The constable of the town of canning Vale managed to persuade the man to climb out of the canning river, but most stay dry.
The Perth resident wanted to escape from the police, but failed, stuck in dirty water in the shallows a few metres away from a police officer, trying to "gently persuade him to go to the beach".
Police canning-Vale was called Friday on the fact of illegal penetration of foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them, rushing in canning.
But he is not far away.
"He stood in the water and said, "I will not leave, come get me," said senior Sergeant Sandell of Kaldin.
Constable Lachlan Perevezu do not really want to wet form, so he used a safer trick - negotiation "good COP".
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," says senior Sergeant Caldin.
A player is a champion Ben cousins this memorable.
In 2006, the cousins drove into a ditch to avoid a police patrol to check on alcohol, and tried to swim across the Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but inspired local residents to invent a comic "biathlon Ben Cousins".
Peter Moody blames the stewards in an attempt espionage and threatens to leave the equestrian sports
Peter Moody has accused the stewards of Racing Victoria in an attempt to introduce a spy into his stable last year and threatened that he would immediately leave horse riding.
His target was the stewards and the staff of the division of ethics of Racing Victoria, which he blamed in that they organized a campaign against him personally, and withdrawal from the start Lady * * * because of a violation of the rules of use of drugs on launch day, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always does his best, participating in races, and he was in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of the sample Lidari at cobalt, which he can't explain.
He held his tongue about the suspicion of espionage for over a year and a half and didn't want it "looked like a green grape".
"I didn't intend to talk about it, and endured for a long time, but sometimes you it's so unsettling that you're not constrained," said Moody.
They know that it lasted.
Sometimes react, and then you have to suffer the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
Today I'm going home and sleeping.
I want to walk with your head held high and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything possible for them.
When they begin to think that it isn't, then I need to stop being a coach.
Then I have to think what to do with his license.
Earlier sensationally Moody said during an interview on racing.com that the office of ethics tried to spy him in the stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dale brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man whom I will name if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to convey the information about what I do in the stable," said Moody on Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a scammer.
If so, it should certainly apply, as I attempt to catch them failed.
Robert Ralston, a former Chairman of RVL, David Moody, the current Chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sandry, naneshney Executive Director RVL knew about it all the time and know now.
Should it not make me think that the case becomes personal?
Shouldn't in RVL to have the courage to hold accountable for what happens in this business, other people besides the trainers?
Bad I for this profession?
So if I'm bad for this profession?
Maybe the people there think it is.
Maybe they should take my license and throw me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying, maybe make them think about it.
But I came now to the point where I don't care, and that saddens me.
It makes me really sad.
I'm going to put pressure on them and lay on them the responsibility for making the decision.
I have the support from family, and I can leave.
A shame the coach only grew in the course of a long investigation into cobalt and Lidari, and the latter withdrawal of the horse from the start forced him to declare that he can "throw my licence on the table".
Moody, best known for having produced the undefeated champion black caviar, has called the requirements for the application of medication on race day "ridiculous" after the horse's legs was applied a poultice of the clay that is against the rules.
This violation of the rules at the races.
"I have to take full responsibility for it, he said.
One of my employees mistakenly gave her a compress on the leg.
She could get a compress last night.
She could get it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him in the day of the race.
Moody can be disqualified for three months in accordance with the rules on the use of medicines in day of competition for the use of the compress, over which the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people creating these rules, I know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.
The driver who hit and fled the scene in Cobram, arrested
Police have arrested a man who at the weekend I brought down the motorcyclist in Cobram and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to hospital in the Royal Melbourne with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver drove away without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.

The motorcyclist, 40-year-old resident Cobram, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Coach "Melbourne storm" Craig Bellamy cleared of charges rivals to use hard power techniques
Coach "Melbourne storm" Craig Bellamy has called criticism intercepting the ball his team as "the imposition of the agenda" on the part of the two favourites of the championship NRL.
Coach "Sydney Roosters" Trent Robinson said that judges allowed "storm" to "fight" with his team during the sudden victory "storm" in the final qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Coach "Brisbane Broncos" Wayne Bennett made the obvious allusion to the "storm" after his team won the final of the qualifying tournament of "the Northern Queensland Cowboys" on Saturday evening, when he called this game a "typical" for Rugby League and stated that two of the Queensland teams have not been "too successful" in the melee.
Bellamy defended intercept the ball for his team and said they just focused on "contact", intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that it instilled confidence criticism of his team by two of the leading trainers because it means that they are concerned about a possible defeat from "storm".
"It keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson has talked about the hard methods when they beat us with 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can vouch that we didn't change a whole year in their systems or techniques of protection, just in the last six weeks we have paid special attention to the contacts when catching the ball, and it was a turning point for us.
Trent there for three years and obviously he's coached a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and for him, it was with some shock.
Funny how it is always evident this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett about the idea of "spectacular football", reminding his teacher that "the St. George-Illawarra Dragons" Bennett won the championship in 2010, showing the "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game Saturday night with our Friday night, and look how impressive was their game," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010. "St. George's" much criticized, calling a boring team, but Wayne said that he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers impressive football, especially his young linebackers with their speed.
This is football, who would you want to play when you have such players.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone played football in his style - not every team has two such halfback, Anthony Milford and Ben hunt, so they could play.
This gives me more confidence, because they say these things, since several of them even bother playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when you made it to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game "storm" and "Roosters" was a contest with more points than a game "Broncos" and "Cowboys".
The game "Broncos" was probably good, I haven't seen her, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18, had two more attempts - and that, this is impressive football?
Or to consider impressive breaks and failed attempts?
For me it's routine.
If they have to mention, this means that at some stage we can meet there.
The "storm" at the end of this week off, since they won the right to host either the "North Queensland Cowboys" or "Cronulla sharks" next Saturday night in the preliminary final at AAMI Park stadium, tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Accused of drug possession Serb released on bail of 200 thousand dollars
The man, who faces life imprisonment for attempting to assign 40 kg of cocaine, delivered in Queensland by smuggling, was released on bail of $ 200,000.
Marco Maksimovich, 29 years old, is one of five men arrested last month after Federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on a yacht Solay, came from South America via Vanuatu and moored in the Coomer in August.
Throughout the morning Maksimovic and his associates saw at the Wharf, and later he met them at Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kg of the drug in the car Toyota Echo.
Despite the fact that Primakov is facing a life sentence for the attempted misappropriation of narcotic substances in sufficient quantity for sale, the lawyer Maksimovic argues that evidence that the latter was trying to get the whole lot, are missing, and that a man could be in a cafe without any intent.
Supreme court justice Peter Flanagan doubted that life was worth to release on bail.
The latter has ties with Serbia.
He frequently travels to Serbia", he said in court on Wednesday.
In criminal proceedings he lied to the police about their location.
The mother and stepfather of M. it was proposed to make a joint bail of $ 200,000 for his release.
"From the testimony of both becomes obvious that the amount of bail $ 200,000 is too great a financial burden," said judge Flanagan.
But this measure is not enough as an assurance that he will not disappear, said the judge.
Maksimovich allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he will betray both his Australian and Serbian passport, to report to the police daily and observe a curfew from 6 PM to 6 am.
Fotis Katsikaris: "Proud of Greece, which fought to the last seconds."

Yes, I will need some time to rebuild to post, still in the NBA I played more forward.
Now more need to withstand a large centerpiece of a contender, but I already did this before, so I think, and now cope.
CSKA last won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then they are six times reached "the Final four", but each time could not show our best basketball.
There is a perception that someone jinxed.
In this whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's complicated, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now and if we are going to show the best we can, so we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
Always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites had already defeated in the tournament, and I think this year will be the year CSKA.
As for the evil eye, I am not a superstitious person and don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, all things are possible.
I and before the games there are no specific rituals, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.

With Rome, I relate exceptionally warm memories.
For me this will be a special game, but this is not so important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with a win.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the team in the next match.
Expect Roma game, which she showed in Serie a against Juventus.

The captain of "Arsenal" Mikel Arteta said that his teammates should support the injured Jack Wilshere before the game with "Dinamo Zagreb"
In conversation with the Wilshere Wenger also stressed that it is only September, and that if the recovery Wilshere will go according to plan, nothing will prevent him to return to the game for Christmas.
Under the most favorable developments sure Wilshere will miss at least four games in England and, considering his condition, his participation in the European Championships next summer remains in question.
The worst of it in this recent issue that Wilshere confidently finished the previous season with only an ankle injury and was going back to my usual aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury threatens his career".
It's just not fully healed bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
It is not related to the ankles or injuries that had happened before.
This may be related stuff from a medical point of view, but also made Wenger, there is associated risk further injury to any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an adverse trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire recorded 23 injuries that happened to him in six years since his debut.
In addition, he played in only 65 of 157 games of Arsenal in the League over the last five seasons.
If you look at the situation Arsenal are wider, you will notice that in six of eight seasons, starting with 2007-08, Arsenal were one of two Premier League clubs, who have most missed due to injury days.
Wenger admits the probability of getting stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe the improving statistics on injuries in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, back in action after injury, you during some time are vulnerable during this time you need to recuperate and gain competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough and can handle it.
I hope that he will recover physically, I'm sure of it, and that his career is such that he deserves.
Arsenal is launching a campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday with the match against "Dinamo-Zagreb" and will continue on Saturday with games against Chelsea and next Wednesday - with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger is determined to hold the rotation.
Héctor Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so most likely in the starting lineup will play Mathieu debuchy and Arteta.
Perhaps Wenger will also enter into the composition of Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Moreale Nacho and Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain a balance and to give some respite to players who need it," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites in group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is one of the most depressing in Europe.
Dinamo are unbeaten in 41 matches since they managed to hold last season as "Invincible".
On Tuesday evening, the stadium has been affected by an earthquake measuring 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have learned a lesson last season, when the team suffered defeat in the Champions League game against Monaco, and still with a faint hope to lead the club to victory in the final of the Champions Cup.
"It's an incredible drive," said Wenger.
Furthermore, Arsenal have never done.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have ambitions but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: Comedy show, which taught us great lessons of friendship
The lack of such stories is striking, especially considering how desperate was the need of men into her confidence, now more than ever, despite the fact that the suicide rate among young men is at its maximum for 15 years.
In 2013, it has become the single biggest cause of death of men aged between 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom, and it happens with men three times more often than women.
In an attempt to sort out the problem "Campaign against miserable life" declared 2015 the year of men in order to challenge a culture that prevents men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is located in the centre of this battle, to take up the challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 University students exhibiting symptoms of depression, found that if the patient has a sufficiently large number of friends in "normal mood", the chances of recovery are doubled.
Likewise for those who are not depressed, the mentally healthy circle of friends in half reduces the chance of occurrence of mental disorders.
But, of course, that friendship worked, first of all it is necessary that she was.
In an era where communications are directed by social networks, when the preferred style to the content, the speed of response is often appreciated more than a meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to appear strong, fun loving and successful, even if in reality, reigns alone.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values of money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of inner values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship that has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, as recently noticed one billionaire, the Creator of the video game, the money actually doesn't buy more happiness.
The advantage of Friends that they are attracted to this attention.
Each character was defined not through his work but through the personality, which manifested itself in communication with friends.
The humor is constant and Joey hugs Chandler, moments watch football on the comfy chairs, lamentations Ross on Rachel - all of that comes from understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from a full exploration of their feelings.
As I said the employee "Samaritans": "...my role is a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal mood, stresses how even a small fellowship of friends can benefit".
Often those men who come to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old precept "live with it" much the same as the feeling that a Frank conversation about the issues can be perceived as a weakness".
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer a longer working mechanisms to overcome.
It highlighted the subtle moments of friendship.
As for my tasks, the status of an outsider, talking on the phone, helps people in desperate times, long-term support comes from the middle circle of family and friends.
So, if you visit in FriendsFest Comedy Central this weekend, where the fully restored holiday decorations, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk.
Or, better yet - if at Starbucks, you will see a lonely person, smile and say "hi".
Not to guess in advance, what benefits can bring friendship.
TV series Friends show on Comedy Central from beginning to end, all 236 episodes, tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal, helping PSG to defeat Malmo
Angel di Maria along with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani celebrates scored goals against Malmo.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored than allowed Paris easy to get around malmö on Tuesday.
Here is the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did the trick when "Paris St Germain" started its game in the Champions League with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmo at the stadium Parc des princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after he began his first game in the Champions League as a player "PSG", to set the direction of the Champions of France, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with "real Madrid" and Shakhtar Donetsk in group a, "Paris" had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish Champions as they set their sights not on the qualification of the playoffs, and the continuation of a series of successful games the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They have earned points, but at the same time, it was not the best decision from Laurent Blanc to calculate Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the field in the game against the team from his hometown and the club where he started his illustrious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win with a score 2:0, to give opponents problems and to play perfectly on defense - that's a good start, even if there are still things that we will need to be finalized in the course of the season," said Blanc.
This is promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I regret that we didn't score one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic back after injury at one of the substitutions in the Paris team, which earned her a draw with the score 2:2 in the match against "Bordeaux" in the First League at the weekend, but it was pushed to the back Di Maria in the fourth minute.
Argentine striker said as a player, able to lead PSG to a new level in Europe, after it last month bought "Manchester United", and he proved why when he ran onto a pass from Marco verratti behind the protection of malmö and beautifully finished the attack by sending the ball past Johan Willand in the far corner.
However, if someone was expecting then from Paris easy and big win, they had to be disappointed.
Malmo, which defeated Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, comprised of nine world-class players on the field early in the game, five defenders and two Midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of Nikola Djurdjica kick in which the ball flew past the far goal post from Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
But Paris was at times let down himself ineffective programs and weak attacks, particularly from Ibrahimovic, who in the first half and was unable to finish at least five attempts, and then could not handle the ball, Cavani scored immediately after the resumption of play.
Nevertheless, he showed himself much more skilful in the exact passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, which received Di Maria sent the ball curled in a shot that was held very tightly to the rod past the Wieland on 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal in the season after Ibrahimovic corrected the ball sent to center field from the left wing Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that were in malmö regarding return to play, and only intercept the ball Wieland at close range did not allow David Luiz to increase the final score before substitute Esekiel LAVEZZI disallowed the goal at the end of the game.
The coach of malmö Agay charade later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, he said: "Our last game in the Champions League was held in December last year."
Since then, we only played in the Swedish League, and it's not the level.
Qualification is not enough.
The Glory Of "Paris"!
It was a wonderful match with them.

Maintain Economy ― Nobel laureate: globalization
Print the globalization Processes should help reduce inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, the difference in incomes in the emerging economies, on the contrary, grows.
Eric Maskin.
To fix this, you need to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, says chief researcher of the International laboratory of choice and analysis of decisions of the HSE, Nobel prize winner in Economics in 2007 Eric Maskin.
In the last twenty years the world has experienced an unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trading borders between the countries became more open.
Proponents of globalization have predicted large benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions largely came true," says the Maskin.
For example, China and India have received significant growth in GDP per capita.
However, not all so rosy.
It was expected that globalization would reduce the gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" in poorer countries, which manifests itself in the large income inequality, or rather - pay.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, said Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies", published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by ENI HSE.
Together with economist, Professor at Harvard University Michael Kremer Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that shows why increasing the difference in income in poor countries with the growth of globalization, reminds ENI HSE.
In the new global market specific processes occur.
To demonstrate, Maskin distinguishes four levels of professional development - A and B for rich countries, C and D for the poor.
After the globalization D professionals from poor countries do not have enough qualifications to cooperate with experts A and B from rich countries.
And if the staff level of the poor countries wages are growing thanks to cooperation with employees of B from the rich, then workers D growth either do not feel their pay is falling.
The final effect is that the internationalization of production will increase the gap in wages between the two categories of specialists in poor countries and consequently increased levels of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin proposed an amazingly beautiful model, alternative the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It allows you to explain why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, tenured Professor, head of the International laboratory of analysis and selection decisions, the head of the Department of mathematics of the HSE.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin is to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as noted by scientist, have no money and companies not willing to pay for their education.
In such situation, a significant role may be played by governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations, says Maskin.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in any case does not call for a stop of process of globalization, which brought and brings fruit in the form of GDP growth of countries.

The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret in connection with the closing force at the Library of foreign literature of the American center.
The centre worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American center of the U.S. Embassy in the Russian state library. M. I. Rudomino in Moscow.

Tefft reminded that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the educational exchange program FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
Green Tribunal was quick to judge.
A typical situation: four officials stand in front of the Desk judge Swatanter Kumar, listening to his claims for the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We have provided you with a 110-page order that you laughed over it, says Kumar. -
If you will put one more brick, we'll have to demolish all the existing buildings.
Kumar heads the national Green Tribunal (NGT) is a judicial body established in 2010 in order to stop the rapid pollution accompanying rapid economic growth in recent decades.
During this time the Tribunal had to consider more than 10 thousand lawsuits related to pollution, waste collection, geological developments, toxic waste and the construction of dams.
In two of three cases the court shall decide on termination of building, leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: less than 60 years since the Declaration of independence reinforced the industrial development of India transformed from a country of pristine jungle in one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries of the world.
The problem is especially acute in large Metropolitan areas, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with the rapid urbanisation: cities covered with dense smog, rivers full of pesticides and waste of businesses and households, and the few remaining residential areas are being cut down for building new residential neighborhoods.
Despite the formal support of the green movement from the state, NRT is regularly criticized by governments of Narendra modi, as often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of the largest investment projects.
So, in may this year environment Minister, called the court decision "extreme" and "impossible".
Sometimes a court decision is really impossible to execute put by the court at the time, confirms a lawyer for environmental matters Raj Panjwani.
However, impossible deadlines and have a positive side: at least they force the responsible persons to move.
"Its main purpose was to shake up the system," adds the lawyer.
The green Tribunal has repeatedly canceled major project: in his account of the cessation of construction of airport, power plants and hundreds of smaller structures.
This is about people trying also not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of pharmaceutical companies in the state Telagana, zagrebneva local river fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs", - commented on his decision Kumar.
However, such explanations do not always find understanding among the ordinary people whose lives can change with one stroke of a judicial pen.
So, in April, the Tribunal has decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years of the entry into the capital, triggering a nationwide outrage.
Despite dramatically fallen in popularity and a barrage of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to cancel the decision.
Instead, it ordered the Delhi government statistics on inbound and outbound means of transport, but also made a proposal to buy 10 thousand additional buses after learning in the factories, whether they are to obey such an order.
As the court began to get such pollution sources as landfills, fuel quality, and even traffic incidents, people's anger had begun to subside.
But the most painful subject principal judge was the program for cleaning of the river Ganges, announced with fanfare by Prime Minister Narendra modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges is sacred to Hindus the river, the judge will often not restrain his emotions and moves on to a Creek.
You know, what does the word "Holy"?
Someone poured water from the Ganges on the statue, and it turned out to be feces, is excited judge. -
You continue to pollute the river, they think the Ganges is a Ganges, it will take away all our sins.
This river, which we worship, and see what you do with her every day.
Cleaning the Ganges is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project, announced by the new government.
Currently the number of fecal bacteria in the river exceeds the norm more than 120 times.
Each year 1.5 to 3 million out of 700 swimmers in it Indians die from infectious diseases.
In February, the Narendra modi even donated to the Fund for saving the Ganga money raised from the sale of his suit, in which he met with Barack Obama and 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the Prime Minister of populism: the costume was bought for 700 thousand dollars, while the cleaning of the river requires at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India still have a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, however, believe that the price of progress must be ecology.
"In a developing country conversations about the environment often perceived as a luxury, - said the activist of the organization "call of the Ganga" Malik Bhanot. -
And the court tries to find a middle ground between ecology and development".
