The social map of the inhabitant of the Ivanovo province acknowledges as the electronic means of payment.
Changes provide for the retention of privilege to the passage in the public passenger transport.
The order of the organization of the privilege passage of citizens with the use of a social map of the inhabitant of the Ivanovo province since September 24 changes.
As reports the press service the government of Russia on the Ivanovo province, changes provide for the retention of privilege to the passage in the public passenger transport and give the diagram of contra accounts on the social map in the correspondence with the requirements of the federal law of № 161 FZ “about the national pay system”.
In this case the social map of the inhabitant of the Ivanovo province acknowledges as the electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application change.
So, the limit of completion is established now not in the trips, as it is earlier, and in the size of cash resources, with the retention of winter and summer periods - in winter not more than 400 rubles, in the summer period - not more than 800 rubles during the present month.
Now to the possessors of social map on the output in the transport receipts will have to track not a quantity of remained trips, but the remainder of cash resources.
The cost of privilege passage for the citizens will compose 1/2 tariffs, which acts in ferryman.
Provincial budget compensates remained half of fare.
The graph of the completion of social map by cash resources remains before - in the period from 24 days of previous month of 23 days of present month.
The new order of passage on the social map will have a number of advantages.
Thus, appears the opportunity to keep detailed account of the expense of cash resources on the social map with an accuracy to kopecks.
Furthermore, appears the opportunity of the recovery of the enrolled, but unconsumed cash resources.
Let us add also that the diagram of contra accounts with the ferrymen becomes transparent, since now half of fare pays citizen, and budget compensates accurately the same sum to ferryman.
Of no commission with the introduction on the map of cash resources be collected there will be.
In turn, Vasiliy Silkin, deputy department head of road economy and transport of the Ivanovo province, reported that in the region were in 2014 perfected more than 33 million trips with the use of a social map, 2015-m - almost 25 million trips.
In the provincial budget to the assignment of the privilege passage of citizens with the use of a social map are provided more than 470 million rubles.
Due to the state on September 1 the sum of compensation to these purposes comprised more than 312 million rubles.
During the bell into 911 instructors it acknowledges in the murder of the friend
During the bell into 911 voices almost without the trembling the instructor of VUZ (Institute of Higher Education) of Shennon Lamb described to the police that he shot down its friend and that were necessary the colleagues, who would arrive in them home.
Lamb emphasized that in the house there is “the doggie”, which was living, but, probably, it was detuned, and he said that the contacts of the family members of that been killed can be found in its telephone.
Inside the house the policemen revealed body Amy Prentiss and note, negligently written by hand on the white leaf of the ruled paper: “To me it is very it's a pity, I would want to return everything, I loved Amy, and it - only woman, who sometimes loved me”, it is said in the note according to the representatives of organs, signed by Lambom.
Nothing she indicated that Lamb, which conducted two online-courses at the university of the state of delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had time by that time to take a trip for 300 miles into the university campus, where, as the police considers, it shot down by all the respected instructor of the history of Yitang Schmidt on the threshold of his office.
The Police Chief of the university of the state of delta Lynn Baford reported that the colleagues of university learned about the shooting in 10:18 the mornings.
It reported that Lamb made that truthful bell in 911 soon after this.
It will prove to be to one more toward the end of the day of victims: Lamb put an end to itself, as soon as police it surrounded it.
Next day after shooting in the educational institution forced students and instructors to hide behind the closed doors, the colleagues of organs still attempted to accumulate into one picture the motives, which prompted Lamba.
The information, with which shared the inspectors in both ends of the state, and also students and colleagues, who knew it, they helped to compose the portrait of the talented, but, possibly, perturbed teacher.
Students described that they with the impatience waited its lessons.
The police in Gautier, where died Prentiss, reported that after they it is not charges in the violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in book the written to them, in which he expressed gratitude “excellent people”, with which he intersected in his teaching life.
Both of them taught in the department of social sciences and history, which counts 17 instructors, and many students attended the lectures of that, etc.
There were at the same time some prerequisites of the appearance of problems.

In this year it taught only in two online-courses.
Recent changes in the university rules of method to the work meant that the degree of doctor, above obtaining by which so persistently worked Lamb, would not be guaranteed to it automatic obtaining of the post of instructor.
The President of university William Laforzh reported that to him nothing it is known about the conflict between Lambom and Schmidt, but “obviously, Mister Lamba had something on the mind”.
These are the questions, which Lamb no longer will be able to answer.
The police attacked the track of Lamba after its flight from the campus, when it was sent back in Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before it they could arresting, Lamb was shot down from the otdnozaryadnogo pistol of 38 calibers on the rear court of house, in one mile to the south from the house of its parents in the suburb of Grinvill, Mississipi, it reported the coroner of region Washington brooms Johnson.
Its machine power-on still stood on the access route.
To Nesrazu it was incomprehensible, why Lamb arrived into this house, although according to Johnson, it assumes that he knew people the lived in it.
Lamb grew in those edges.

It obtained the degree of the doctor of the pedagogical sciences of in spring the same year.
One of the old friends of Lamba described it as clever, charismatic and merry person.
Carla Kheyrstons it described that by it there were 15, and to Lambu of 20 years, when they were introduced through the general friends.
It and its friends learned in the upper classes, and it was the class fellow somewhat older, who for several years attempted to learn to play it on the guitar.
In those years it enjoyed success in women.
All girls melted, when it was a number”, says Kheyrston, by which now 40 and which lives in Jackson, the suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss up to the moment of events were, apparently, encountered already some time.
He said during the bell into 911 Lamb: “I killed my wife”, but record about the registration of their marriage is absent.
The pair had the dog by the name of the Lightning, which lived with them in Gautier in the brick house, whose reverse side leaves to the channel.
According to the police, with the dog everything in the order.
Former husband of Prentiss, Sean o ' Stin, reported that they bred 15 years ago, but they remained friends, and that they have the daughter, by whom now 19 years.
“It is entirely depressed”, it described about ' Stin about the daughter.
It and its mother were good friends.

Then they together played from time to time on the concerts.
About ' Stin described that its daughter writes music and he sings.
Prentis was nurse and it worked online on the different companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and on the pluralism the coordinator of entertaining programs in the dimly illuminated bar of The Julep Room in Gautier's suburb, said that the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss in the evening on September 5, when Lamb finished to play on the guitar and labial bellows for the infrequent visitors.
Nothing suspicious it was observed.
“Simply happy pair”, he said.
We cheered themselves and bantered above each other.
In the sense, that they both were very ingenious.

8 results of interrogation, which show that Donald Tramp does not joke
Some attempted to hang the label up of provocateur to it.
Others it, after perceiving as joke.
But some require scandal.
But however try some Republicans to oscillate dignity of Donald Tramp in the results of interrogations, this for them did not succeed (thus far).
Ten of the last 11 national interrogations demonstrated Donald Tramp's advantage in the two-digit numbers, and some begin seriously to ask, that this means for the magnate of real estate from the point of view of chances to obtain nomination.
Is certain, the only beginning of selective cycle.
Nothing from this it means that Tramp has a chance to nominirovatsya the Republican Party.
Experts he indicates that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry was inferior its preimshchesvo to collecting popularity Herman Kane, no one of which conquered one state in the process of nominirovaniya.
And there is many reasons, on which it would begin to be beaten at general election.
But the external groups, such as “the super-committee of political aktinosti” of Bush's Dzheba, and economic conservative group “the club of increase” recognize the undiminishing force of Tramp and begin to obtain their dollars in order to overturn him.
Here are some numbers of the interrogations, which speak, that the magnate of real estate - not simply intermediate phase:
The ratings of sympathy for Tramp were developed by 180 degrees.
Directly before Donald Tramp it announced its kandidatstvo in the middle of June, interrogation at the university of Monmouth showed that only two of 10 Republicans enthusiastically support this magnate in the sphere of real estate.
To the middle of July this was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August this was 52 percent.
Now six of 10 Republicans enthusiastically support Donald Tramp.
Approximately three of 10 indicate that they have negative opinion.
And all these indices gain on top of initial stages.
The interrogation of Quinnipiac in Iowa last week revealed, that 60 percent of Republicans there polozhtelno relate to Tramp.
Two thirds of those voted for GOP it would arrange by Tramp as the candidate.
In the interrogation CNN/ORC, carried out last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they either related “with the enthusiasm” or with “the satisfaction”, if Tramp became candidate.
Only two of 10 indicate that they would be “detuned”, if it became candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates much the same the level of enthusiasm as Tramp (43 percent indicate that they would relate “with the enthusiasm” against 40 percent of those, who speak the same about Tramp).
Following on the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, whom has only 21 percent.
They indicate from the other side, 47 percent of Republicans that they will be “they are not satisfied” or “detuned”, if the favorite of the establishment of Dzheb Bush will become candidate.
The majorities of Republicans do not consider Tramp's temperament problem.
While they mass criticize Tramp for his boasting and insults, 52 percent inclined voters in the entire country of the inclined to the Republicans think that the magnate has the suitable temperament in order to be the President, as showed the interrogation of ABC News/of Washington post, carried out on Monday.
The same number figures at the country's first closed meeting in the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that in he is that person himself, who can be main commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he not that person, who can be effective at the post, and almost six of 10 independent voters indicate that its temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to the communications of ABC/Post.
Voter-Republicans get accustomed to this thought.
When they put on their hats of experts, voter-Republicans think that Tramp - this seriously.
To a question, who the most likely winner in the nomination of GOP, four of 10 said that Tramp was favorite, according to interrogation CNN/ORC last week.
This no longer so, when four of 10 were placed on Bush's Dzheba at the end of July.
Complete disclosure: The voters of GOP earlier did not have correct magic kristala.
At this time in the past cycle cycle four of 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, whereas only 28 percent supported the possible candidate of Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, this shows that many voters of GOP considers Tramp's campaign convincing.
Even if Republicans would be joined around another candidate, Tramp as before in front of all rest.
Some experts indicate that this spread, most likely, plays to Tramp's advantage, and simultaneously not that do not support Tramp are evenly distributed among supporting more than other ten candidates.
But the interrogation, carried out by the university of Monmouth in the beginning of September shows that in the hypothetical competition “face to face” between Tramp and majority of other candidate-Republicans, Tramp almost always obtains the support of majority.
It anticipates Karli to Fiorinu to 13 points, Marco Rubio to 14 points, Walker to 15 points, Dzheba of Bush to 19 points and finally Renda of gender, John Kesich and Chris Christie to 33 points.
In it no one's with Ted Kruz.
The unopposed candidate, who it does go around?
Ben Carson passed businessman to entire 19 points in the hypothetical competition “face to face”.
Only more than half of the supporters of Donald Tramp they indicate that they thought over.
New interrogation CBS/NYT, carried out on Tuesday, shows that it is only more than half of those voting, that support Tramp, they indicate that they are assured in their voices.
Obviously, much can occur and change situation, and no one can in reality say that it never will think over.
46 percent indicate that they leave the door of that opened for other candidates.
Those n is less, the most stressed competition in Tramp at the given moment - with the colleague-outsider by neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters, who indicate that they thought over, they will most likely, select Tramp.
Six of 10 Republicans indicate that they are agreeable with Tramp apropos of the immigration.
Since Donald Tramp two months ago named the immigrants from Mexico “opressors” in its appearance, which opens campaign, the theme of immigration became most urgent in the conversations in 2016.
It disturbs some, that Tramp's pozerstvo will avert the key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican Party and will prevent rebranding.
But in accordance with the interrogation of ABC/Post, carried out on Monday, six of 10 Republicans indicate that they are agreeable with Tramp in questions of immigration.
Therefore until immigration attracts universal attention it is, it seems, that Donald Tramp will remain on the same position.
Disappointment with government collects new revolutions.
Donald Tramp and Ben Carson now rely on support approximately from half of voter-Republicans, mainly, because of their status of outsiders.
Six of 10 Republicans on Monday the new interrogation of ABC/Post declare, that they rather want political outsider, than man with the work experience in the government.
And they are also offended in Washington.
The interrogation of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, carried out two weeks ago, shows that three of four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed by the activity of Republicans in the congress, in this case 54 percent “are not satisfied”, and 21 percent “in the fury”.

Metcash starts campaign on the initiative from below for dealing with the strong pressure of Aldi
Metcash attempts to protect its stores of IGA from strong pressure of Aldi in South Australia and West Australia.
The wholesale supplier of food products on the initiative from below launched campaign on protection of the market share of the retailers of IGA in South Australia and West Australia in light of the forthcoming infusion by the company of Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi prepares to open two wholesale storages and the first of 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of the following year, supermarkets of Metcash and IGA strengthen relations with the local suppliers of food products and move the brand of IGA by means of marketing in the leading media outlets and social networks and on the measures of the type “Adelaide Show”.
To the campaign are joined retailers and the suppliers of IGA, such, as the producer of frozen Simmo ' s from Dansboro, which proposes tasting in the stores of IGA, and shop owners, the selling with the reduction to permanent clients tickets to the matches of the football league of South Australia.
It is expected that Metcash will open more than the details of its strategy of protection on September 29 - day, when this wholesale supplier of food products, alcoholic beverages and economic goods will spend his yearly day of strategies of investor.
On KON is set several, since in South Australia and West Australia the stores under the brand of IGA compose almost 30% of all stores of Metcash and shows higher profitability than the network of Metcash IGA in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known as the adherents of customary routes; therefore market is here more favorable for the retailers of IGA, than in the states new southern Wales, Victoria and queensland - more than 30 percent in YUA and 24 percent in WA in comparison with approximately 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, consider that Aldi otobet 5 percent of the market for food products in these two states in the course of 12 months after the discovery of its first stores, taking away the volume of sale in all being present players, but mainly, in the independent retailers.
In the report, published on this week, that Kirat, the analyst of Morgan Stanley, considers that the retailers of IGA can lose in sales 360 million dollars in the year, and Metcash - 250 million dollars toward the end of 2016.
Forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi in the following year will open 25 stores in SA even 30 in WA, after attaining sales on 500 million and 600 million dollars on these markets respectively.
The losses of gain and volumes of sales of food products with the high level of constant expenditures of Metcash can cost company of approximately 13 million incomes to the payment of percentages and taxes, counts Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly, because of Aldi and Coles, and this with the fact that the recent the analysis of the company of Morgan Survey explained that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Stanley they consider that sales of food products of Metcash will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and by 2.1 percent in 2018, after decreasing the portion of company on the market from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week chief fund manager Khemish Duglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, noted being present at the business dinner in Melbourne, that Metcash “can with the high probability disappear during the decade.
The company of Metcash refused to publicly comment on Mr. Duglass's commentaries.
But it is assumed that the member of the board of directors of the company of Metcash was connected with Mr. Duglass last week.
The share of IGA on the market was reduced since 2010 from 18 to 14 percent, and the incomes of Metcash from the business in the sphere of food products, which the company supplies the approximately 1200 retailers of IGA, they fell by 43 percent on the comparison since 2012 as a result of operating deleveridzha and in view of the pressure on the indices of sales and profitability.
Nevertheless, company does not surrender, spending more than 150 million dollars yearly for equalizing of retail prices with the prices in Coles and Woolworths on thousands of positions every week and helping the retailers of IGA in the reconstruction of commercial areas, and also proposing the rapidly expanding assortment of fresh products and wider selection of firm food products.
The Director-General of Metcash Ien Morris says that equalizing prices and re-equipment of commercial areas collects turnovers, and it hopes that the company will attain an increase in the clean profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakisa supports the President of Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Of Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor, but not criticism for its behavior.
Of Tanasi Kokkinakis indirectly suffered in the recent scandal around its friend of Nika Kirosa and for its behavior it deserves honor more than criticism, as the President of Tennis Australia Steve Healy speaks.
Kokkinakis, youngest in the talented duet and frequently called “Special Ks”, involuntarily proved to be in the center stage because of the shameful skirmish of Kirosa from Stenom Vavrinkoy at the tournament Montreal Masters.
Soon after this, during the hot qualification match to Cincinnati for judge at tower it was necessary to twice separate Kokkinakisa and his enemy of Ryan Kharrisona, in this case Harrison declared: “Vavrinka had to pack to the blades of Kirosa, and I must pack to the blades of this fellow”.
C of those times, as Kokkinakisa for the last time they saw breaking racket after spasm in its foot it saved Richard Gaske from the possible defeat on US Open, Healy predanno protects Kokkinakisa.
Youth at present is situated in the glasgow, competing with Sam Grotom for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomich in the single discharge in the semi-final of the goblet of Davis against Great Britain.
“I sharply survive about one thing, namely that Tanasi drew in conflict”, said Healy.
It actually broke the racket, when in it brought together foot on US Open, but he is the not first player, who broke racket when they collapsed hope, and I know Tanasi sufficiently well in order to be confident in the fact that it would not begin to be proud of this.
But in reality it managed itself very well in the sufficiently provocative situations on US, with Harrison and so forth, and I am confident, that he deserves confidence.
It surrounds outstanding command, in it excellent family, and I simply think that they entered a little dishonestly with it.
It very mature 19-year person, it much works, excellently is entered in the command, he never did not have problems with other players, they respect it out of Kort, it intensively is trained, it in the outstanding form, it the very purposeful and developed young person, and I think that him should be estimated on the merit.
Healy also supported the solution to forgive Kirosa for the important match, which is begun on Friday, assuming “mutual agreement” by correct output for all, but calculating, that the fellow from Canberra will return to the command as the long-term player.
“, first of all, we want so that the command completely would be concentrated on the match, but not on the disputes all around [Kirosa]”, said Healy.
And I think that he drooped was collected the force very rapidly, that prove people of the type of Federer and Marreya, it grows on the eyes in the public, it allowed a number of serious errors and it deserves that entire criticism, that it obtains, but we attempt to help it to realize the consequences of our actions, and it is necessary, I count, to derive him from the center stage for some time so that he could think over above them, and this is best anything for the command and it is best anything for it.
Migratory crisis in Europe: Hungary declares about the emergency, it shuts boundary, detains the migrants
After declaring about the state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday overlapped boundary with Serbia on the southern boundary and it detains those, who attempt to penetrate in the country illegally in order to hold in control flow of migrants the being flowed inward.
Disorders on the border occurred - hundreds of migrants were saved in the near-boundary territory, on that Serbian authorities sharply negatively reacted.
After getting stuck to the indeterminate period in the section of the road between the check points of two countries, people, which ran from the armed violence in themselves on the native land, broke tents and were based on this locality.
However, dissatisfaction increased.
When police helicopter turned above them, migrants shouted “open boundary!” and insults in the address of the Hungarian police of special designation screamed out.
Some into the sign of protest rejected the food and water.
The minister of foreign affairs of Serbia declared “unacceptable” the dispatching of migrants back from Hungary, when their more and more greatly he arrives from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be the part of the solution of problem, but not associated damage.
It is necessary to within the next few days conduct negotiations with Brussels and other countries”, stated in Prague Ivitsa Dachich.
Unrests on the Hungarian-Serbian boundary began next day after block of 28 countries it could not develop general immigration policy at the joint meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to bear general responsibility for 40 000 people, that search for refuge in those overfilled of Italy and Greece, and they expressed hope for the fact that in the future (in the following month or toward the end of the year) will be the agreed terms, according to which the states - the members of the European Union will accept the 120 additional 000 refugees, including of refugees from Hungary.
The chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday required to gather on the following week the special summit of the European Union for considering the immigration crisis, which enveloped continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for the fast actions from the side of Brussels or neighbors.
Declared on Tuesday state of emergency in two southern regions gave to authorities more than authorities to the actions in the relation to crisis, which allowed them to overlap roads and to accelerate the judicial matters about assylm.
Meanwhile the minister of foreign affairs of Vengii Peter Siyyarto stated that his country plans also announce fence from the barbed wire in the section of boundary with Rumania in order to overlap the flow of the migrants through the country, now, when it finished fence on the Serbian boundary.
The correspondent of CBS News Charlie Dagat reported that even prisoners were connected to the urgent work on the completion of fence from the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
For the latter several months Hungary became basic “bottleneck” and point of crossing the border of the European Union for the migrants, many of whom are refugees - the victims of wars in Syria and countries of the Near East.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister of the country Victor Orban insists on what the majority arrived people of the arrived into the country are economic migrants, who search for more satisfactory life, but not by refugees - victims of the military actions, which have right to the protection, and this point of view sharply disperses from the opinions of other countries the European Union, in Vol. h. of Germany.
The new laws, which entered Hungary by the force in midnight, consider now crime intersection or damage of the 4-meter (13-one-foot) fence from the barbed wire, built with government along the southern boundary with Serbia, and are also included more prolonged prison sentences for those accused in the trade by people.
“Because of the situation, caused by mass migration, Hungarian government declares state of emergency”, stated to journalists the representative of the government of Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city Szeged.
We clearly give to understand: the illegal crossing of border - crime.
Formally parliament still must sanction the distribution of the military forces, which is expected on the following week, but the reporters of Associated Press, who are located on the border, during several days they already observe there the presence armed soldiers of the armed to the teeth with the vehicles and dogs.
Derd to Bakondi, adviser Orbana on the national security, reported catching by the authorized organs 45 people, that were being attempted to cross boundary, on boundary itself, and 15 additional people - inside the country.
They crossed boundary, after breaking fence, they are located at the given moment under arrest of the police they are charged with the accomplishment of administrative disturbances according to the new laws.
Authorities rapidly restore fence.
Hungarian authorities Tuesday morning also shut two of seven passages on the border with Serbia, after driving home for blocking of one of the passages the railroad car, wound by barbed wire.
Disorders flared up on the main passage through the boundary near) Roske (Hungary city, since Hungarians placed official accomodation for the passage of people inside the metallic container, and the crowds of people pressed each other in order to burst open inward.
To penetrate the approximately 20 persons inward it was possible, in this case thousands of people remained outside.
One additional group of migrants blocked the main highway, which leads from Serbia to Hungary, and declared about the failure of the food and water, until them they pass to Hungary.
Elections of 2016: The advantage of Hillary Clinton above Bernard Sanders was reduced doubly in the national interrogation
The former Secretary of State of Hillary Clinton continues to retain double-digit advantage in the race of Democrats for the nomination in the entire country, but senator Bernie Sanders of it overtakes.
Clinton now has a support into 47 percent among the primary voter-Democrats (downward from 58 percent), and Sanders goes by the second with 27 percent (upward from 17 percent).
Vice President Dzho Bayden, who yet did not declare, it is assembled to participate in the presidential race, the support of 15 percent of primary voter-Democrats is obtained.
The majority of voter-Democrats say in more than five months prior to the beginning of rivalry on the primary elections that it is still too early to speak, that they were determined with that candidate, whom they will support.
Supporters Clinton are more assured in their selection, than podderzhvayushchie of other candidates.
From the time of conducting the interrogation of CBS News in the past month Clinton lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders attained some bonuses.
Clinton retains large advantage among the women and moderated, but this advantage was reduced.
Its support among the men substantially fell, and Sanders lags behind it in all to 5 points.
The preference, returned Clinton by voter-Democrats of up to 50 years, disappeared, and they with Sanders now on the equal.
However, Clinton still has large advantage among more the elder voters.
In the past month Clinton passed Sanders to the double-digit number among the liberals, but Sanders now has an advantage into 5 points in this group.
Almost half of primary voter-Democrats in the entire country they indicate that they with the enthusiasm would support Clinton, if it became candidate from this party.
Fourth would support it with some reservations, and 15 additional percent would support it only because it candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Possibly, it is not surprising that the current supporters Clinton, will most likely, appear more than enthusiasm to her calculation.
Among those, who at the present moment do not support Clinton, views are more contradictory - only about fourth with her enthusiasm would support.
Whereas 48 percent of primary voter-Democrats indicate that they with the enthusiasm supported Clinton, a smaller quantity of voter-Republicans they speak the same about their leader, Donald Tramp (35 percent).
When to supporters Clinton is assigned the open question, why they want to see by candidate its, most popular answer - that it has a necessary experience (16 percent), then - that now the time of the woman-President (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 percent).
Also supporters Clinton speak about the association, which connects it with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also is called soglasne on questions and chances to the election.
Since the Vice President considers potential participation in the elections, 57 percent of primary voter-Democrats would want so that it would be joined to the race - although third consider that it does not follow it.
When they ask them, whom they wanted to see in the second place among the party's nominees, primary voter-Democrats in the majority of the cases call Biden.
Clinton more than half says among the supporters that they would select Biden by the second, this is greater than in Sanders.
If Biden decides not to advance his candidacy from the Democratic Party, the advantage of Hillary Clinton above Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among participants in the race to 30 points without it.
Fifty five percent of voter-Democrats see in Clinton candidate with the best chances to the victory at general election; however, this number was reduced from 78 percent in the past month.
Biden with the large delay in the second place, but the percentage of those, who consider as his most likely candidate, increased according to this index.
Nevertheless, answering a question, which most important of all in the candidate, voter-Democrats select different versions besides the chances to be selected.
It is analogously to situation in the past month, no one of the candidates from the Democrats or potential candidates is unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Candidates from the Democrats, or potential candidates, they showed a good result according to some key characteristics among the primary voters from their party.
Majority considers Clinton, Sanders and Biden the honest and deserving confidence people, which possess good leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads on the honesty, and strong side Clinton in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of primary voter-Democrats do not consider Clinton honest and that deserving confidence, two times it is more than those, who speak the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have the specific opinion about it on this score.
Primary voter-Democrats as a whole also consider similar ideological views Clinton, Sanders and Biden.
On all these measures of approximately fourth of voter-Democrats do not have any opinion about Sanders.
Although questions relative to the personal box of electronic mail and server in Hillary Clinton into the sojourn by its Secretary of State continue, the majority of primary voter-Democrats are satisfied by its explanation they on this score and consider that this did not influence negatively their general opinion about it.
But this is entirely another story in the American Public as a whole.
Half of Americans it is today not satisfied by its explanation, and are satisfied only about third.
The opinions of community about this were divided still in March, soon after this history became known.
The majorities of Americans indicate that the controversy apropos of the electronic mail in no way influenced their general opinion about Clinton, although 36 percent indicate that their opinion about it deteriorated.
In essence this Republicans, it is more than six of every 10, who asserts that their opinion about Clinton deteriorated.
Even with the fact that Clinton consider honest and deserving confidences the voters from its party, this continues to be problem for it among the registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent consider it honest and that deserving confidence, to eight points it is below in comparison with the past month, and to 15 on the comparison since May.
Sixty two percent of the registered voters do not consider it honest and that deserving confidence.
The at the same time 55 registered voters in the entire country do not consider Tramp honest and that deserving confidence.
Clinton and Tramp both, however, obtain good marks on the leadership qualities.
Of six thoroughly tested candidates Biden, Carson and Bush show the best result on the honesty.
Majorities see in Sanders faster honest person, than no, but as about Carson, many they have about it no opinion.
The range of error for the sample from 351 primary voter-Democrats composes 6 percent points.
According to the results of national interrogation Ben Carson close approached Donald Tramp
Ben Carson close approached Donald Tramp in the last interrogation of CBS/New of York Times
These two candidate collected half of electorate in the new interrogation, after leaving all rest in search of the support under the feet
Voter-Republicans in the entire country continue to mass support Tramp, the percentage of support of whom increased with 23% in the recent interrogation of CBS, carried out on the eve of the debates on Fox News in the past month, to 27% in the interrogation, carried out on Tuesday.
But Carson took off within the same period from 6% to 23%.
Interrogation also showed that Carson uses support in all demographic groups, after making room Tramp in the group of voter-Republicans with higher education.
Remaining candidates, with exception of Karli Fioriny and governor Ogayo John Kasich, rolled away back together with the governor of Wisconsin Scott by Walker, whose support fell from 10% in the past month to 2% now.
The former governor of Florida Dzheb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and senator from Florida of Marco Rubio together occupy the third place with 6%.
The range of error for the sample of 376 voter-Republicans in this newest interrogation composes plus-minus 6%, interrogation was conducted in September.
Recent interrogation CNN/ORC, published last week, showed Carson's growth in the interrogations - after demonstrating support to 19% among the Republicans, after Tramp with 32% of support.
The last interrogation of ABC News/of Washington Post also showed that Tramp substantially anticipates Carson.
In connection with an increase in the support of Carson last week Tramp made several critical attacks of the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized himself for the fact that he subjected to doubt Tramp's faith.
“To us is necessary energy”, said Tramp on past Saturday during closing of campaign in Iowa.
Five members of brotherhood are charged with death of the freshman of the college of Baruch
Approximately two years later after the loss of college student during the ritual of dedication into the brotherhood in the mountains Pokono in Pennsylvania charge in the murder was advanced against five people.
“The members of the brotherhood of pi the delta of Psi from the New York college of Baruch brutally attacked on the vat “of Michael” Denga during the rite of dedication in September 2013 and did not deliver him in time into the hospital, which involved its death”, they reported in the police.
Officials indicate that student with the tied eyes and 30-pound knapsack with the sand after the back several times pushed, until it attempted to achieve goal, going over the slippery surface.
Maj. Deng finally complained, that in it aches the head and then it fell without the consciousness.
The members of the brotherhood of pi the delta of Psi did not ring in 911, when Deng lost consciousness, and they waited still supposedly the hour before to deliver it into the hospital, they speak in the police.
They, however, found time in order to replace the clothing of Denga, to find in Google its symptoms and to be connected with Indy by Meng, national President of brotherhood in order to ask council, as Police Chief Chris Wagner described at the press conference.
“At this moment the members of brotherhood began to hide the personal effects, actually, placing the welfare of the brotherhood higher than Michael Deng's health”, said chief Wagner.
They could not save it, and it passed away to the following morning.
According to report about the opening, Deng obtained several dull injuries of head, body and thighs.
“Too many families suffered as a result of the rituals of dedication into the brotherhood, since as the minimum one student dies during them each year, beginning from 1970”, said in his statement Douglas Fayerberg, attorney, who represents the family of Deng.
Brotherhood their terms must bear responsibility, and this step from the side of authorities is very important.
The jurors of the county Monroe were inclined in favor of the charge in the murder of the third degree for the first five members.
Other two thirty terms, including Maj. Meng, will obtain charge in violence against the newcomer and criminal agreement.
“We want to summon not only individual participants, but, if there is an organization, which sanctioned all this officially or unofficially, then it”, stated Wagner at the press conference on Tuesday.
The college of Baruch forbade brotherhood, and general national brotherhood excluded from its structure local department.
Which will happen, when the Federal Reserve raises the interest rates
An increase in the rates will happen, and “the market for bulls” it will stumble, returns of bonds will grow, and the economy will fall down into the recession.
This we know.
What we do not know, so this how long will pass before the offensive, and as for long this will continue.
Specifically for the economy history little that explains about the time.
Recession began only 11 months after the first increase in the rates and on entire 86 months.
The hardness of the Federal Reserve in raising of rates frequently, although not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore the administration of the Central Bank of the USA so persistently emphasizes that the investors must not be focused on that, when it begins to raise rates, but on that, adaptation how much will engage.
In fact, in the game the set of variables.
Finally, however, participants in the market can reveal that entire fuss around an increase in the rates proves to be exaggerated.
“The first increase in the rates by the Federal Reserve with the offensive of the global financial crisis will be unavoidable to be interpreted by some as the signal of the end of the era “cheap money”, reported Julian Dzhessop, chief specialist in the international economy in Capital Economics, in their commentary for the clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of the interest rates in the USA to the more normal, but still low levels will be the seismic pulse, which many fear.
This does not mean, however, that consequences it will not be.
Here is view on that, as some regions of the economy depending on the historical currents could react:
As already saw market in the last month or near that, the expectation of an increase in the rates can lead to the instability for some time.
With an increase in the rate, however, the consequences usually not such are dramatic.
“It is unlike so that the incomes from the actions of pritormozili for 12-24 months after the first jump, which, in addition, is probable, it reflects delay in the monetary policy” - said the analysts of Deutsche Bank in the recent study of the results of increasing the rates by the Federal Reserve.
If it is more concrete, market in the last approximately 35 years more frequently sharply changes - about 14 percent - to the side of an increase in the rates, remains sufficiently to flat during 250 days after this (medium height in 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returns to the normal state with average returns 14.4 percent in the last six cycles, according to the recent analysis, carried out by Bob Doll, chief specialist in strategy of trade in actions in to Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron ' s.
In Deutsche they indicate that the result for securities has a tendency immediately not to become more expressed in the stage of an increase in the rates, and incomes from the actions begin to decrease.
Recessions are the fact of economic life, but increases in the rates frequently play to them they contribute.
In this case the Federal Reserve is set in such conditions, which did not exist earlier and they can accelerate recession.
In essence, gross domestic product it will be located almost at its lowest point in the entire lifetime of the increased rate.
On the assertion of Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of povyshenya of the rates since 1950 of only twice nominal annual GDP [Gross Domestic Product] it was below 4.5 percent.
Even although in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, almost no one believes in the fact that this for a long time, with the fact that in the third quarter it is held at the level of only 1.5 percent, according to the data of Atlanta Fed.
An increase in the rates on such unstable economic background can be risky and is raised the question “will be in this time differently”, they reported in Deutsche.
Participants in the market are prepared for an increase in the rates with the Federal Reserve entire year, in this case their view is riveted to the session of the federal committee of the open market, which concludes on Thursday.
Thus far many specialists in strategies and economists consider that FOMC could affirm an increase in the rates at this session, futures trade speaks about the only 25-percent probability.
“In our study since 1950 all cycles of an increase in the rates to the present day were located in the super-cycle of the being increased financial lever with the GDP [Gross Domestic Product], which overlaps the peaks, which anticipate recession, it is very rapid after the beginning of restoration”, it is said in the report.
On the contrast, this was extremely slow restoration after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle at the given moment - longest, which the Federal Reserve waited from the end of the last recession; record was 35 months, in all it lasts already 74 months and yet it did not end.
The fixed income also became unstable while market it expects an increase in the rates, and this scenario is somehow similar to that, which realizes for the actions.
Fundamental difference is such, which into for the bonds the effect nastupet more rapidly than for the actions, when federal system alters strategic course.
In the case of bonds it is it seems that returns changes vector immediately after the offensive of the first increase/in the decrease of rates in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of an increase in the rates returns of bonds immediately falls”, Deutsche reports.
Specialists in strategy from Charles Schwab believe that an increase in the rates will lead to the fact that returns levels of long-term and short term bonds will draw together, after making curve of flatter.
Bonds with high returns frequently of Veduta themselves are better in this climate, although “we still fear the fluctuations of returns”, is said in a study To keti Jones, the analyst of the fixed income in Schwab.
It is interesting that Jones considers that the markets has already been adapted to the expected results of the policy of federal system.
“In addition to strengthening of dollar and drop in the inflationary expectations are signs of the fact that the market tuned to the prospect for more rigid monetary policy”, it wrote.
The interest rates on the short term loans rose, returns curve flatter, credit spredy were enlarged, volatility increased - all characteristics of market with the stiffening of the policy of federal system.
Speaking on the whole, companies, which lead basic their business in the USA, will win from an increase in the interest rates, and local production will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts will prove to be in the worse position, since the growing dollar makes their production more with road in the world market space, and their debt to more expensive - in the financial.
“History shows that “the qualitative” actions demonstrate the effectiveness higher than the market in the course of three months after an initial increase in the rates”, said the analysts of Goldman Sachs in the report for the clients.
Companies with the stable financial state went around companies with the unstable state according to the results of each increase in the rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 on the average to 5 percent points.
Companies with high returns of capital, and also action with the low volatility also showed the best effectiveness, than the action of low quality, on the average to 4 (percentage of point) and 3 (percentage of point) respectively.
Debt will become a large question.
Companies with the high percentage of debt with the floating rate will lose Goldman most of all according to.
Besides the purely stock exchange transactions, the users will obtain benefit from the growing dollar.
Depositors could see profit also through higher returns, although the experts disperse in that, how rapidly this will occur.
“BBC Radio 3- the copy of Classic FM”, asserts member of Parliament from the conservatives Andrew Bingkham
The member of parliament from the conservatives Andrew Bingkham criticized severely station after “reduction in the standards”
It proves, that it becomes increasingly less otlichimoy from the commercial competitor
Also it was aimed at BBC Music Awards, indicating that the reward is simply stripped from Brits
Colleague on the parliament of Damien Collins, who attacked himself The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
“BBC Radio 3 is converted in Classic FM”, stated the leader of members of Parliament, impelling TV and Radio company to prove that it makes anything although, what do not make commercial companies.
The member of parliament from the conservatives Andrew Bingkham also stated to the management of BBC that it seems, as if public radio station “becomes stupid” and becomes everything less otlichimoy from its commercial competitor.
“Radio 3 seems - me does not please to use a word “simplification” -, but it seems, it is converted in Classic FM”, he said.
It also was aimed at the reward of BBC Music Awards, neglected in the past December.
BBC Music Awards, which started in the past year, looks like The Brits under another name.
So that if you attempt to make something something different - here two examples, that first they arrived to me to the mind, in which you in reality only copy that the fact that already there is on the market”, said Maj. to Bingkham.
The Director-General of BBC rejected charges, asserting that BBC Radio 3 goes far in front of its commercial rival, when the matter concerns living music and formation of audience.
That that I learn because of Radio 3, I learn about classical music more nowhere.
And its devotion to living appearances and to the creation of music in reality will be compared more not with whom.
“Also it is actually very important, I think, the interest of Radio 3 in the search for new music and in the advance of new works”, he said.
Earlier in this year the manager of BBC Radio 3 Alan Deyvi asserted that for radio stations he is necessary to work much more in order to draw audience, than in the past, because Britons are less formed in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was the not only creation of BBC, which underwent the attacks for the advance to the heels to commercial competitors during the hearings of special committee on culture, mass media and sport.
The member of parliament from the Tory of Demien Collins attacked on The Voice - the musical show of talents, which BBC redeemed in Dutch Talpa Media for the tentative price into 22 million of pounds sterling.
You do see, why this program frequently is discussed in connection with the absence of originality and distinguishing features?

In the past month was noted the slowest increase, since they began to observe in 2000 it
Online-sales were activated three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shoppinga
Experts are convinced that November black Friday could contribute to the restraining of the expenditures

This meant that still more than people was obtained the opportunity to buy online, and that they could make this under any conditions, for example, sitting on the sofa.

In the past year buyers in a quantity five times of more than average hurried to the computers in order to have time to use advantageous proposals, after bringing thus the number down of the websites of salesmen.

As far as such goods as televisions and washing machines are concerned, it is more than one third of them is sold through the Internet stores.

Interrogation of 80 economists, carried out Reuters, revealed, which only is more than half of those, who still last week considered that the Federal Reserve to this will go, now they assume that it still will wait a while and will preserve rate at the level of the current range of 0-0,25 percent.

On the solution it will be declared in 20.00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go in the European Union through Croatia.
“Open!” - scan hundreds of refugees in the check point of Khorgosh on the Serbian-Hungarian boundary.
Since Tuesday Budapest overlapped boundary for the migrants.
The finders of refuge already begin to probe the different versions of routes into the European Union.
One of them around the closed boundary with Serbia lies through Rumania.
Another - through Croatia and Slovenia - into Austria.
According to some data, the buses, which conveyed refugees from Serbia to Hungary, now are bound toward the city Shidu on the Croatian boundary.
Drivers obtained order from the authorities to follow without the stoppages.
The Serbian minister of internal affairs of Neboysha Stepanovich certifies, that his country does everything on it depending in order to help refugees, but its opportunities are limited:
Our work consists in securing of Serbia as far as possible.
From the other side, we must also help these people, ensure relation humane to them.
But this is already Pan-European problem.
To solve no his is complex, country in Europe into the lone person this will manage, and by all the more this small country as Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open boundary for the refugees, who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Premier Victor Orban is inflexible:
If someone is named by refugee, in Serbia it must fill documents necessary for this.
But if it this does not make, then they will not admit into his our country, because in Serbia it is completely safe.
Hungary already elevated 175-tikilometrovyy fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban on this to stop is not intended: it plans announce the same barrage on the border with Rumania.
Bucharest already stated that this is incompatible with the European principles.
Vangelis Meymarakis: “Europe wants us to help”.
Vangelis Meymarakis over a number of years entered into the right-centrist governments, which led, in the opinion of the leftists, the country to the financial crisis.
Now it, after becoming the temporary leader of party “new democracy”, throws call Tsiprasu.
After several days to the elections it met with the journalist Evronyus.
Evronyus: Mr. Meymarakis, good to grant to Evronyus!
Vangelis Meymarakis: I thank for the invitation.
Evronyus: Nine months ago your party suffered crushing defeat, after yielding the coalition of SYRIZA [Coalition of the Radical Left], but now, judging by the interrogations, “new democracy” it was equaled with it on the popularity.
What did change in this time?
Vangelis Meymarakis: Changed Greece, and we also.
Mr. Tsipras much lied in January last year.
Nine months ago Greece had the surplus of budget and prospect for economic growth.
Now the country has again budget gap and the high unemployment rate.
Investors left, because Mr. Tsipras drove away them.
In the recent nine months the Greeks had the opportunity to estimate the position, in which the country was in January, and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare that promised with the fact that it occurred in reality.
Daily life became noticeably worse on the comparison since January, when situation was improved, moreover this concerned the majority of Greek citizens.
Evronyus: But you say that in the case of victory on the elections you will approach unions with other parties, including SIRIZu.
Vangelis Meymarakis: The fact is that, as we understood in recent years, Greece cannot advance without the understanding and collaboration.
And it is not accidental that in all other countries, where they acted or still act programs on the rescuing, political forces and all ruling parties were collected together in order to realize the program, according to which they reached agreement, without rejecting in this case its political or ideological autonomy.
This is why I solidly believe that the only collaboration of political forces and institutes will allow the country to go forward in the current stage.
Evronyus: Your party voted in the support of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and creditors of the country.
If on Monday you will become new Premier, will you carry out this agreement, or you will attempt to change him, at least, partly?
Vangelis Meymarakis: In reality we voted for the motion of Greece along the European way, because we represent well, to what disastrous effects would lead the output of the country from the European Union.
Now Europe helps us, allowing to subsidy to our farmers for their production, there are funds for solidarity, the packet of cadet and aid in the banking sector.
All this would be lost, if there would be no agreement with Europe.
But the current measures of austerity became the result of that how Mr. Tsipras it conducted negotiations.
I know that Europe does not desire us to destroy.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees, that the new Greek government during the first year in authority wants visit order, it acts rationally and it gives to understand that the country has a strong political will on the implementation of the program of rescuing, then, I it is confident, all obligations accepted, which cannot be executed because they lead to the recession, they can again become the object of negotiations, but only after the specific time.
It would be erroneous to assume that already in the first year of the operation of new agreement we will be able to return to the negotiations with our creditors, since they expect the complete fulfillment of understanding.
If we want to return their confidence, we must continue privatization, reforms and structural changes, which were agreed on, continuing to use the advantages of financing the European Union and great investment opportunitys, which we must open for the best understanding and collaboration with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of negotiations the government of Tsiprasa presented no serious arguments on many key political questions, that we explained, discussing these questions with our European colleagues.
I can give the example, connected with the incomes of farmers.
We explained to our European partners that the discussion does not deal with the fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be assessed completely tax previously.
They answered us, that the ministers Tsiprasa never about this spoke.
I.e., Greek ministers were not prepared and badly informed, but therefore negotiations unsuccessfully conducted and concluded unsuccessful agreement.
Evronyus: If you pobedit on the elections, then soon you will prove to be after one table with Mr. Yunkerom, Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will differ the fact that you to them will say, from the fact that did tell in them your predecessor Antonis Samaras?
Vangelis Meymarakis: First of all, I will explain by them that prior to the end of 2014 we attempted to in the best way carry out the agreement of 2012, going around sharp angles the available in it.
We advanced reforms.
Certainly, to us was not sufficient the necessary resoluteness and rapidity, but we acted in the extraordinary situations.
Market fell, and it was not evidently potential buyers, ready to pay the price, which arranged Greek government.
I at that time was the speaker of parliament, for me government majority was possible to agree on opinions of three parliamentary groups, which comprised then.
And in spite of their serious ideological differences on the key bills, we had the working parliament, and this in the presence of Populists and extremists, and also mass demonstrations, which passed outside.
And we succeeded in deriving the country to the normal situation, which would continue to be improved, if process was not interrupted by early general election, which became the result of December presidential elections.
Evronyus: Recent weeks along the territory of Greece moves the mass flow of refugees.
What you do think about this situation, and about the reaction of the European Countries, into which do strive these people?
Vangelis Meymarakis: Crisis with the refugees - this is the time bomb, with which for us one must deal after victory on the elections.
But reason in the fact that the government of SYRIZA [Coalition of the Radical Left] did not act in this situation in the manner that it followed.
In such questions one should act on the lead, because, if problem overtakes you, then only extraordinary measures remain.
And we now precisely in this situation.
Even the provisional government, which replaced SIRIZu, only in seven days made more than Mr. Tsipras it made in seven months.
I am confident, that these actions of provisional government, which renders valuable aid the President of republic, who called to conduct summit the European Union, will make it possible to find the solution.
We should see, how many refugees they can leave the country, and note - refugees not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of war in Syria, the victim of some extraordinary events, which occurred with them.
This question is had deeply the humanitarian aspect, and we will adhere to position, which the European politicians must accept in this new situation.
The corresponding solution must be accepted by the summit the European Union, must be implicated the United Nations.
To us also is required the best coordination of actions, more effective border control and centers on the reception of refugees.
We also must effectively use the economic aid, which we obtain from the European Union in order to be in the state to manage this vital problem.
Evronyus: Mr. Meymarakis, thanks for the interview.
Vangelis Meymarakis: I thank you.

Stars, which lost their success
Actor (to the left), in the photograph with his son by Redmond (to the right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001 it fought with leukemia, while into 2009 it lost its long-standing companion of life to Farr Fawcett, dead person from cancer.
As it communicates, actor also suffered from drug dependence, and in 2008 they arrested for the storage of narcotics.
All this undoubtedly played its role.
The hatchway of Shaw from Manchester United retired by several months because of the dual break
Shaw's hatchway broke right foot in two places during the match of the League of Champions, in which Manchester United lost PSV in Eyndkhovene.
While the defender survives in regard to this, because of whom he will not be able to leave in the field at least in the course of six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able again to play in this season.
Injury occurred during reckless rough stock of Hector Moreno for the 15th minute, when 20-year Shaw broke into the penal zone of PSV.
It they rendered aid in the field during nine minutes and gave oxygen before to drive away into the hospital.
Van Gal said: “It has dual break, and he in the hospital”.
It they will transport into Manchester tomorrow or in the daytime later, and then will operate.
This is terrible - youth arrived in Manchester United at the age of 18 years, he overcame great difficulties and it began to play fantastically, and here this happened.
In the cloakroom on it there was oxygen mask.
It cried.
I am not doctor, but if you have dual break, then this for six months, and fellow will not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope that he will be able again to play in this season.
Moraine transported, that it did not obtain red card and it was not assigned penalty.
The arbiter of Nicolas Ritstsoli did not punish Mexican.
Van Gal considers that the Italian judge committed error.
You judge themselves, when I say that this costs penalty and red card.
This was very bad rough stock from two feet.
In his Twitter Shaw writes: “Thanks with all for your communications, by words not to describe, as I am devastated, my way to the restoration begins, I will return still stronger than it was”.
Even on the theme: Manchester United survives misfortune with Shaw's hatchway with the defeat in the game from PSV
The defender of Englishmen will have the extra incentive to get well for the championship of Europe in France in following June.
Fillip to spinner, the trainer of PSV, he said: “This is very severe injury”.
When any player retires with a similar injury, all is very detuned by this.
This never was by the intention of our players - traumatize enemy.
Moraine transferred the break of the foot, when Van Galya on the world championship of 2014 played for Mexico against the command of Holland under the management.
“To it now very difficultly, since he did not have the intention to wound enemy, and when you hear, that this is very severe injury, then you feel itself badly”, it said to spinner.
I did not have an opportunity to see moment itself.
Only, that I could see, this is the ball, which flew in other direction, so that this appeared, as if it (moraine) touched it, but I did not see rough stock under hatchway.
In the conversation with SBS6 of moraines he said: “I know that this such, I know, as it is difficult to transfer this.
To me it is very heavy, and to me it is very it's a pity.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also delivered into the hospital after collision with Chris Smolling.
Does know David Cameron about “Lorakse” anything still?
Each parent very rapidly masters one thing: if some book was pleased to your child, it will pass a little time, before you will retire to know it almost by heart.
Apparently, if only you not David Cameron.
Answering a question of the representative of company, which carries out the organization of children's leisure in the vacations, about his dear children's book, the Prime Minister selected “Loraks” - the fairy tale with the ecological incline, written by Dr. Syuz in 1971.
This was difficult selection, wrote Cameron in the commentary, published on the site of the company of SuperCamps, and it continues: “This merry, touching, uncommon history with the strong message I love to read my children, because in it is always revealed any means or the message, which we pass.”
And everything is good, except the last paragraph, in which Cameron, as it is assumed, retells the maintenance of book, but in reality says the subject of the similar film, taken in 2012, with the new characters and details, added, in order to diversify sufficiently short original narration.
“In the surrounded by high walls city of Vsemnuzhvill, where there was no verdure whatever and even air was sold for the money, boy by the name of Ted hopes to conquer the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dream, after carrying out its desire - to see the present tree”, we read in the text the description of amorous history, to unknown Dr. Syuzu (present name Theodore Syuz Geyzel), to dead person in 1991.
If this appears insufficient to suspicious, Cameron's text is read almost as the brief account of the subject of film “Loraks”, lined on the site of Internet Movie Database: “In the surrounded by high walls city of Vsemnuzhvill, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for the money, boy by the name of Ted hopes to conquer the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dream.”
It seems improbable that Cameron, being, by the general acknowledgement, by active parent, is so not familiar with the maintenance of the book, in which not named by the name of boy learns about how destroys environment greedy vyrubshchik of trees and the binder “of vsemnuzhek” of Nakhodkins, in spite of the protests of Loraksa (whose name it is carried out into the name of the book) - ridiculous essence with the whiskers, which “speaks on behalf trees”.
Most likely, this simple Pr-task was charged to executor, never read child book about Loraksa of 20 times contract.
The representative of Downing Street she stated that the text was supposedly obtained from Cameron's office in the constituency.
The company of SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from the staff of Cameron, but further commentaries it did not follow.
For Adam Lita clearly there was a risk not to fall into the team of England, but this the still complex question
The victory above Pakistan in the united Arab emirates - complex task, but if we look to the composite, which England selected for this tour, the repetition of the defeat in a test series with the score 3-0, which was happened past time, does not seem me likely.
I also did not exclude victory in my field.
The command of Cook's Alistera is, possibly, less experimental than that it was three years ago, but in it among those repulsing there are players, virtuoso assuming twisted balls, and collective thinking is strong; they will not bring with themselves scars of 2012, but only youthful positive.
With the ball of Moen of Ali is converted into the bowler, who gives twisted balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he unknown figure for the test level, is the attacking option.
Even on the theme: Adam Lit retired from team England on test kriketu and was substituted by Alex Kheylz
The solution about the exception of Adam Lita to me, to his head coach in “Yorkshire”, is of course complicated to analyze.
To its seven test matches it was necessary two good attacks under difficult conditions, and obvious, but brutal reality in the fact that players in kriket they are evaluated by judges according to result.
There were no questions concerning John Rutu, for example, that also it led to this declaration, because (and I already he spoke this earlier) players best anything select themselves.
Pair of fifties, and is cast it could wait more prolonged career, but it was in the authority of its own fate.
We hope that if it collects more than ranov for “Yorkshire”, will appear one additional opportunity.
The head coach team England, Trevor Beyliss, answered well about his attitude, even when he did not show that, to that it was capable, and this does not astonish me; it, first of all, command player, and is then narrower everything else.
A question, how long will pass before the batsman of test kriketa will leave about itself impression - a complex question.
It is cast it played in seven games as Sam Robson to it, and drooped Compton - in nine.
Only Compton obtained chance to play on his and in the strange field.
Only, on what you could complain - the fact that England she selected Jonathan Trotta for the Caribbean Premier League, when it was cast in the best form, but this lost opportunity already in the past.
Appears Alex Kheyls, and it betsman, which I evaluate highly.
It not predicted kriketist, that we saw in the Yorkshire club at the beginning of this season, when it earned 236 in the match against us on the area of Trent breeches, which was already something.
To it must be at least given the same opportunity, as thereby, who was to it, but this will be, certain, to depend on the composition of command in the United Arab Emirates.
The thought to place Moena next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would afford the opportunity to introduce additional spinnera, after preserving four high-speed bowlers, is considered, and I entirely not against this.
I do not see reasons, on which the beaten player cannot there repulse ball, but this left-hander already showed that he devilishly good kriketist.
Moen, possibly, not entirely that which is necessary for its county of Vustershir, but it became the third number for them, and there is no large difference here.
My old comrade upon command Justin Langer played his first of 38 test matches “third batsman” before leaving as that opening in 2001.
It won immediately three hundreds and was not examined.
Zafar Ansari comes into the composite as reserve spinner, and with my short with it communication he seemed me by the very promising young person.
People can look to its exemplary statistics - on the average 31 with that beaten and 35 with the ball - and think that this is the risky rate, but among spinnerov of those voting “after” a little, and those selecting selected youth.
It will learn to much in this tour.
Besides the team, England plans to make a pair of practical additions into the trenerskiy composition.
The designation of Makhely Dzhayauordina, Sri Lanka batsman, as the consultant for the test matches, could be workshop motion.
It is one of the best fellows for the game, which will introduce into it the richest experience, obtained with all possible conditions and in any attacks.
The gender of Kollingvud is included in those games, where white ball is used, and will ensure both energy and merciless rate in setape.
I always felt, that he was born in order to be enabled in the international you krikete, be it game or trenerskaya work, and as Makhela, it possesses big enough intellect.
Sometimes new voices in the cloakroom, even if they speak that which was already said earlier, they can give new forces to command.
The colleague of collies upon command of Durham Ben Stouks is left for odnodnevok, rue is given similar interruption in connection with Australia, and I do not, for example, experience in regard to this problems.
Although not all with this will agree, trainers and those, who select players, do not determine timetable.
And you must remember as players, their positions depend on results.
Such solutions never start easily.
The camp of the supporters of the output of Great Britain from the European Union can gain victory, if the economy will be in depression by 2017
Politician David Cameron's unconsidered on the resumption of negotiations about the retention of Britain in the European Union each day does experience increasingly more complexities, even without caution to the election there is no brilliant Jeremy “this yes or? ” - Korbina by the leader of laborists or the indignation of TUC apropos of Europe on Tuesday.
In foreigners are also their Korbiny Naydzhely to Faradzhi.
Friendly European diplomat explained recently that with that position, in which is located now the European Union, which survives diverse crises - not all of them its own production - some participating countries they are satisfied on the throat by the British egocentric agenda of the sowing strifes concessions and undermining understandings changes, which they in essence do not want.
After being gathered in brighton to the yearly meeting, TUC solved, that he does not want them in any event, if they destroy social protection.
We could even name this “the program of selfi Deyva and George”.
The Premier and finance minister roll themselves on the summits and double-sided sessions in the foreign capitals, they photograph themselves against the background known local monument, in the company of local celebrity or without it, then they arrive they home and indicate that they draw allies for the reform.
This are all about me.
My European friend, who wants interested in the maintenance of external communications Britain under the awning of the European Union - do not " leave us together with France”, speaks Berlin - it proposes, so that the zashorennye ministers and officials in some capitals would reach the understanding, when it will become them nevertheless, we will remain or let us leave.
Angela Merkel, the very careful chancellor of Germany, ally, but it is in power of 10 years and wants to leave office before situation for it will deteriorate, as it deteriorated for those sitting too long at its place Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrana (14) and splitting (16).
Head Francium Francois Hollande stands before the re-elections or replacement in 2017.
It also loses force.
Poland can soon obtain the nationalistic government of right sense, Spain - leftist.
It is heavy to see their climbing from the skin there in order to help “selfi-britam”, whose energy could be spent on avertings of the output of Scotland from Great Britain - what they they also do not want, because the majority is had similar separatist tendencies.
So that some such ministers can even plan delivery intended useless remarks in the style of SNP during the campaign of referendum in Great Britain in 2017 in order to whip the process of the output of Great Britain from the European Union, my friend assumes.
“Revision was obsession” and “Britain nothing valuable obtained from the renewed negotiations”.
Europeans to their trouble know, by what predator there can be Flit-Street, and as skeptically with respect to the European Union are disposed media magnates, in contrast to the times of zapushchenogo by Tony Benn the referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 by relationship 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, deep-rooted Euro-opportunist, who became famous herself by his “straight bananas the European Union” of Brussels correspondent at the beginning of the 90th.
Eudes Milliband knew with his entire stupidity, who its enemies.
They included motley company from cheats the afraid of taxes, telephone hacker-strangers also of the pseudos-nonresident, which manage the majority of our large newspapers.
In reality Tony Blair was about them completely the same opinion, but it realized that when you are situated in the cell with the violent gorilla, you must return to it bananas in order to distract it and not to give to it to eat you to the lunch and again with the tea.
On the fact of Millibend there was the larger adherent of Blair, than Blair himself in the opposition to Cameron's idea about the referendum, since Blair was received by principles in favor of the abolished constitution the European Union, buried by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave out winning ticket to it.
Press anything from this to it forgave.
But Jeremy Korbin's milyaga, who friendly slapped me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I said to it that he greater does not have time in order to spend it on me - it is similar, risks to repeat strategy of the Nile Kinnoka “boycott to Murdock” from the 80th - error and then, and now.
This can engage time, but it must develop sequential strategy of interaction with the press - not with me, but it is completely accurately with Andrew Marr, on whose sofa in VVS it sat on Sunday.
The official position of Korbina on Europe - this that I delicately call evolution.
He speaks, he would want so that we would remain in the reformed European Union.
Actually, the majority of people beyond the limits of the tradiotsinalistskoy tendency of Ukip and wider circle “of the supporters of small England” among the Tory can, it is probable, to say to this “yes”.
This the same, what Hillary “Benna, but not bennit” - Benna said on the radio TV on this week, in this case its internal boy scout from all forces rejected to recognize that the designation unbearable John MDONNELL's Korbinom “shady” finance minister was poor idea.
This reminded me about the 70's, when his old father from all forces struggled on TV for neloyalnost to the colleagues on the Labor office, without going too far and without losing his post in the cabinet of ministers.
The battle of Hillary was more attractive.
But fight for first in order to remain “with any circumstances” - phrase Benna - not the fact that, spoke MDONNELL, and not that J. k. told peers and members of Parliament at the private meeting on Monday in the evening, in the universal opinion.
So that there not would want to report the Democrat and “your fellow” of Korbin - you remember, it touched even me - discipline of messages remains important into the century of the twenty-four hour television of seven days in the week, and especially in the whirlpool of social networks, center of paranoia and treachery.
This is reasonable - not to give to Cameron so it is simple to be finished from Europe, making possible for it to assume as proper the support of laborists during the campaign on conducting of referendum, as MDONNELL said.
Simon Jenkins definitely so thinks.
But the basic delusion of MDONNELL and Korbina apropos of membership in the European Union - within the framework of “bennitskoy” economy of the precipitated fortress - no longer is a question of esoteric discussion among the left dissidents, for whom nartsissizm, generated by insignificant difference, is central principle in the dogmatic disputes.
What its delusions apropos of NATO - that Watson is firm in the fact that George. k. will not campaign for the output - foreign diplomats will be obligated to attempt to report this to their leaders at home.
Why to Paris or to Berlin to spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to the concessions to Britain, when this all can be thoughtlessly?
The USA are already very disappointed by the weak military actions of Britons in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the fact that the government of Tory in authority urezaet expenditures, about which they reminded to me on Monday during the lunch on the certain forum by the name of British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the survey of electronic cigarette from Public Health England
The statements financed agency of the financed by government, that the electronic cigarettes to 95% are less harmful than smoking, sounded at the meeting 12 people, some of which were connected with the tobacco industry, as researchers reported.
Experts, who are published in British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized severely the proofs, used by the agency of Public Health England (PHE) in their report on the electronic cigarettes.
PHE published important report - “rotary landmark” in the past month, after naming it “the thorough survey of proofs”.
But some researchers placed for doubt the authenticity of the data and the connection of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In the editorial article in the medical periodical of Lancet in the past month they criticized severely “extremely unsteady reason”, on the basis of which PHE constructed its main conclusion.
In the article of BMJ two additional researchers asked the question, do have these statements under themselves “solid or unsteady bases”.
Martin Mackie, instructor of the organization of European public health in the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine, and Simon Keypvell, the instructor of clinical epidemiology at the Liverpool university, reported: “The fundamental principle of public health - rule they must have at the basis a proof of effectiveness”.
According to them, community expects, in order to the statement of PHE, that “the current best estimator shows that the electronic cigarettes approximately to 95% are less harmful how tobacco smoking” they were based on the detailed selection of proofs and simulation.
Actually, this is derived from the only meeting of 12 people, which gathered for developing the model of the multikriterialnogo analysis of decision making in order to generalize their opinions about the harm, connected with different nicotinecontaining products; the results of meeting briefly are given in the scientific publication.
Mackie and Keypvell reported that one of the sponsors of meeting was the company by the name of EuroSwiss Health, about Director-General of which it communicated that earlier it obtained financing from British American Tobacco for the independent study.
It also confirmed the certificates of BAT in the sphere of public health in the report about the steady development.
One of 12 people at the meeting declared about the financing from the producer of electronic cigarette, without mentioning about that financing, which it, as it communicates, previously obtained from the tobacco company of Philip Morris.
The reasonable explanation of the selection of Council members was not given, but among them there are several well-known supporters of electronic cigarette, some of whom also stated about financing of industry in the publication.
It is unknown, is Li Wu other participants in the meeting the experience of control in the tobacco matter.
The leader of tobacco direction in PHE also visited meeting.
The scientific article, published by group, “elegant agrees” with the fact that there is a deficiency “in valid proofs of the harmful effect of the majority of products on the majority of criteria”, wrote Mackie and Keypvell.
However, none of these connections and limitations were touched upon in the report to PHE.
Mackie and Keypvell described that the statement of PHE, that “at the present moment there are no proofs that the electronic cigarettes are expensive, that leads children or not smoking to smoking”, are premature.
To Prof. Kevin Fenton, the leader of direction on the health and prosperity in PHE, described that for the statements of BMJ the answers earlier has already been given.
It described: “Electronic cigarettes are substantially less harmful than tobacco smoking”.
One of entire two those smoked life died of its predilection.
All proofs imply that the threats to health from the electronic cigarette are comparatively small, but we must continue to study the distant consequences.
PHE has a clear responsibility on public information relative to the fact that they prove and what do not prove these proofs, especially, where the public had doubts apropos of the relative danger about the comparison with the tobacco.
About 80 000 people per year die from the diseases, connected with smoking, and smoking bypasses NHS into 2 billion pounds per year.
Having clearly designated obvious - that although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they bring only the part of the harm, applied by smoking - we accomplish our tasks before the nation.
Been the head of Channel 4 considers that the company of BBC must end the series of EastEnders
Been the head of Channel 4 hatchway Johnson considers that BBC should be ended the release of such programs as EastEnders and The Voice, after noting that their competitors on the business much would return for such successful of show as the soap opera about “area of Albert”.
Johnson noted that the license fees must be used only for creating such programs, which are not let out by other British TV and Radio companies.
It came out with the criticism of BBC for the fact that the company places the transfers of the public broadcasting, which for sure looks the only small part of the audience, to the peak ether period, when in competitors they go show with the high rating, and on such channels as BBC4.
After the general director of BBC Tony Hall said that the corporation would want more to collaborate with other organizations, Johnson noted that he in his time for six years unsuccessfully attempted to fix collaboration from BBC during the work on Channel 4.
“I cannot be finished from the thought, that BBC prepares for the starting and it transmits the transfers, which could show the competing companies, which do not obtain subsidies”, described Johnson to committee members on the communication of the Chamber of Lords within the framework of the explanation of further fate of BBC.
If you preserve the license fee, that I do not consider as the good solution in the average and long-term outlook, then companies should be left in ether only those programs, which are not let out and are not collected to be let out by other companies.
Shaw The Voice leaves into ether in the Prime-slot, because creators want to obtain a maximally possible support to the future.
Idea so that no one more it would show, it was laughable and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I do not understand, why regressive taxes must go for financing of the transfers, which could be sponsored without the subsidies.
The Voice - one such example, EastEnders - another; it is widely-known that they are their own productions.
Other channels, undoubtedly, much for it returned.
I do not understand, as this can be public broadcasting.
I do not think that this would somehow minimize BBC.
Series owner Johnson, who headed the channel of Channel 4 since 2004 until 2010, accused BBC in pursuit of ratings “because of the ambitions of colleagues and because of their faith in the fact that this is the best method to obtain support for the long term”.
Its commentaries about the popular of show on BBC agree with the commentaries of the executive director of Sky Tony Ball, who in his lecture of the memory of MakTaggarta in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed BBC to sell series of the type of EastEnders.
Johnson noted that more the recessed transfers of BBC of public nature “continue to go on BBC4, where frequently it is not possible to estimate audience, but the function of company is executed, and this can be produced as the argument in the bigoted sermons, which justify income from the license fees into 4 billion pounds: “well yes, certainly, we make all these incomprehensible transfers, which no one looks”.
They place them in the slot, where no one will never look them.
Apropos of the license fee Johnson reported the following to committee: “I issue a call you to find more regressive system in the fact that it concerns, who most of all will obtain from it.
Certainly, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds per year - enormous sum, but for the people, for which 150 pounds - large money, to me it is interesting, they so count because they very they do not look and they listen to BBC.
The former executive director of the channels of Sky and Channel 5 David Elsteyn, who also appeared before the committee last Tuesday, said that BBC must reexamine the mission of Rita in favor “inform, enlighten and entertain”.
It noted that now the only insignificant part of produced BBC materials formally is classified as educational - according to him, this 1% of television content and 0.1% on the radio- and that the company must catch the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies under the motto “inform, enlighten and entertain”.
On questions of the partnership of Elsteyn it noted that BBC one should make more than efforts in such spheres as “Promenadnye concerts” (only part of them, according to him, shows on TV), and also enter into the alliances with the commercial broadcasting companies in order to make them accessible for the survey an online.
“Sonogenetika” makes it possible to govern the cells of the brain with the aid of the acoustic waves
Evidently on the videotape, as nematodes change direction of motion at the moment, when they undergo the action of sound pulses.
Scientists derived worms with the genetically modified nervous system, which it is possible to govern, using ispulsy of acoustic waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction of motion at that moment, when on them they act by sound pulses, by too high that the human ear could hear them.
Pulses exert the influence by activating the neurons, genetically modified in order to use the diaphragm channels, which react to the ultrasonic waves.
Even on the theme: Researchers govern cerebral activity with the aid of the light
Scientists described that the worms demonstrate the opportunity of new procedure by the name “sonogenetika”, whose essence consists in the use of an ultrasound for the excitement of the specific cells of the brain, heart and muscles, in this case the source of ultrasound is arranged out of the organism.
Shrikant to Chalasani, scientific worker in the institute salting, la-Khoyya, California, described to Guardian that this procedure could once replace the deep stimulation of the brain - invazivnuyu procedure, with which into the brain of man electric pulses are sent and which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Worm-nematodes usually do not react to the ultrasound, but Chalasani it revealed that they began to react, when they were placed into the liquid, which contains microscopic phials.
It revealed that the phials strengthen the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the organism of worms.
The intensive ultrasonic waves act on the structures, called “ionic channels TRP-4”, discovered in the membranes of some cells of worms.
Ultrasonic waves force these ionic channels to be opened and excite the cells, which are connected with them, it communicates in the report in Nature Communications.
For the creation the nematode, which it is possible to govern by means of the ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic of the modifications of worms, so that their engine neuron used ionic channels TRP-4.
During the application of an ultrasound for the action on the modified organisms acoustic waves were strengthened by microscopic phials and were introduced into the organisms of worms, activating the modified engine neurons.
This procedure is similar to that, which adapts in “the opto-geneticist” - the new direction, which makes possible for scientists to include and to turn off neurons with the aid of the light pulses.
Of Chalasani it asserts that in comparison with this procedure of sonogenetika it can have some advantages.
In contrast to the light, which is reached to the necessary section of the brain on optovoloknu, low-frequency ultrasonic waves without difficulty penetrate the tissues of organism; therefore for their delivery it is not necessary to pass inside the cranium.
“We consider that for treating some neurologic illnesses in the clinical conditions the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to the period to make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasonic signal”, it described Chalasani.
It added that, besides this, the procedure can be applied to the muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Forbidden torture equipment - directly on your threshold!
Advertising declarations jeer above the British trade in the weapon
You look the roller of Amnesty International with the protest against the exhibition of weapon.
Staggering drony-killers!
The destroying shin iron are shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electrical light-noise bludgeons, which cause the intolerable pain, but which do not leave tracks!
Cheerful voice and sketched animation do not leave doubts, that this advertisement of the largest international exhibition of weapon - caustic parody, prepared of Amnesty International for the purpose to draw attention to the intention of the British Government “to push” weapon to repressive regimes, after using exhibition of defense technologies and security systems the passing in the center of ExCeL in Doklendse.
Even on the theme: Exhibition of the weapons of DSEI: authoritarian regimes will go to London
But special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of a set of posters on the bus stops and in the subway trains, which require looking on them again.
“Important declaration, to edushchim along the line DLR with 15 until September 18?” - is written on one of them by types of the London metro with the image of the line DLR, which is converted into the silhouette of tank.
In September this year the crowd of the merchants of weapon will come unexpectedly to the line of DLR. Passengers they request to help to prevent the exhibition of weapon.
300 posters are drawn by the artists, who advanced their works in “the museum of brutal design” in the park of Benksi “of Dismalend”.
The association by the name group “special patrol” helped to extend on London, using them “the collection of the burglar of advertising places”, the 6-pound collection of open-end wrenches, which, as it is declared, “gives access approximately to third of advertising space on the bus stops of planet”.
To the transport workers of London it is sad from this “vandalism” in the form of the unsanctioned posters.
One of the parodical declarations, released by group “special patrol”.
According to Gevina Grindona, the moderator of the exhibition of Cruel Designs and instructor at the Essex university, the artists become more demanding and strive to report political art to the audience beyond the limits of galleries.
Many artists begin to work with the activists of protest motions, understanding, which them is necessary to leave into the real world for its art, if they want to influence society.
One additional poster against the exhibition of weapons, which greets passengers in the metro.
Video from Amnesty was examined more than 100 000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and is created by the agency of VCCP, which works pro bono, with the attraction of graphic designer and artist of sounding, also working free of charge.
The creative director of VCCP Mett Lever was struck by advertising silence around the exhibition of weapons - with the passage in the calendar of ExCel - and thought: “Give let us arrange to them the campaign, which they try to avoid”.
They thought to create more realistic and craftier corporate advertisement, but “to fill its houses by bright colors and animation proved to be the more gripping lesson”.
“They improbably helped us to draw attention to sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition”, says that Deyvis from Amnesty.
Now to us it is necessary that the government of Great Britain would take measures and it guaranteed, that this torture equipment will not be sold illegally directly in our threshold.
Possibly, most creative art on the theme of the exhibition of weapons goes from within ExCeL, where the participants deal in fantastically evfemesticheskoy production.
In the press release of Saab it opened information about the order on “AT4CS of RS for the shooting from the arm”, that entered from the U.S. Army.
It includes the not having analogs cumulative warhead, which " brings the unsurpassed action inside the purpose behind the armor”.
What it not made, this will not be pleasant.
Eight gold rules of stay in the student hostels
It already passed 11 years from those times, as I moved to the student hostel as normal 19-year person, who still believes in berety and moral relativity, but only now I recall the stretched smiles of those, whom I irritated - and numerous, long complaints on others.
In essence that, to what I learned, it is possible to decompose according to eight simple rules.
Passage into the hostel can vary from that slightly acting on the nerves to that absolutely frightening.
It impels to stir: to tell people, from where you, did take you academic leave and where it was conducted, you do support Korbina and why you “is honest, neither I love nor I hate “Marmayt”, because, it is serious, children, this simply yeast extract KHAKHAKHA, I will have itself”.
Die.
And help to others to die also - pose questions and demonstrate interest.
This supports conversation and it helps you to find people, which you please, but not those, with which you even would not begin to talk, even if in you caught fire eyelashes, but they would give fire extinguishers out.
Give space to people.
The rooms of people frequently are converted into the saloon institutions, midnight film auditoriums and places of general get-togethers, but they also the place, where the people dress and repair the underwear.
Even on the theme: Even do not think to begin studies at the university, being located in the relations
To at the universities they intro-faiththere relate incorrectly.
Your room must be refuge; however, many hostels form the culture of swaying of one room into another, which contributes to friendship, communication and leads to the long friendly relations.
This can be hell for that, who attempts to restore forces.
Nothing in the culture makes possible for you to say: “You me please, and I want to continue with you to be friends, but to me it is necessary that you would leave, and I could restore energy, which I spent on communication with you”.
Try to feel, when sokursnik is tired by communication - and not to knock to it, but to send SMS.
By the way, about the knock: make this.
One fellow in my hostel followed this principle: if door was not closed, then it they invited to enter.
It something saw.
Creeks of friends with the aid of the baking.
Since you begin university life on the peak of the popularity of the show of Bake-Off, to knock into the door to the people in order to be represented and to present the plate of chocolate pastry, no longer this strange action, so it does not resemble 1950-e years them “good to grant, we neighbors, I to you something baked, but now smile, but I will pose to you personal questions”.
To propose domestic entertainments - outstanding method to make friends.
Your neighbors they will feel, that they are obligated with you to chat, and as a result, probably, your face will be associated in them with the pleasant surprise.
Of course this depends on how you is a good baker.
The badly blinded lumps of flour, sugar and fat will rather force people to be shut by those sleeping, when you will to them knock.
Theft of food - typical crime in the student hostels.
Of course awarding someone's hen - theft, but perhaps this theft - to take to itself barely milk for the tea?
Manage in the owner of milk.
Most likely he will propose to you not to be troubled, even if inside it boils from the fury.
If someone steals your things, this it irritates, and I to you sympathize - but attempt to relate to this more adult than my neighbor, who filled into her milk liquid for the washing of dishes in order to take vengeance by the fact, who it took without to demand.
Now it in the prison.
You must not produce noise, which it will interfere with sleeping or learn people.
Not only in order to be decent person, but also because you those people themselves from the saying about the glass houses.
Girl in my corridor requested neighbor to diminish the sound of drum and bass-guitar, since had 3 hours of the morning, and it in the morning examination.
As the answer the neighbor increased loudness.
When it finally became silent in 5 mornings, it gracious allowed it to sleep two hours, and it then incised its music and locked after itself door, after leaving on the three-hour examination.
Not romantically whether it was, if your future husband did settle in the same hostel as you?
On the contrary, there would not be this extremely, before biting of elbows, it is clumsy, if you did accept neighbor for your future husband, she was absorbed in by it, did break relations and it must see his each day, and possible, to observe as it does stretch to its side of all your general friends?
Certainly, you will not order heart - but if hot of neighbor completely accurately not your future husband, try to slightly cool its own flame.
At that agitating moment, when you understand, that someone left keys inside its own closed room, division between drawing and hunting is thinner than it seems.
A good drawing - this is gay, but it is converted into its opposition in a few seconds.
Teach valuable and interesting lesson on the safety, after hiding anything - but never soil someone's room with tooth paste and shampoo.
Lock strange door and lower keys into the container with the water, which you will then place in the freezer - but do not stick strange things by glue of Blu-Tack on the ceiling of more than two times.
iOS 9: as to establish new operating system on iPhone after the release of renovation from Apple
New operating system can be inquired, after visiting into the application of Settings, to select for General, and then - Software Update.
If it is prepared, telephone will allow you to download it and to establish.
Some encountered problems after the installation, when the error message, which tells to them appears, that “the renovation of application did not succeed”.
In order to avoid this, to users it should be either waited, until ceases reanimation or to attempt to be updated through iTunes.
Prompts on the telephone will allow you to pass entire process to the end.
Process can include the removal of applications for an increase in the vacant place - but Apple minimized the probability of this action, after decreasing the size of renovation, and also simplified fulfillment with the aid of the special utility, which proposes to remove applications and to repeatedly repeatedly establish them after the completion of process.
It is worthwhile to be convinced of the fact that with the fulfillment of renovation your telephone is charged or is located next to the charger in order not to allow discharging battery.
If charge too low, Apple stops renovation, since discharging telephone in the process can lead to the failure of renovation.
To read further: iOS 9 leaves according to the plan, in spite of the delay of WatchOS the survey of iOS 9: the least impressive and better renovation of iOS 9: as to be prepared for the new operating system for iPhone
You one should ascertain that you examined our check-sheet of those actions, which must be undertaken before the running off in order to try and to force something to cease to go not so, and to be protected from this something, if this something went not then. In iOS 9 are now included new functions the, including improved personal assistant, and innovations, which increase the productivity of iPad, and also tuning, which increase the operating speed and correcting operating system.
Washington answered the military activity of Russia by telephone ringing.
The Secretary of State of the USA John Kerry rang to his Russian colleague to Sergey Lavrov in order to discuss situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support, which Moscow renders President Assad, it leads only to the aggravation of conflict.
At the same time Head of the White House thus far is not assembled to speak about this with the Russian colleague, PJ Media writes.
The Secretary of State of the USA John Kerry rang the minister of foreign affairs of Russia Sergey Lavrov, in order to discuss the military activity of Russia in Syria.
The publication of PJ Media reports about this.
“Secretary Kerry clearly gave to understand that further support of President Assad from the side of Russia creates the risk of aggravation and prolongation of conflict, and also negatively it affects our common purpose - fight with the extremism, if we also do not continue to be concentrated on the searches for the ways of resolution of Syrian conflict by the direct drive of authority”, stated the representatives of U.S. State Department.
They also noted that Kerry once again emphasized the adherence of the USA to fight with “Islamic state” within the framework of the coalition of more than 60 countries.
It also noted that President Assad never will be able to be its member.
Furthermore, the USA “will glad the design role of Russia in the attempts resist “Islamic state "".
Last Friday the representatives of the White House stated that they accurately do not know, what actions undertake Russian troops in Syria; however, Washington is assembled to discuss this question with Moscow.
However, press-secretary the White House of Dzhosh Ernest noted that the time for the telephone conversation between the President of the USA Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimirom Putinym thus far did not come: “When the President will solve, that the telephone conversation with President Putin will go for the benefit to our interests, then it raises tube and attempts to complete this bell”.
Barack Obama himself counts the solution of Russia to increase the support of Assad's regime “proigryshnoy rate”.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin of four or five years ago, when I said to it that this is error that further support of Assad will only worsen situation.
“But it did not listen to my warnings - and as a result situation deteriorated”, stated the President of the USA.
The imported yachts will free from the payment of customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development it is intended to temporarily free the imported yachts and other floating craft for leisure and sport from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes in the enumeration of privilege goods for the temporary free entry were prepared by ministry for the commission of government RF.
On this “to Izvestia” it reported the assistant to the minister of economic development Helen Lashkina.
In June 2015 the Prime Minister of RF Dmitry Medvedev on the sums of the trip to the Crimea directed the number of departments - Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Transportation RF, Minkultury, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergencies, the FSB [Federal Security Service], FTS, to Rosturizmu - to prepare proposals on the creation of favorable conditions for yakhtinga in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the complete absence of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts is major problem.
Owners prefer to store their vessels abroad - approximately €200 of million yearly depart to the treasury of European states for the content, repair and servicing of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia it prepared the project of the Council resolution of Eurasian economic commission “about the introduction of changes in the enumeration of the goods, temporarily imported with the complete conditional release from the payment of customs duties, taxes”, that foresees the assignment of complete conditional release from the payment of customs duties, taxes with respect to the imported yachts and other floating craft for leisure and sport.
In the opinion of the ministry, this will undoubtedly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yakhtinga in the coastal zones of the country, noted Lashkina.
This question was carried out for the examination of subcommittee for customs-tariff, netarifnomu regulation, safeguard measure in foreign trade of government commission for economic development and integration, whose session took place in September, and on the sums of consideration it was also approved by departments.
As it noted the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure for complete conditional release with the import is in its essence privilege.
Therefore after the assertion of minutes of the meeting of subcommittee in the government of the Russian Federation of the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce proposal into the Eurasian economic commission for the consideration with the states - members EAES, explained Lashkina.
Into the enumeration of the imported goods, which completely are freed from the payment of customs duties, taxes, enter the goods, necessary for the rendering of assistance to external economic activity and for international collaboration, for the application in the sphere of science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, for the rendering to international aid and to others among them - official equipment (the personal computers, typewriters), control and measuring equipment, drilling equipment, stage suits and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshop, water skis, racing automobiles, motorcycles, sport flight vehicles, the book, newspaper, periodicals, musical tools and objects for the religious rites.

Problem in the fact that in Russia is extremely heavy with yakhtingom precisely because of the weakly developed infrastructure.
If we look to the south of Italy and France, then there this is the entire constantly developing industry, in which is enabled the large number of people.
However, in Russia actually everything it stands still.
Our coast is uninteresting, the only piece, where it is possible to year-round exploit yachts, this Black sea in the region of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossisk, Anapa.
But large complexity in the fact that in this region the extremely strict rules of the boundary service: in order on the yacht to leave to be missed, it is necessary to design the mass of permissions.
Moreover inside Russia to yacht even nowhere to be filled.
Two days it can go with its fuel, and then arises the problem, where it to take, says director on sales to the company of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
As far as places for storing the yachts are concerned, in Moscow and St. Petersburg now there are special hangars for the yachts to 30 m. also of yacht they send in the storage into Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novices it noted that the buyers of yachts - rich; however, since the beginning of the crisis the demand for the yachts was reduced.

In the prisons they request to create separate blocks for the transgenders.
On the public council with the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN [Federal Penitentiary Service]) on the protection of the rights of those condemned in the number of other questions they will in October 2015 discuss possibility of designing in the colonies of separate blocks for the transgenders and transvestites.
About this “to Izvestia” described the Council member Vladislav Grib.
In his opinion, depending on the total number in Russia of those condemned, not determined with the gender, in the domestic prisons possible to provide separate cameras, blocks or even (if such criminals there will be much) over the long term to create for the transsexuals special colony.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that to define to the departure of the punishment of citizens into such isolated places possibly only after those condemned will pass the appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the criminal is actually person, who identifies himself as the representative of opposite gender.
Vladislav Grib it is confident, that insulating transgenders from others prisoners will ensure safety of those serving sentence.
According to him, the proposed practice successfully acts abroad: in SIZO (Detention Facility) (where those accused are located to the Court decision) separate cameras for the transgenders are provided, while in the penitentiary - special blocks.
Today this is only output with the work with such criminals.
They must be unambiguously insulated, since the presence of transvestites and transgenders in the usual cameras is dangerous for them, these are sufferings for their families and the sea of problems for the colleagues of the FSIN [Federal Penitentiary Service].
Humiliation of trances from the side of sokamernikov are guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on that, how large a city, how many criminals with the indeterminate gender, are necessary to calculate, where to distribute them.
SIZO (Detention Facility) separate are not accurately necessary - only cameras, blocks in the prisons.
Yes, separate colony is possible, if transgenders there will be much.
As fungus explained, in the block 50 or 100 people can be contained, and if the specialized housing will be created in Russia one, then to enter the departure of punishment the concluded transsexuals will be able there from any regions.
_citizen contain in SIZO (Detention Facility) on place commission crime, therefore entering transvestite or transgender from other subject in course consequence and sudebnogo court trial unreal, and here introduce this practice for already condemn in separate colony - yes, - count fungus.
Let us recall, on the eve of the colleagues of law-enforcement agencies they could not solve, into what detention facility - man or female - to determine that detained for the storage of the narcotics of the 24-year-old transsexual of Dmitriy Kozhukov (known by the name Alina Davis), because of what the man with the maidenly appearance was not arrested.
They released it home under the house arrest.
This news widely was discussed in the social networks and media outlet, since there is no mechanism of the content of transgenders in SIZO (Detention Facility) and colonies in Rosii actually as yet.
Russian human rights activist, activist of the LGBT-movement (LGBT - lesbian, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolai Alekseyev supported the idea of the creation of special places for the serving of punishment by transgenders, after noting that is abroad also possible the determination of people in the colony - man or female - depending on their own desire.
Taking into account the atmosphere in the Russian prisons, proposal is correct.
Yes, this is very small percentage, but problem exists, just as a question about the guarantee in the prisons of safety for the homosexuals, says Alekseyev.
Prisons must be safe; therefore separate blocks it would be possible to make into the name of this and for the homosexuals, the more which them in the prisons is more than transgenders.
In this case Alekseyev doubts the fact that in Russia will prove to be many citizens, ready to give out itself for transceksualov for this reason, falling into colony the different from the usual.
Certainly, it is possible to introduce physical examination before to place the people in the colony for the transgenders, but not always everything is unambiguously.
For example, in USA one of the prisoners of Chelsea Menning looked like man, and in the prison he already stated that he wants to replace gender, said Alekseyev.
Man can perceive himself with whom conveniently.
But there are no as yet separate places for the serving of punishment for the transgenders, I doubt, that the colleagues of prison will think seriously about the safety of such people and investigate in the finesse of their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time international expert on questions of reproductive health in Boris Lordkipanidze's territory RF noted that the introduction of the new distribution system of transsexual-criminals in the colony can strongly postpone the beginning of the departure of punishment condemned.
Commission is created - a question of sexology is, psychiatrists conduct prolonged observations, this is not one test, on basis of which is done high-precision conclusion.
Today's opportunities of psychiatry this allow.
Therefore before the change of gender potential patients pass always such examinations - they accurately show, the change of gender with the surgical intervention is the necessary measure, says Lordkipanidze.
However, to me it is complicated to present as this system to introduce with respect to those condemned, indeed on the average to this inspection departs month.
Doctor, as a whole the idea of the creation of separate blocks for the transsexuals supported in spite of the fact that, also doubts the fact that under the current economic conditions will expediently separate means to the building of new accomodations, medical examinations, the transgenders in Russia of one.
To calculate complicatedly, there is no official statistics, but if we consider that homosexuals in Russia of about 5%, then it is possible to say that transgenders it is still less, and those, who have this deviation and still and accomplish crimes, completely insignificant quantity, said Lordkipanidze.
Now on the petition before the administration of colony homosexuals, transgenders so can obtain the separate conditions of the content.
Mikhail Antipov won yuniorskiy world championship on chess.
In Khanty Mansiysk was completed the world championship on chess among yuniorov of up to 20 years.
The tail piece of superiority was issued more than by that intriguing.
Winner was determined only in the last stage, and became them Russian Mikhail Antipov, who knew how to nevertheless overtake a Pole to Jan-Kshishtofa Dudu, who like confidently went to the title.
In girls the Ukrainian chess player of Natalie Buksa celebrated victory.
The world championship on chess, which passed since the beginning of September to Khanty Mansiysk, already to the middle of tournament distance, it seemed, it lost almost entire intrigue, since the representative of Poland Jan-Kshishtof Duda, who gave out a series of four victories (competition they are carried out in Swiss system into 13 stages), confidently took leadership.
Taking into account that Duda was the rating-favorite of superiority, yes even is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, probability that it will miss the obtained detachment, it was very insignificant.
And even when Duda reduced revolutions and allowed Russian to Mikhail Antipov to reduce the delay in all to 0.5 marks, it remained obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
Indeed to Antipov in order to overtake leader, it was necessary without fail to win in the 13th stage.
But even this would not help, win Duda your party.
Plus here this obligation of victory, of course, could affect the game of Russian chess player and lead to the optional errors.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov knew how to avoid them.
It confidently managed Francesco Rambaldi, after which it was forced to wait, when its party completes Duda, which was being encountered with Benjamin Bokom.
Fortunately Polish chess player brought together opposition with the Dutchman a draw for Antipov.
Thus, Antipov and Duda collected an equal quantity of glasses - on 10 of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indices.
But therefore precisely to it the management of the Khanty Mansiysk autonomous area, whose governor Natalie Komarov, traditionally pays considerable attention to the development of chess in the region, entrusted main prize.
But here in the competitions of the girls of the intriguing tail piece it did not happen.
To the leader of tournament - Natalie Bukse (Ukraine) - for the achievement of title sufficient it was not to lose in the last stage, that it successfully made.
Thus, the victory of the Russian woman of Alina Bivol did not allow it to overtake bushing.
Russian sportswoman remained the second with the delay from the champion into 0.5 marks.

Comfortable rate for investkredita - 10-13%.
According to the estimations of experts, the market for the crediting of the small and mid-sized business in January - April of the present year sagged to 40%.
Which, according to your estimations, situation today?
- The beginnings of 2015 the volumes of crediting msb considerably were reduced after the panicky moods of end of 2014.
Reason is intelligible: a sharp increase in the interest rates.
Crediting under 25-30% of annual was not profitable no one.
If previously bank could place all its possible problems subsequently into the increased rate, from the delays to no returns, then now this cannot be made: rate and so beyond the clouds.
For the business the current level of rates on the credits msb is uncomfortable.
For the substantial part of the investment projects the current level is unacceptable from the point of view of their compensability.
The level of rates in 10-13% would allow business to invest into the wide spectrum of projects and to form attractive returns on them.
How, according to your estimations, is satisfied the demand of owners for the credits?
After reduction TsB in the interest rate the situation a little was improved.
Credit resources became more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients began to turn for the credits considerably more thinly.
First of all, business does not understand the prospect for its development and future incomes.
Today the business has one output: it is necessary to learn to work, being oriented toward the current economic position in the country and region.
Necessary more attentively to track the current results, to control cash flow.
At the same time with the presence of the financial resources is worth using the new technologies, which make it possible to modernize equipment, to reduce expenditures for production and power supply.
All this, in the final analysis, it makes possible for company to make production of more competitive and to preserve business even in the unstable economic situation.
What basic tendencies of the market for crediting msb will be strengthened and they will influence its development prior to the end of 2015?
Will change the interest rate?
Forecast on reduction in the average rate will in many respects depend on the policy of central bank, and now regulator demonstrates sequence in a question of reduction in the key rate.
However, a radical drop in the price credits for msb to wait it is not worthwhile.
In the current situation the inflation, which makes the increased interest rate for obtaining the real income necessary is, in the first place, problem.
Furthermore, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even with reduction in the rates TsB.
If we speak about the level of delay, then traditionally the companies of the small and mid-sized business, limited both in the opportunities of completing the cash resources, and in the versions of the correction of economic behavior will undoubtedly be larger risk for the creditors.
I did not begin to expect the essential reduction of the portion of poor credits.
Basic reason - international sanctions and their negative economic impact of the country.
New Mazda CX-5 and street mode.
Specifically, the word of Mazda so is written with Japanese hieroglyphs.
It is beautiful, it is laconic and it is simultaneously sufficiently complicated for those, who became accustomed to the Cyrillic alphabet or Roman alphabet.
So new crossover CX-5 as, however, and any other model of the model: without the pretentiousness it is attractive outside, is technically perfect inside.
Japanese is already simple in view of its “yaponskosti” capably of bringing attachment of the articles of the Country of the Rising Sun to the state of complete enthusiasm.
It is possible to as much as desired adduce argument in favor of the machines from other countries, and man even in principle with these arguments will agree, but entire conversation will be scattered from the final phrase: “But the same Japanese automobile!
So to argue not about which!
Such people, probably, must love not only technology, but also increasingly is other Japanese.
To cite on the move bass, to season the food of wasabi, to collect they are rolled to dress its girl friend is not, not in the kimono, of course, and on the canons of the street Japanese mode: it is dear, it is creative and very unexpectedly.
Perhaps, Japanese school form - only form, which the girls bear with the pleasure and after completion of school.
It possesses the surprising properties: simultaneously and sensual, and planing.
And girl it is older, skirt is shorter.
Major change in the appearance CX-5 - radiator grill with five horizontal lines.
But far more strongly changes the appearance of automobile the new figure of headlights and backing lamps, on which the automobile immediately is learned in the flow of machines.
As before, Mazda CX-5 appears very alluringly.
Silhouette is harmonious, form sensual, but appearance in this case has an attack of strictness.
It is not necessary to call the police.
After the control CX-5, one of the safe in the world, it is possible to experience only stoic Japanese calmness.
Diesel engine with a volume of 2.2 l ensures the high torque over a wide range of speeds.
In this case the consumption of fuel of this motor with the power of 175 l with only 5.9 l. is completed power unit by exceptionally automatic transmission and complete drive.
Black boots, black raincoat, black bag…
In order to add into this means of a little black humor, it is possible to select legginsy printom from the police tape Not Cross.
However, in Mazda they applied the maximum efforts so that after the control CX-5 you would not prove to be at the place of our own road accident.
In order to even more increase comfort, after preserving in this case outstanding controllability, in suspension they reworked the construction of front and rear shock absorbers, and also optimized the form of the bushings of front lower levers.
The system of complete drive is adapted under the Russian conditions.
Noise level from the road and engine at the high speeds is reduced by 13%.
Bathing suit into the flower or strip is so dull as budget sedan.
It is another matter if girl shows off in the bathing suit with the original figure.
For example, from the computer game in the genre of role militant.
Attention to it then it will be reached not less than to new CX-5!
New CX-5 has the improved construction both of front and rear seats, what ensures the optimum reserve of space both for the wide arms and for the long feet - who how possesses.
Even long-legged will for sure estimate that the fact that the supports in the forward section of the central tunnel now soft and do not beat along the ankles in the turns.
The widest collection of the active safety system of Mazda is proposed precisely on CX-5.
In order to recognize potential threat, here are used radars, lasers and cameras.
There is here adaptive illumination, and warning about the gathering from the strip, and monitoring dead zones, and safe braking.
In Mazda CX-5 one of the best baggage carriers in the class.
The convenient, having minimum of protrusions, it contains into itself load by the volume of 561 l. the rear seats they are added in proportion 4:2: 4 in this case each section is supplied with separate extension lever - and increases baggage hold to 1560 l.
The suit of the hero of cartoon in Japan is called “kigurumi”.
Kigurumi-pajamas especially fervidly appears.
In it everything is possible!
Certainly to sleep.
But still - to entertain small children.
Or it is simple to stroll by this little beast along the street…
Indeed this so is healthy, when to eat the opportunity to select - funny clothing, manner of behavior or automobile.
We thank for help in the preparation of material the store of Kawaicat.
Kiev tore atomic union.

The talks with Moscow about the completion led by 2010 to the conclusion of intergovernmental agreement, in 2011-2012 of Rada the appropriate laws were accepted.
Since there were no means in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that it is necessary to build blocks to the credit of Russian side, but means so were not isolated.
After the revolution in Kiev in February 2014 cooling with respect to two countries of in February 2014 and subsequent after this Kiev began to displace relations with Moscow in the atomic branch, after declaring about the failure to collaborate on Khmel'nitskiy AES and on the project of the building in the Ukraine of the plant of nuclear fuel.
By the sole sphere, where the relations were preserved, remained purchases in RF of fuel for acting Ukrainian AES (they ensured about half from the electric energy generation in the country), since by thus far Ukrainian NAEK “energy-atom” to replace Russian deliveries with something.
In the Ukraine thus far finally they did not refuse from the plans of the completion Khmel'nitskiy AES with another contractor: still in 2014 in Kiev they declared about the negotiations from Czech Skoda JS.

Inward for long could not pass either the deputies of Gosudmy, or candidates themselves, or observers, but resonance scandal with the assault of the doors of rayadministratsii was shown in the television broadcasting.
At the sessions of neighborhood commissions all observers and members of commissions with the right of consultative suffrage had the capability to be present.
By them head ended access only if voting ended and district commissions yet did not arrive to pass their bulletins.
This was made for the purpose of averting different provocations.
“Head they then repaired, and at all sessions the interested persons could be present”, it countered the member of Natalie Andryushin's gorizbirkoma.
Communists objected, that in the blocked building of administration more than four hours illegally retained the deputy of the Legislative Assembly of region Ludmila Aristov, apropos of what to the Investigative Committee the statement is directed.
Opposition also was agitated, that in a number of Weeks during Election Day they began to seal up urns at 6-7 A.M., laying out in them bulletins for the early voting.

The gain of FedEx bears the mixed nature, reduction in the forecasts in 2016.
FedEx reported about the uncomforting results of last block, and the giant of the service of delivery decreased the forecast of annual profit because of a drop in the demand for the services of freight traffic and increase in the expenditures in its subdivision of ground-based transportation.
Also company stated that it plans to hire approximately 55 000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time in the past year FedEx reported that it will hire 50 000 temporary assistance for the holidays.
Its actions fell in price approximately by 2.5 percent on the preliminary tradings 45 minutes prior to the discovery of exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. she stated that it plans to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year, which concludes in following May, which to 20 cents is less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts assumed $10.84 according to the survey of FactSet.
Reduction in the forecast is observed in spite of lifting of rates on the average by 4.9 percent, which will come into force on January 4, and the increase in the collections for the ground-based transportation of heavy or dimensional loads, which begins in November.
Company stated that an increase in the gain in comparison with last year because of the spending cuts, increase in the gross income and increase in online-trade as before is planned.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company “worked stably taking into account weak, in comparison with the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
The plans of the hire of labor force on the holidays were declared next day after the statement of competitor, UPS, that they plan to hire additionally 95 000 colleagues, approximately so many, they how much assumed upon the work in the past year.
For the block, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned 692 million dollars, higher 6 percent than by year it is earlier.

Six analysts, interrogated Zacks, assumed 12.23 billion dollars.
FedEx suffered in recent years from the decrease in the sector of urgent international transportation, which led to the absence of an increase in the gross income in its subdivision Exspress-perevozok.
However, the boom of purchases in the Internet sharply improved results in FedEx Ground.
In the last block the gain from the ground-based transportation grew by 29%; however, operating incomes remained whole without the changes because of the increased expenditures for large sendings and samostrakhovanie.
Subdivision Exspress-perevozok obtained more high income because of the higher base rates, whereas in the cargo sector income fell because of an increase in the labor costs.
On the preliminary tradings approximately per hour before the discovery of the exchange of the action of FedEx they fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent - to $150.15.

At the most expected after several years meeting the leaders of the Federal Reserve will conduct two days on this week at the 27-one-foot table from the Honduras mahogany, deciding, it is not time to raise key interest rate for the first time almost in ten years.
In one end of the richly decorated room for the conferences with height into two floors above them it will hang the wall image of the United States.
This map - reminding that the chairman of the Federal Reserve Dzhenet L. Yellen and its colleagues must place the economic interests of the country higher than all others.
The Central Bank obtained dual commission from the congress: to maximally increase employment in the USA and to retain here stable prices.
But the leaders of federal system recognized from the time of great recession that there is the third, unwritten commission: financial stability.
And this third commission can prove to be unknown factor in the almost forecast solution, which they will declare is on Thursday, about that, ready the US economy, to be detached away from the bespretsendentnogo stimulus, ensured by almost zero short term interest rate from the end of 2008.
Even with the fact that the majority of the data show a confident increase in the economy, recent shakings on the world financial markets can hold and so the already careful leaders of federal system from the addition of volatility by raising the base rate on the basis of the Federal Funds - even only to fourth of percent point.
“It is obvious that the labor market and inflation will become the first and most important object of examination”, said Lindsi of M. Pegz, Chief Economist of the broker company of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“However I think that if they searched for reason not to raise rate, the increased uncertainty around the World Market it is sufficient in order to give out to them justification to wait further”, it noted.
There is no consensus about the fact that they will make in the Federal Reserve, which by itself provokes the fluctuations of the financial market.
Approximately half of economists, recently interrogated Bloomberg, they forecast an increase in the interest rate on this week.
The financial markets, however, expect that the federal system from this will be held, with the fact that key indicator shows only approximately 30-percent probability of quick ascent.
This can lead to a drop in the equity market, if federal system raises rate, when those, who are made decisions, they will not soften the impact by promise, that the following increase will be not soon.
On Tuesday Dawe-Jones index rose to 228.89 points, or to 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
Takeoff was provoked by the expectations of the fact that those, who determine strategy of federal system, will leave rate on this week, stated John Lonskya, the Chief Economist of the group of Moody ' s of Capital Markets Research.
“It will be surprise, if federal system increases the rates at this moment of time”, it noted.
If the management of the Federal Reserve then enters, “to them it is necessary far to visit in the assertion of its strategy in order to hold the financial markets in the hands so that they would not panic”.
Other experts objected, that an increase in the rate could quiet the financial markets, since this will remove uncertainty apropos of that how federal system will act.
Only month ago federal system, seems, it was inclined to raise rate to 0.25% in this month, making the first small step in the slow stiffening of the financial conditions that it could confirm the strength of the restoration of the USA.
Yellen declared in spring and at the beginning of summer, that it expects increase in the rate in this year, in spite of the complaints from the side of liberals about the fact that the larger economic progress is necessary.
Although the appearance of new jobs in August was slowed down, an increase in the labor market was stable in this year.
Unemployment was reduced to 5.1% in the past month, what is the lowest index in more than seven years, and almost at that level, which in the federal system is considered full employment.
An increase in the wages shows the signs of acceleration.
And, although the inflation continues to be located lower than the outlined by the Central Bank annual index in 2%, the management of federal system stated that the temporary effect of a sharp drop in the prices of oil became key reason.
The economy “can manage also the higher rates, and it needs them, taking into account the reduction of the labor market,” - noted Ian Sheferdson, the Chief Economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, around the world it began to shake the financial markets at the end of the past month, after China devaluated its currency.
The average index of Dawe-Jones for the actions of industrial companies fell on wholes 16% is relatively of record high value in May, since the investors feared, that retarding Chinese economy can inhibit world increase.
Market partly restored its positions in this month, and Dawe-Jones index now approximately to 10% lower than high May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve the resentment of market additionally complicates the complex calculations of the period of an increase in the interest rate.
“In the absence the information about the fact that would occur on the financial markets and news about the weakness of Chinese economy into the latter several weeks they would begin to turn nuts at this meeting”, stated Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former colleague of the Federal Reserve.
Now, according to its forecasts, they will wait, at least, month in order to obtain more than control over consequences.
“There is a large uncertainty in what consequences for the U.S.Economy can prove to be, but they almost do not have reliable data after last events in China”, said Oliner.
The health of world economy does not enter into the deepest concerns of federal system, and technically it should not be considered with making of these decisions.
But actually the Federal Reserve became world financial authority.
The influence of the Central Bank was in recent years enormous.
One only hint from then chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013. about the fact that the Federal Reserve can “mute” its monetary expansion, it caused the shakings of markets around the world.
In the world, where the markets and economic systems ever more are interwoven with each other, it would be possible to expect that the leaders of the Federal Reserve will not only track the course of events everywhere, but also consult with the representatives of other Central Banks and with the experts so that it is better to understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process - “is faster art, than the science”, noted Zachary Karabell, the leader of Envestnet Inc - company, which is occupied by the global strategies of control of states.
Jeffery Laker, the President of the Federal Reserve bank Richmond, Virginia, noted in this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve there were the cases of excessive reaction for the motions of the financial market, which it is, it seems, they were not connected with the economic principles”.
Laker, member with voting rights of influential federal committee on the open market, that insisted on an increase in the rate, as an example gave the solutions of 1998-99 years.
The financial crisis in Asia led to the fact that the federal system decreased its base rate by 0.75% for three sessions, “disregarding of the limited identified consequences for the increase in the USA”, said Laker.
Year later the leaders of federal system cancelled these decreases.
The Federal Reserve should be put in first place the concern about the stability only in the times of the large crises, such as as the collapse of market in 2008”, said Adam S. Pozen, former member of committee on the establishment of the interest rate in Bank of England.
Last panic closely did not approach this level, he said.
“You, of course, did not want to prove to be in the situation, when you frightens an increase in the rates because the markets survive shaking”, said Pozen, the President of the institute of world economy named Peterson.
Federal reserve act on the previous has dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and, until this changes, I do not think that them should be anticipated the events.

Battle for one of the regional titles on the version of international boxer federation (IBF) in the weight category to 57.15 kg, which passed on Friday, was completed by the victory of Magali by knock-out in the 12th round.
However, Brown arrived in hospital with the craniocerebral injury.
Its state was evaluated as critical, and it was connected to the apparatus of subsistence.
On the professional ring Brown gained 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one battle finished a draw.
In it two children remained.
This already the second case of lethal outcome among the Australian boxers in the recent six months.
In March from the injuries, obtained on the ring, passed away the 23-year student of Breydon Smith.
Now AMA recommends not to be occupied by this form of sport, but it is better, from its point of view, it to generally forbid.
I understand, that this occurs unintentionally, stated the Vice President of organization Stephen Pernis. -
But in that form, in which now there is a boxing, will always occur such situations, when athlete obtains hemorrhage or injury of the brain, which leads either to death or to the heavy damage.
It considers for this reason AMA that we cannot continue to live with this.

He stated about this, coming out at the session pA OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) in Ulan-Bator.

Ponaslazhdalsya by victory the pair-troika of days.
World champion of the track and field sports Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be named triumphal for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul of Sergey SHUBENKOVA.
He succeeded in on its crown distance of 110 meters with the barriers defeating on the command superiority of Europe, establishing several records, and the main thing - becoming world champion, moreover by the first in the history of domestic barrier sprint.
Furthermore, recently athlete won the final stage “diamond league”, after occupying in the general test the third place.
“New Proceedings” requested Shubenkova to share with impressions from the outgoing season.
Sergey, season for you are not yet finished?
Yes, I am going to come out at the world war games, which will take place October in Korea, and I will then already think about leisure.
True, be prepared I will now be house, in Barnaul, and to be the houses - this nevertheless entirely another state.
Increasingly it is easier than each week to hurry about around the world.
You somehow said that autumn - dear season for you.
End of August, the beginning of September - excellent time.
Passions after the main start of season boiled, load no longer presses responsibility.
It is possible to compete into the pleasure, on “rasslabone”.
Plus you know that also vacation entirely soon…
But fatigue exists?
Nevertheless season is special, the mass of positive emotions…
Fatigue toward the end of the season is always accumulated.
And it is not here important that it made more - it won or it lost.
Each competition - this is stress.
Constant overflights, passages - all this is not passed for the organism without leaving a trace.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now emotion in me, of course, on the rise.
Yes that there - I am simply happy!
Up to the moment, when they did finish on the world championship in Beijing, you do return frequently?
It occurs.
Yes even you, journalists, do not give to me about this to forget.
But generally I consider that plokh that athlete, who lives by old victories, twists his successful rounds again and again.
Ponaslazhdalsya with victory the pair-troika of days - it is necessary to move further.
Preparation for this remarkable season strongly did differ from the customary?
I cannot say that there was something such special.
To be prepared we began still in December, but I passed winter competing season.
It was trained first house in Barnaul, then on the collections, then again house.
Everything as usually.
But the problem was posed with the trainer: to attempt to leave to the new level, at which I yet was not.
Practically entire winter time they spent on that in order to place base.
They ran into the heap of crosscountry races, caused the exercises on the general physical preparation, which included thrust, and prised, and to spin we pumped through.
Then they started the barrier preparation, were much occupied by technology.
The fact, as do come out rivals, they did follow?
I always try to do this, good in the epoch of the Internet with this there are no problems whatever.
The winter championship of Europe looked, and there in the barrier sprint entire pedestal engaged the French!
It thought still: it is necessary to make something, to dilute this company.
With each start in this season you added and added as results.
This did give confidence?
In me all last seasons are added according to approximately identical diagram.
No such, what I to run first 13.20, and then - 13.50.
I always untwist my form gradually.
The main thing, what was desirable to make, to run out of 13 seconds.
Entire work was directed, first of all, toward this result.
But paradox in the fact that like you feel, that it is prepared for exploits, but to show its willingness is obtained not always on the competitions.
How this was, for example, at the Olympics in London?
I, if it is honest, that semi-final round (Shubenkov could not be selected into the finale. - “NOT”) it tried to forget immediately.
Finished-that it was very well, actually it could run out of 13 seconds.
Yes even if would repeat its best result for that moment, he would become the bronze prize-winner of games.
But it did not transport.
Your first world championship you do remember?
But as?
In to TEG this was.
I very then wanted to climb up into the finale, there was such maximum program.
And it fell off directly from utretsa, in the preliminary rounds.
Then he understood that to vomit and to rush slomya head - means generally anywhere to not come running.
In two years on the world championship in Moscow already it left into the finale with the better time.
I remember well my sensations before the decisive round: greatly it was desirable already then to win “gold”!
How, developing decent speed, it is possible not to lose even and head, not to be turned off?
But here this and there is the most complex.
It is necessary to be for very accurate, concentrated on the technology in order not to bring down barriers.
It noted that when you are tuned not to the result, but to the process, so it is much easier.
But fun itself, when in you appears sensation, that you run and everything as if by itself is obtained!
The word of honor, it that stands.
Many our athletes of the distant village after the first serious successes strive to move more closely for the capital.
There were never such thoughts?
Houses are nevertheless better.
Yes even I do not represent, where I without my trainer, to whom I am necessary?
It can, and it would be to have well conditions rather better, but I try to be contented by the fact that I have.
C Klevtsovym you long ago together?
From 12 years, since it arrived into the track and field sports.
It is more precise, first I was trained in his wife, who worked with the children, and then already it transmitted me.
I began from the sprint, then into the length he jumped, triple.
Children's sports-meet was - this when they metayut ball, they jump into the length from the place…
The run with the barriers tried in 14, and it was pleased to me.
However, from the first round it came out to carry out the norm of the second adult discharge.
So it remained.
Fear before the barriers there was never?
Somehow immediately it came out with them to agree.
But at technology much was always necessary to work.
There above one acceleration how much it suffered!
But from this routine to anywhere not disappear.
Technology must be sharpened constantly - so that at night me it would be possible to wake, I immediately arose and would break into a run through the barriers.
All, who saw your round in Beijing, assert that this was the very beautiful run.
Thanks.
To me and very it was pleased.
Usually I do not reexamine my rounds, and here it could not be held.
But at effectiveness necessary further to work - there are no limits to perfection.
You do not fear now, that the victory in the year to the Olympic Games will lie on arms heavy load?
As they speak in such cases, I will try to justify expectations.
Once selected this road, it means it must go to the end.
My trainer loves to repeat: if you not slabak, no additional load perceive it must.
And I with it absolutely in this am agreeable.
Flocks of Kushanashvilli
Well not so I am naive so that reaction to the interview, which was happened in Ukraine, would lead me into the consternation.
People are embittered, I understand, by their bread not by kormi - give, toss enemy up.
And although by flag I was not wound, and the same, exactly the same, million of times he spoke here, and the cur no one he directly called, me another reserve.
All my pseudo-friends in an instant, per second somewhere were evaporated.
The pressure, which I undergo, so strong that even I, young fellow seen forms, think that people of henbane ate.
As if it went to itself, it went, and you attacked crowd and well to mutuzit by twigs.
But it is necessary to know me, I not room eagle, me by fist, I from the howitzer to vdaryu, I am old, children, to fear.
Another matter - no support.
I and such a one illusions did not have, but now…
Self-sufficiency was always best in me, so that you vykusite.
But to give passports to such freaks as Fred Derst or Monson, can only idiots.
It is better than b to me, to the best journalist, work nestydnuyu.
Week ago in Kiev the flocks of Kushanashvili in the sharp form it described the Crimean events:
That that they completed with the Crimean peninsula - crime.
Specifically, similar they call annexation.
I so assume that the reference to that, as slightly intoxicated Khrushchev something attempted to sign, not in which time is entered in the common picture of human hostel.
This as to arrive at the neighbor and to take its living space away…
War from the Kremlin went, and it will end only there.
I am practically to 100% confident, that, as in summer 2008-go, she began from the bell of any cur from the torture chamber of the Kremlin.
I have assumptions, who this could be…
To Kobzon not too and much to live remained.
I do not understand, it the greatest artist, why it should lick the hands of Putin.
It that, apartment will lose?
Well, they laid to it monument.
Certainly, people indeed memorized it as insulting their home town.
But reconciliation now only on Vladimir Vladimirovich depends.

One of the conditions - housing must be not more expensive than 30,000 rubles for one square meter, into this cost enters the finishing “turnkey”.
If we manage the given ones by volumes, then let us continue participation in the program.
Concerning investors, there are other interesting projects.

The surgery of obesity can help diabetics with small obesity
Favorable effect after the surgery of obesity in people with small obesity, of the suffering a diabetes 2 types, can last not less than five years, according to a new study.
However, now it is thus far still early to assert that the diabetics with small obesity live longer after the surgery of obesity than those, who obtain nonsurgical treatment.
“The statistics of mortality is manifested in no way immediately”, stated doctor Robin Blekstoun, expert on surgery of obesity, written about a new study in the column of editor JAMA Surgery.
The surgery of obesity, or bariatricheskaya surgery, uses different methods for the decrease of size of stomach.
They decrease a feeling of hunger and limit the ability to organizam to master food.
After several years bariatricheskaya surgery proved its effectiveness for treating 2 types diabetes, but basic studies were conducted among the people with morbidnym obesity, which have the index of the mass of body (IMT) 35 or above.
IMT, the measure of weight relative to increase, is considered normal with the value from 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above speaks, that in man excess weight, and people IMT higher than 30 consider themselves by people with obesity.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study the researchers from the Taiwan hospital of Min-Sheng of General used the data, assembled since 2007, for the comparison of two types of bariatricheskoy surgery - the shunting of stomach and sleeve gastrectomy, with the medical treatment of 2 types diabetes in people with small obesity.
Average value IMT in those, who underwent surgical intervention, fell from 31 to 24.5 toward the end of the fifth year of their participation in a study.
At the same time IMT in those, who obtained nonsurgical treatment from the diabetes, remains approximately at level 29.
Among those, who transferred operation, completely they cured from diabetes 36%, and partially - 28%.
In the group, which obtained drug treatment, for the comparison, complete recovery from the diabetes was observed only in 1%, and partial - only approximately in 2%.
Furthermore, the indices of blood pressure, triglycerides and “poor” LPNP of cholesterol “as a whole were better in the surgical group”, declare the authors.
Researchers also controlled the levels of hemoglobin of A1s in the blood, which reflect the levels of sugar in the blood in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin of A1c is better to retain lower than 7%, write researchers.
After surgical intervention the average level of hemoglobin of A1c was reduced approximately from 9% to approximately 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, approximately at level 8%.
But the best indices of glycemic control, reflected by good levels of hemoglobin of A1c, did not reduce the level of mortality after five years according to the leader of studies of Dr. Chi-Cheng by sous and by colleagues.
Research group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
By the fifth year, in the comparison with the group, polchivshey sleeve gastrectomy, the group of shunting lost more than weight (18.7 kg against 14.2 kg), it attained a larger decrease IMT (to 7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin of A1s (3.1% against 2.1%), and it was also nearer to the complete remission of diabetes (46.9% against 16.7%).
Although a new study does not demonstrate the advantages of surgical method in the part of the lifetime after five years, there is confirmation according to the results of investigating the people with the excess mass of body in Sweden, that the surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in the lifetime, as reports Blekstoun from the college of medicine in g. of Finiks, university of Arizona.
According to the data of Swedish of study for the people with obesity, which selected bariatricheskoe interference, the probability to die for a period of 15 years was approximately to 29% below in comparison with the group, in which adapted more traditional methods.
In spite of the fact that a new study did not show an increase in the lifetime, Blekstoun it noted that this encourages people with IMT lower than 35, interested in this procedure.
“Here report is very important, since in it is asserted that such surgical intervention is safe in the group with low IMT, where is absent the increased risk of mortality or nephritic diseases”, she stated.
Blekstoun added that people and their doctors must begin seriously to relate to the weight, as soon as IMT of patient falls into the range between from 27 to 30.
“I count, we too for long wait in order to force people to relate to this seriously”, she said.
It seems me that as soon as they will accumulate the genetic mutations, which start in their bodies obesity and diabetes, to turn this is backwards very difficult.
In Mytishchi the robbers carried out from the house of fur coat and 9 million rubles.
In Mytishchi the robbers attacked the inhabitants of near-Moscow house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's fur coats in them.
On this it informs “Interfax” with the reference to the press service MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) RF.
Incident occurred Tuesday morning.
Two unknowns through the open entrance door entered into the house, located on the street of Gor'kiy, they connected the 20-year son of the owner of house and, threatening with both knives, they stole 9 million rubles and three fur coats.
According to the preliminary data, the sum of damage was 9,265,000 rubles, is excited criminal case for the article “robbery”.
Fans from Europe risk to become homeless.
Only 23 Petersburg hotels have the right to place the tourists, who in 2018 will arrive to look the World Cup in themselves.
Remaining hotels thus far do not hurry to obtain the appropriate permission.
In the opinion of the experts, this is very alarming sign.
On the threshold of the world superiority for authorities urgently it is necessary to devise as to settle all guests of city.
The collocutors “of RosBalt” consider that because of the tournament cost the lease of detachable apartments will grow by 10-30%, moreover and it is necessary to overpay after championship for detachable housing.
The World Cup forced authorities to focus attention on the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specially under the superiority, each hotel of Petersburg must pass the procedure of classification and prove that it corresponds to the declared quantity of stars and to level of service.
It is even now understandable that it will be possible to make this not all: otelery so fear the checkings that often even do not send the documents to the requests of federal antitrust service on Petersburg.
As described head UFAS Vadim Vladimirov, department studied 138 hotels and now it plans to bring 34 matters with respect to the hotels, many of which simply did not answer by anti-monopolecabbage soupKAM.
There are signs, that the management of three ten companies deceived townspeople, placing one or another quantity of stars in the advertisement, Vladimirov noted.
Problem in the fact that now literally each number, one cannot be lost before 2018 on the calculation.
Officials suspect, that during the football championship the fans will engage all Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city tourists can design for 30,500 numbers.
According to the data of Smolnyy, in Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-starconfrontation hotel, 100 - two- and three-starconfrontation, 550 - odnozvezdochnykh.
According to the first deputy of committee on the development of tourism are Gvichii, at the given moment only 23 hotels passed classification - so many checkings companies the accredited in Petersburg were conducted.
But did here order any hotel a similar procedure in regional enterprises, to Smolnyy as a result of the surprising confluence of circumstances it is unknown.
I.e., passed classification it can be and more, but no one about this knows.
“Last half a year hotels greatly did not attempt to pass classification”, recognized the director of the North Western department of the Russian union of turindustrii Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is explained by the high season, during which otelery earn most of all money and do not want to be occupied by other matters.
One additional reason - budgets, in which were not laid the expenditures for checkings, in this case procedure can manage to hotel depending on status from 30 to 100,000 rubles and more.
But nevertheless recently the leaders of hotels were activated and they began to give claims to the classification, certified Shadskaya.
To hotels necessary to have time until July 1, 2016, otherwise they not only will pay penalty, but still and will not be obtained the right to work on the world championship.
It is already known that depending on zvezdnosti will be developed the fixed pay for the number in the hotel to the period of conducting tournament.
The formulas, according to which will be calculated the cost, will promulgate in the following year.
This is done in order not to allow the takeoff of prices of 200-300%, as this occurs, for example, during the Petersburg economic forum.
It is necessary to have a conscience and not to allow increase two or three times, but also for hotels it is necessary to give to earn.
“I think, increase will be to 50%”, explained the President of Russian hotel association Gennadiy Lamshin.
In turn Vadim Vladimirov it is not confident, that the fixation of prices corresponds to understanding market economy.
I do not know, how this is plotted in the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
“This is better than the unrestrained cost-increase”, it noted.
It is unclear, which will be with popular cheap khostelami.
Deputies of the Gosduma introduced the bill, according to which khostely must be forbidden in the apartment houses.
Greatly we hope that this law will not be accepted or will not concern Petersburg.
“We will defend the point of view, that khostely must be preserved”, it counts Gvachiya.
However, according to her, the owners of mini--hotels in any event must be ready to the stiffening of housing code.
If the State Duma nevertheless approves bill, then in Petersburg it will be shut approximately by 80% of khostelov, and 1,500 numbers are counted at the given moment in them.
, In Petersburg two- and three-starconfrontation hotels are not sufficient according to the President of the federation of restaurateurs and otelerov of Leonid Garbar's northwest, which exactly are claimed by football fans, then there is a misalignment to the side of hotels with four and five stars.
This position of the matters is analogously to the situation, when “on the 80-thousandth stadium sit 75,000 vipov”.
This can be corrected exactly due to the mini--hotels.
Their possible prohibition expert considers “idiocy”: “To me it seems strange that some people can live in the apartments, but here visitors for some reason cannot.”
If khostel is used as hostel, then I am agreeable, that this is incorrect.
But if as the hotel, into which the guests do arrive for the short time, then why no?
Mini--hotels risk to pass the World Cup and because of their nerastoropnosti.
Wholes of hundreds of small hotels simply will not have time to pass classification, moreover pit dig to themselves.
To the summer of 2016 order works there will be all hotels of city.
“The companies, which can conduct this procedure not so much; therefore they will reject the less paid orders from mini--hotels, but they will select those, which more expensive”, noted Gennadiy Lamshin, after adding that in a number of cities, for example, to Moscow and Volgograd, the indices of the passed checkings at the given moment considerably higher than Petersburg.
The reason for Petersburg delay is connected including with constant transpositions in the tourist block of government, that it does not contribute to the well-coordinated work.
In the opinion of the experts, if Petersburg hotels by all are not sufficient, which most likely it is necessary to turn attention to the provincial hotels and recreation centers.
On an example of the celebration of the 300-anniversary of Petersburg into the city they can mobilize river fleet, i.e., the guests of tournament can live in the cabins.
Moreover many fans podgotovlenno will arrive on the vans, in which it will be possible to pass the night.
“The main thing not to dispose so many hotels so that then they would be empty”, it were confident Gennadiy Lamshin.
Also by large popularity during the football superiority will use detachable housing.
Most probably in the city they will create the reserve of detachable apartments.
Rates on the lease will grow by 10-30%.
“From the obvious - first will leave housing near the stadium”, it noted specialist in the lease of the agency of a development and studies in Larissa Bragin's real estate.
The price of lease can not return to the previous level after championship, especially in the sleeping regions.
To this will contribute the building of new transport junctions in the outskirts of city, she emphasized.
It is not worth forgetting, also, about the human qualities of townspeople.
For example, Leonid Garbar it is confident, that Petersburg was always the hospitable city, in which the people do not simply prompt road, but they can still and conduct mini--excursion.
There are complications.
My dad to year in the 1970's in the court met family from Murmansk - father, mother and two children.
It it proved to be nowhere to pass the night: it was then complicatedly, on the train station sleep heavily with the hotels.
“Dad brought them into our communal flat to sleep”, recalled collocutor.
True, it added that now this feature in the inhabitants of city it did not remain - to call to itself home fraught with consequences it is terrible.
But can, in 2018 after the unsuccessful solutions of the State Duma, errors of otelerov and governments it is necessary to recall byloe?
Zhirinovsky " poured off” Amur region.
With the admiration today it looked at Zhirinovsky's clownery in the State Duma.
It made such things, when our generation only learned to deal in newspapers, and, until now it is located in the excellent form.
Theme of the appearance, like, “the protest of the LDPR (Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia) against the election results in Amur region”.
By protocols it does not shake - since by something; other protocols, except those signed by election committees, the LDPR (Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia), judging by everything, does not have any.
Here it raises engaged the second place of Ivan Abramov and shouts something like: “Here is - winner of elections!”
And here not from what it attacks Rodninu, and then, after skirmish already with that presiding, takes away fraction from the chamber, vopya literally “you everything with the fronts by your cheats and thieves”.
Press, naturally, gives emphasis not on Abramov, but on scandal and demarche of fraction as the consequence of this scandal and insult.
Actually Volfovich beautifully and elegantly poured off Amur region together with Abramov.
For the entire country these are - the next trick of Zhirinovsky in the style “scum! ”, but completely not the protest of political party against the results of concrete elections.
Both the fraction it is formal of poskandalila and elections, if we believe to the site of party and to Feysbuku of Ivan Abramov, they are not acknowledged, but leader from the theme obviously descends.
It lets dead in Amur itself bury their corpses, and itself blagovestvuet against “United Russia” as a whole and in nothing by not guilty Rodninoy.
Elegant solution in order and face not to lose, and into the present, and not showy scandal not to go.
It is another matter that now in the strange position occurs and itself Abramov.
Besides howls from the authorities it waited for nothing, there are no protocols of alternative on the hands.
It - the out of focus of public attention, from one side, but with another - for the small circle precisely it became formal occasion also for the insult of the respected champion, and, which is still steeper, caddish attacks United Russia and ONF [All-Russia People's Front].
And here to it is, of course, necessary to seriously greatly think what to make.
Because from the main beneficiary of elections, policy the number of 2 regions and candidates number 1 to the only provincial single mandate region it can become the pariah, by whom successfully popolzovalos its own party leadership also of super-stimulus for that ONF [All-Russia People's Front] itself and party leadership of stranger.
It is here already accurately - there would be no Zhirinovsky, him was to be devised and it respectfully observed.
To Tramp to it still grow and grow.
The news appeared, that the LDPR (Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia) will return to the hall during following plenarki.
I.e., bath fell generally not from what.
It is singular, under itself it buried Abramov's theme.
It is beautifully actually.
“This is impossible that everyone would arrive to Europe” - dalai-lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, stated dalai-lama, after adding, that the real decision of the current crisis of refugees lies on the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists issued a call to end violence in the countries, which are the native land of refugees.
Dalai-lama touched a question of the continuous crisis of refugees in his speech during the discovery of the center of compassion Dalai lama in Oxford, the dedicated to studies ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He stated that in the existing circumstances the interests of humanity they must be higher than the interests of the individual countries or even continents.
He also emphasized that, although this causes admiration, the reaction of the West European countries to the crisis of refugees is not adequate situation.
“This neozmozhno so that all would arrive to Europe”, it noted in its speech.
Although the dalai-lama highly answered about those undertaken by Germany and by Austria actions in connection with the crisis, he emphasized that this only temporary solution.
“The concern about thousands of refugees - it is wonderful, but simultaneously you must think also about the durable solutions how bring the real world and present development, mainly through the formation, into these Muslim countries”, he emphasized.
Finally, we must think about how reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force never solved these problems”, it added.
Speaking about the violence, dalai-lama also commented on the actions of George Bush after terrorist attacks 9/11, after stating that the rigid reaction of the USA launched the chain of the uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed my condolences in the letter to President Bush and said to it that the solution of this problem is possible through the nonviolence.
I know that his intentions were good, but it used force, and this caused the unexpected consequences”, said dalai-lama.
Fourfold increase in the quantity of children, who swallowed the disinfecting means for the hands, in last 4 years
Toxicological centers in the United States reported a almost 400-percent increase, since 2010, quantity of children younger than 12 years, which swallowed the disinfecting means for the hands with the high content of alcohol, as reports the toxicological center of the state of Georgia.
According to doctor Geylord of Lopez, director of the toxicological center of the state of Georgia, the cases of swallowing by children of up to 12 years of liquids for the disinfection of the hands, about which it communicated to the toxicological centers, it grew from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children contact with these substances more frequently, and, unfortunately, their certain percentage leaves for the department of ambulance”, described Lopez to CNN.
It described that some children drink the disinfecting liquid specially, and some make this in order to produce impression on its friends, or on the dispute for the social networks.
Evidently on the videotapes on Youtube, as adolescents they drink the disinfecting liquid as the cheap drinking bout.
As it communicates, adolescents mixed up the disinfecting liquid with the alcohol-containing liquid for the gargling of mouth in order to obtain stronger beverage.
The children of younger age they can draw the pleasant smells of the disinfecting liquid.
“Child does not think that this can to him do harm”, reported Lopez.
Many of most that attracting (disinfecting liquids for the hands) - those, which are aromatized.
Are the disinfecting liquids for the hands with the smell the strawberries, grapes, orange, which are very attractive for the children.
The disinfecting liquid for the hands contains somewhere from 45 to 95 percent of alcohol.
In the small children, in particular, a total of several dispersions can cause alcoholic poisoning.
“This is alcohol of high concentration”, described Fox 4 in Kansas City Dr. Stephen Tornton, head physician of toxicological center in the hospital of the Kanzasskogo university.
You would not leave simply so wineglass with the whisky, but people hold in sight these disinfecting means for the hands, and if children them reach, this is the rapid method to use the large number of alcohol.
Naidzha Russell, six-year-old girl, who in the school recently swallowed the disinfecting means for the hands with the strawberry aroma in the number of approximately four dispersions, was sent for the treatment for the department of ambulance.
The level of alcohol in the blood in it was 179, two times it is more than in adult, which is according to the law considered being been in a state of the alcoholic intoxication according to Dr. Chris Ritchie - the doctor of ambulance, who treated it in the medical center of Gwinnett not far from Atlanta.
Naidzha confused words and could not walk, when they delivered it into the department of ambulance.
Doctors observed entire its night in the separate children's clinic in order not to pass any signs of cerebral injury, since because of alcohol the girl fell and was struck by head, described Ritchie.
“This was very terribly”, described CNN Ortoriya Scott, mother of Naidzhi.
This completely could prove to be fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers to use nespirtovye substances or disinfecting napkins, moreover, chtby to remove the disinfecting liquids for the hands from the zone of the reach of children.
Besides the alcoholic poisoning, some disinfecting liquids connect with deaths.
In 2013 two women from Ontario died after they swallowed the disinfecting means, which contained the toxic nezayavlennyy ingredient.
The officials of public health suspect, what product contained methanol - fatal agent, but not ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as the acting substance.
In January three students-chetveroklassnika on the north of New York arranged for to poison their “contrary” teacher via “the propagation of antibacterial substances in the class”, according to the report to the police.
In teacher strong allergy on disinfectors for the hands, and it forbade to hold them in its class.
The police considers that the unsuccessful plan was “empty conversations”, and it addresses questions of discipline to school region.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul it became family club.
Cast iron owl is sad on the back of bench at the entrance into the boundary children's library named N.K. Krupskiy.
Little-ones, who come after the books, attempt to feed by its candies.
Already several generations walk into this library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twentieth years of past century arranged here loud readings, placed plays on Mayakovskiy's verses, carried out literary quizzes and they were copied with the wife of Lenin.
Correspondence continued four years, and, as wrote in 1939 the newspaper “young stalinets”, became increasingly more strongly with each day “the friendship between the hope of Konstantinovna Krupskiy and friends of the children's library of Barnaul city”.
Hope Konstantinovna even sent to once distant Barnaul friends its children's photograph.
But when barnaultsy asked, does not object hope Konstantinovna, so that they would appropriate its name to the library, it wrote that no, it does not object.
Letters have long ago been raised dust in the museum, and to grandsons and for the great-grandsons of the first readers it is necessary to explain, whose this severe profile decorates bas relief on the building of library.
Different people frequently rang in the years of reconstruction, they were agitated: why children's library is not re-named?
Let be the library the name of any good children's writer, without the political painting!
The colleagues of library settle, they thought, and they decided to leave everything, as there is.
“Krupskiy” - this, perhaps, the most known and dear library in Barnaul as “leninka” in Moscow.
On the gender in the library vestibule - path from the yellow brick.
“The magician of emerald city” - the dear theme of artist Oli to Moskovki.
Earlier than Olya he was manager in the juridical company, it came to the work into eight, it departed to five, and from all remaining managers it differed only in terms of love for the drawing.
But then found in the Internet the declaration: “Is required illustrator for the book”.
Book wrote small American girl, and she was called “My Cancer Mommy” - “in my mom cancer”.
Olya made illustration, and she thought: life can end at any moment, and no miracles in it will be, if you do not create their itself.
Now it works in the library, it illustrates the children's books of the writers of entire world itself writes fairy tales.
It is traditionally considered that the children lose interest in the book, that they increasingly more live in some virtual space…
But to us-that walk the reading children, and their parents understand the value of reading, tells “Russian planet” the director of library Tatiana Kushvid.
In recent years even this moment of confidence arose, that the children's library was necessary, and it will be live - children-that they go here!
It seems me, interest in reading returns.
In the vestibule of library large exhibition stained-glass panel with the renewable photo-exposure hangs.
Once in the block are weighed the new photographs of the readers, who walk into the library by the entire family: mom, dad and children.
In the library they are glad, that with the children increasingly more frequently began to come dads.
If in two years to child they read entire Chukovskogo, then at more the elder age to it were necessary the books a little more complicated.
But now acts the law, according to which to eight-year-old child prodigy it is forbidden to issue books from category 12+.
In order to obtain this book, child must bring with himself parents - they come, they then return again, and gradually “Krupskiy” becomes for them something like the family club.
In the library is treasures - pre-revolutionary collection of bylinas with yatyami and erami, to bring Korolenko in the appendix to the journal “field”, the hemming “of Murzilki” in 1936.
Indeed we now not only conceptual space “the temple of the book”, we are now opened for the motion, we try to become the special place: not by house, not by work, not by school, explains Tatiana Kushvid.
At us it is possible to arrive in order by all to together read a little, to play a little, to porisovat.
We made a play zone for the little-ones - child comes simply to play a little, and hand-that nevertheless is pulled to the book!
Parents take away some our readers, and they rest by legs, they do not want to depart.
Moms with the carriages frequently come - and to us it is pleasant that they put in first place library among all remaining places, where it is necessary to come with the little-ones.
Tatiana Kushvid speaks: contemporary children just as we once, love the classical children's literature:
“The publishing matter now is developed, and much attention is given to the authors, who are the connecting link between the generations”.
But if we speak about small detkakh, then by them it is important so that there would be some hero, who travels of one book into another.
Children do not love to part from their heroes.
Library constantly publishes booklets for the parents, in whom he says, which occurs in the contemporary children's literature, to what books it is worthwhile to focus attention and why.
Booklets are so captivating and are intrigued intrigue that also adult interest, but this library nevertheless not for them.
To carry the books beyond the limits of reading hall adult is forbidden.
This magic privilege exists only in children.
… In most distant room of library there is a square hatchway with the ancient wooden stairs into the basement, in the library.
Steps will poskripyvat under your steps - this is the already very old machine of time.
With the book of your childhood you are encountered as with the old comrade: regards, it is good that we with you do not change.
Of Elli everything so gaily steps along the road, paved by yellow brick, the lazy person of the roofing of saffron milk-caps steals magic matches, but Malchish-Kibalchish so did not say to cursed burzhuinam of military secret - this already in it solid word.
Such books - as passwords, on them in any place it is possible to learn its.
There is into the depository and present book rarities - for example, the pre-revolutionary the collection of bylinas with yatyami and erami.
Or to bring Korolenko in the famous appendix to the journal “field”.
Or the hemming “of Murzilki” in 1936.
Time aged pages, painted them into the tea colored.
These publications no longer issue to the readers.
These are the splinters of our future collection, I all dream - I will leave to the pension and will study rare children's books.
But children to this already, so to speak, will not be brought: and paint in the old books not very bright, and theme… you open the first page, but there - Lenin, party, komsomol.
Now it seems: why we everyone extracted this “pioneer truth?”
But it was nevertheless interesting, it tells “Russian planet” of Galina Ilyasova, who manages by library.
The pages “of Murzilki” darkened from the time.
Galina Vasilevna manages library entire her life.
She knows, what color cap in Buratino, in what academic year Harry Potter became the captain of the command of Griffindora on the championship on kviddichu, in what situations Karlson uses a muffler for the little motor, and as whom works the father of Alisa Seleznevoy.
For the work of librarian pay little, and all, who can live without these book numbers, very rapidly finds to itself another profession.
Only most convinced remain: enlighteners, teachers, the servants of the cult of the book.
It is possible to learn them also on the smile - it is considered that this is the professional feature of children's librarian.
If it smiled to you into the first minute of conversation - this is professional.
I generally love the children's books: as to librarian me it pleases so that they would be so that exactly and beautifully they would stand on the regiments, and still I adore to read them, says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical narratives, fairy tale, fantasy.
I read the contemporary Russian authors, fresh transfers…
Certainly, it seems me, in my childhood everything was other.
The books were most interesting and which grip from in all, which then occurred with me.
And since I madly loved them, me it seemed that library - this magic place.
And me it was desirable to work, where all sit and read.
I hope that the books will be always, in spite of the readers.
And I am glad, when our former readers bring children, and that grandsons…
Mill of the rumors: In “Seltike” there are no differences
Griffiths refuted conversations about the differences in “Seltike” after the acknowledgement of Deyly, that “Hoopes” in the poor position, but he this will repair.
“Kharts” will protest against the claim of Scottish football association against Neilson, and Uorberton fears the signing of the contracts in January, which can destroy the unity of the command
“Dons” increased advantage over “Seltik” to five points
Adam Rooney's penalty in first time gave “to Aberdeen” small advantage above “Hamilton” in Pittodri, that made it possible “Dons” to be detached away from “Seltika” to five points.
Griffiths refuted conversations about the differences
This caused rumors about the differences in “Seltike”, which were suppressed by Griffiths, who stated that it and his comrades upon command suffer not from what strengthened criticism, being prepared for the meeting with the leaders of Dutch league.
I do not consider that we perceive stress, I consider that the players for it strive.
To the Dutch it is boring, because there are no Scotsmen in the fight for the title - de Boer
The former half-back from “the Rangers” and the former member of the team of the Netherlands de Boer's Ronald stated that the Dutch football fans lost interest in “Seltiku”, since it does not compete for the title s “the Rangers”.
De Boer, at present - the representative “of Ajax”, he said: ” In Holland no longer show the most attractive moments of the games “of Seltika”, but why?”
This because no “the Rangers”.
People here speak not only about the return “the Rangers”.
They speak about “old firm”.
They speak about both commands together, and that which interests them.
In the games “old firm” much stress, and not only the people in Scotland want to see these games.
“I everything will change”, stated Deyla
Ronnie Deyla recognized that “Seltik” experiences difficulties, but Norwegian trainer was vowed to change everything.
After the defeat from “malm” and, as a result, output from the League of Champions soon followed the loss 10 football players “of Aberdeen”, which now, after being detached to five points, occupies the upper line of table.
However, Deyla it stated: ““Selitka” had poor periods and earlier, and we will leave again”.
Now we want to leave this as fast as possible.
I understand, that this is very annoying, and numerous people very, it is very evil or detuned by the fact that it occurs.
And we also, but we should continue.
And we actually, actually need the support “of Seltika”, because players become much better from this.
To remain together now so is important.
Uorberton with the distrust waits the January transfers
In spite of the opinions, which were appeared in all the pair of weeks ago, that assume that it determined some of the purposes of January transfers, the boss “of Rangers” Mark Uorberton with the distrust relates to the January campaign, asserting that he does not want to destroy the unity of command.
Former attacking “Brentforda” it stated: “January transfer window greatly differs from summer window”.
Concerning the players, who come in summer, you have a period prior to the beginning of season for their adaptation, that you saw in our own group in this season.
Command works actually well.
Sometimes more than harm is brought by the addition of the unnecessary players to those, who are actually necessary to you.
To Michu, in which is interested “Seltik”, it hinted about the completion of the career
That attacking “of Suonsi” Michu, connected s “Seltikom” during the transfer window, hinted, that it can leave football after it will end its contract with “Cygnus”.
29-year-old player suffered from the problems with the ankle for two years, and could not leave Wales this summer.
“Kharts” are assembled to resist SFA apropos of the statements of Neilson
“Kharts” conducted with the score 2:1, when they removed Patterson, and they began to lose 3:2; however, they more lately cancelled the red card of defender; this is the third red card of Kolluma, annulled in eight months.
Neilson does not reject his words, asserting: “I did not subject to doubt ethics, I did not comment on game”.
Griffiths was vowed to avoid Taynkasl
The obstinate player of the command “of Khaybernian” obtained pronunciation after it recognized that sang song with the insulting words about the former player “of Kharts” ore down Skatsela.
Incident occurred in the pub in Rouzbern region in Edinburgh before beginning Edinburgh derby on Taynkasle in March 2014.
“This was derby, and this was rashly, stated that attacking, after adding: “I can with the confidence say that I did not intend to return to Taynkasl, if he does not play for “Seltik”.
Donnelli: the council of Tannadis it is confident in the management “Dundee United”
Simon Donnelli asserts that the board of directors “to Dundee United” it is as before confident, that the command of managers will change position to the best; however, it agrees that worsening in the situation in the field must end.
I think, Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare children to leave again”, it said Donnelli.
Makinnes is glad, that “not-pretty” it won in “Khemiltona”
Derek Makinness recognized that for his command “Aberdeen” it was necessary to desperately battle against “Khemilton Assis” in order to attain the seventh victory in a row in the superiority of league, which placed them on five points above “Seltika”, above tournament table, because of Adam Rooney's penalty in first time.
Poppy-Inness said: “There is no here such command, which anything won - goblet, or the championship of league, who did not win meeting similarly”.

In these 12 months we saw further improvement in the situation on the market for labor of Scotland with an increase in employment and decrease of unemployment.
Why I - the witness of execution in Oklahoma
Today, deviating from juridical interference in the late stage, I will look, as they execute man.
If this happens, and I hope that nevertheless no, I will sit on the inspection gallery of death row in the prison of the state of Oklahoma, when Richard Glossip is executed with the aid of the fatal injection.
It requested me to be one of four official witnesses of its death.
For the first time this request was made still in January, through its close friend, and, although I was they will throw down into the shock, I agreed.
With the approximation I began to fear this day.
So why this to make?
I agreed, since he thought that this is a good method to describe the detailed history of capital punishment.
This would propose unique foreshortening.
Yes, journalists it is permitted to be present on the executions in America, and, since desiring frequently it is more than places, the results of gloomy lottery decide, who will be selected.
In Oklahoma they reduced number of packages for the press from 12 to five.
Whoever was selected, he will look at this without the emotions.
I cannot make this.
I will sit with the very close friends of Richard Glossip, and with it arose their own relations after several months of phone calls and one visit, which was being lasted two and one-half of hour.
This fellow pleases me.
We frequently laugh, when we talk with it.
The administration of prison asserts that I cannot be simultaneously witness and journalist; therefore me they will not permit to take notebook and arm in order to write down that the fact that I see.
For me it is necessary to try to memorize all details.
One woman journalist of Oklahoma accused me of Twitter in the fact that I enter by my impartiality.
This is lesson.
Describe the history of prisoner in the manner that it pleases it, obtain access.
I complained by it.
It recognized that itself “would can and rather better to formulate”, but it as before considers that I am unjust in the fact that I make.
Richard Glossip did not agree koe with which from the fact that I said and wrote.
He did not tell me that to write, and I would not begin this to make, even if he spoke.
I said to it that he can cross me out from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants so that the journalist of international publication would be present there in order to write about this.
If it dies, it considers that glasnost will help movement for the cancellation of capital punishment.
Kim Bellver, reporter from “Khaffington post”, will be together with me.
If you want to learn more about this matter, listen to podkasty, which I wrote down.
I not to camp to go here in the detail again.
I cannot say with the confidence that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
Its actions after Barry van Treeze's murder make him guilty of the complicity to crime.
But I believe that there is great probability that it is not guilty of the murder.
I am solidly confident, which evidence for the death sentence was insufficient.
I consider that his execution is erroneous.
And I will look from this foreshortening, as he will die.
I cannot state that I will be wholly objective.
There will be other reporters, to which it is possible for this to turn.
You learn from me, is how this - to look as man, who pleases me, it dies without the need.
The pursued by the police person they persuaded to vylezti from the river Canning
For Constable from the town Canning-Veyl it was possible to persuade man to vylezti from the river Canning, and very to remain dry.
The inhabitant of Perthes intended to leave from the police, but he did not know how, after getting stuck in the dirty water in the shoal in several meters from the officer of the police, who attempts “to softly persuade him to leave on the shore”.
The police Canning-Veyla was caused on Tuesday on the fact of illegal penetration to the strange territory in Buckingham.
When policemen noted that suspected, it attempted to leave from them, after rushing in Canning.
But far it did not swim away.
“It stood in the water and spoke “I will not leave, give, be sufficient me”, described Senior Sergeant Shandell Kasldayn.
To Constable to Lachlan Perkhavetsu it was not greatly desirable to moisten form; therefore he used a safer method - “negotiations with good policeman”.
“Sometimes people make strange things in order to attempt to run out”, says Senior Sergeant Kasldayn.
Football player-champion Ben Kazins precisely by this was memorized.
In 2006 Kazins moved out in cuvettes in order to avoid meeting with the police patrol for the checking to alcohol, and Swan attempted to swim across.
Its efforts proved to be useless, but spodvigli of local residents to invent the comic “biathlon of Ben Kazins”.
Peter mudi charges stewards in an attempt at espionage and threatens to leave from the horse sport
Peter mudi accused the stewards of Racing Victoria in an attempt at to inject spy in his stable in the past year and it threatened, which will immediately leave horse sport.
Its target became stewards and colleagues of the division of the ethics of Racing Victoria, which it accused of the fact that they organized campaign personally against it, and removal from lady Tatai's start because of the disturbance of the rules of the application of medicines during the day of start, on Wednesday, it became last straw.
Mudi reported Fairfax Media that it always applies all efforts, participating in the jumps, and it proved to be in the difficult situation, when the discussion turned to the positive result of the test of Lidari for cobalt, it cannot explain what.
It held language apropos of the suspicions of espionage for a period of one-and-a-half years and did not want this “to look like it was green grapes”.
“I intended nothing about this to speak, and suffered long time, but this so sometimes you knocks out from the track that no longer you are held in control”, he stated mudi.
They know that this continued.
Sometimes you react, and then you must survive consequences, and for me it is necessary to live with the fact that I said.
Today I will go home and I will strongly sleep.
I want to walk with the highly raised head I want so that my owners would know - I do for them entire possible.
When they begin to think that this is not so, then for I had to cease to be trainer.
Then for me it is necessary to think what to make with its license.
Previously mudi sensationally stated during the interview on racing.com, that the division of ethics it attempted to spy in its stable.
“One-and-a-half year ago of Terry Beyli, Deyl Brown and doctor Brian Stewart settle in the room with the man, whom I will name, if they ask, and they proposed to it work in my stable in order to transfer information about the fact that I make in itself stable”, stated mudi on Racing.com.
They clearly consider that I am swindler.
If this is so, by them all, undoubtedly, should be given statements, since the attempt to catch me for them did not succeed.
Robert Rolston, the former chairman of RVL, David mudi, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondri, naneshniy the executive director of RVL, they knew about this always and know now.
Must not whether this force me to think that the matter does become personal?
Must not in RVL be collected courages and bring to account for the fact that does occur in this business, other people, besides the trainers?
Plokh whether I for this profession?
So whether I plokh for this profession?
It can be, people there think that this so there is.
It can be, they should take away license in me and eject me away, and I do not doubt - that I now speak, it can force them to think about this.
But I reached now that point, where to me nevertheless, and this me grieves.
To me from this it is properly sad.
I will exert pressure on them and I will lay on them responsibility for decision making.
I have support from the side of family, and I can leave.
The vexation of trainer only grew in the course of the long investigation of the case with cobalt and Lidari, and the last removal of horse from the start forced it to state that it can “fling its license for table”.
Mudi, most of all the known fact that prepared the invincible champion Black Kaviar, named requirements for the application of medical preparations during the day of competitions “laughable” after for the feet of horse was substituted compress from the clay, what is the disturbance of rules.
This is the disturbance of rules on the jumps.
“I must bear full responsibility for this, he stated.
One of my workers by mistake made compress to the foot it.
It could obtain compress last evening.
It could obtain it yesterday, as this was.
It was with it during the day of round.
Mudi it can be disqualified for three months according to rules about the application of medical preparations during the day of competitions for the use of a compress, apropos of what the stewards opened investigation.
This is anecdote.
People, which create these rules, know nothing about the horses.
“We everything understand, that to us are necessary the rules, but this visited too far”, he said mudi.
Driver, who completed visit and disappeared from the scene of crime in Kobrame, is arrested
The police arrested man, who into the output brought down motorcyclist in Kobrame and disappeared from the scene of crime.
Motorcyclist they delivered on the helicopter into the hospital of Royyal Melbourne with the serious injuries after him it brought down machine on Murray valley highway in the morning on Saturday.
In the police they said that the driver left, without having stopped not in order to help injured motorcyclist.
In Monday 50 the -year inhabitant of Nataliy city was returned the police in Sheppartone.
It is assumed that the charge in the leaving of the place of incident, refusal of aid and in the disturbance of other rules of the road will be produced for it.
Motorcyclist, 40-year inhabitant of Kobrama, remain in the hospital in the stable state.
Trainer “Melbourne Storm” Craig Bellamy it counters the charges of rivals in the application of the rigid power methods
Trainer “Melbourne Storm” Craig Bellamy named the criticism of the interception of ball his command as “the attachment of agenda” from the side of two favorites of the championship of NRL.
Trainer “sydney of Rusters” of Trent Robinson stated that the judges allowed “Stormu” “to fight” with its command during the sudden victory “of Storma” in the finale of qualification game in sydney on Friday in the evening.
Trainer “Brisbeyn Bronkos” Wayne Bennett made an explicit hint to “Storm” after his command it won the finale of qualification tournament in “Nozern queensland of Kauboyz” in the evening on Saturday, when he named this game “of typical” for the league of rugby and stated that two of the command of queensland were not “are too successful” in hand-to-hand fighting.
Bellamy protected the interception of ball by his command and he stated that they simply were concentrated on “the contact”, intercepting ball.
Bellamy added that into it the criticism of his command from the side of two chief trainers inspired confidence, since this means that them disturbs the possible defeat from “Storm”.
“This continues to float - I did not hear so that in Trent Robinson would tell about the rigid methods, when they beat us with the score 24:2”, stated Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee, that we nothing changed entire year in our systems or technicians of protection, simply in the recent six weeks we paid special attention to contacts with the interception of ball, and this became turning point for us.
By Trent there already three years and it clearly trains outstanding command, so that it, probably, did not become accustomed to lose, and for it this became a certain shaking.
It is amusing, as this is always manifested at this time year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea about “impressive football”, after reminding to their teacher, that “Saint-George-Illavarra Dregons” of Bennett they won in the championship in 2010; showing “dull” football.
Wayne speaks about the gripping football.
It decided to compare its game on Saturday in the evening with our on Friday in the evening, and to look, how impressive was their game”, noted Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010. “Saint-George” several they criticized, calling dull command, and Wayne he stated that its this not at all worries.
But now it has the command, which can show that the fact that it considers the impressive football, especially its young half-backs with their speed.
This is the football, which you would want, when you have such players.
It made this remark in 2010, and now he wants so that everything the football in its style - not in each command to eat two such half-backs as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so that they could so play.
This gives to me more than confidence, because they speak these things, since the game with us somewhat disturbs them.
Six weeks ago they, probably, did not think about us, when they reached the large games.
Bellamy also noted that the game “of Storma” and “Rusters” was contest with the large number of glasses, than the game “of Bronkos” and “of Kauboyz”.
The game “of Bronkos”, probably, was good, I yet did not see it, but what was calculation? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18, there were two additional attempts - and that, this is the impressive football?
Or to consider it as those impressing interruptions and unsuccessful attempts?
For me this rutin.
If they about us mention, this means that we can with them there meet in some stage.
In “Storma” at the end of this week of output, since they won the right to assume in themselves either “North queensland of Kauboyz” or “Kronalla Sharks” into following Saturday in the evening on the preliminary finale on the stadium of AAMI Park, tickets will be put on the market on following Tuesday in the morning.
Serbian the accused in the storage of narcotics is released under the guarantee into 200,000 dollars
The man, to whom threatens life imprisonment for the attempt to appropriate 40 kg of cocaine, delivered into queensland by smuggling, was released under the guarantee into 200 000 dollars.
By Marco Maksimovich, 29 years, one of five people, arrested in the past month after the federal police revealed 100 kilograms of narcotics on the yacht of Solay, which went from South America through Vanuatu and which was moored in Kumere in August.
During entire morning of Maksimovich and his accomplices they saw on the pier, and later it was encountered with them in the cafe of Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of narcotic in the machine of Toyota Echo.
In spite of the fact that the lifelong period for at an attempt awarding narcotic substances in the quantity, sufficient for sale, threatens to Maksimovich, the attorney of Maksimovich asserts that the proof of the fact that the latter attempted to obtain entire party, they are absent, and that man could be located in the cafe without any design.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flenagan doubted the fact that Maksimovich cost to release under the guarantee.
The latter is had connections with Serbia.
It frequently travels into Serbia”, he said in the court on Wednesday.
In the course of criminal trial it lied to the police about its location.
Of mothers and to the step-father of Maksimovich it was proposed to introduce joint guarantee into 200 000 dollars for his release.
“From indications of both it becomes obvious that the sum of the guarantee of 200 000 dollars is for them too great financial a burden”, noted judge Flenagan.
But this one measure it is insufficient as the guarantee of the fact that it will not disappear, judge added.
Maksimovich they permitted to be freed under the guarantee when it will return both its Australian and Serbian passport, it will be noted in the police daily and observe curfew from 6 hundred in the evening to 6 hours of the morning.

I talked with the trainer by Dimitrisom Itudis several times this summer and, by itself, after I was joined to the command, cites “the R-sport” of Frilenda. - To me will be actually the responsibilities of Sasha Kaun, who left command both in the shielding constructions and in the attack from the three-second zone, and I think that I can this manage.
Yes, me will be required some time to reconstruction to the position of center, nevertheless in NBA I more greatly played forward.
Now will have to more resist the large center of rival, but I already this earlier was occupied, so that I think, and now I will manage.
Line soldiers the last time won Evroligu in 2008.
From those times they six times reached “finale of fours”, but there each time they could not show their best basketball.
Exists the opinion that someone overlooked command.
In this entire game, you cannot conquer eternally.
Certainly, this is complicated, I understand entire disappointment of club and his fans.
But we have outstanding command now, and if we will show better, on that they are capable, then we have a good chance to win Evroligu, I actually then think.
He always wanted to win this title, Muscovites already conquered in the tournament, and I think, this year will be the year of the TsSKA (Central Sports Club of the Army).
As far as sglaza is concerned, I not superstitious person and believe not in what curses.
I believe in the hard work and resoluteness, if you connect these two things, then everything is possible.
I and before the games do not have any specific rituals, I simply listen to music and attempt to be weakened, how this is possible.

Let us recall that Louis Enrique trained “wolves” in the season-2011/12; however, he did not know how to appear himself from the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome after several years, in which acquired the specific experience. - it gives the official site of the UEFA Louis Enrique's word. -
Exceptionally warm memories are connected with Rome in me.
For me this there will be special game, but this is not so is important.
Main thing - to start in the League of Champions from the victory.
August meeting on the goblet of Zhoana Gampera will not influence the actions of commands in the nearest match.
I expect from “Roms” of game, which it showed in a series A against “Juventus”.
This is the strong command, which knows how to pressingovat even he knows what to make with the ball.

In the opinion of khavbeka, in their field astanintsy are capable of selecting glasses in any rival.
In spite of the fact that the match came out for us heavy, I can say that we played well, it gives the official site of the UEFA the word of Kanyasa. - To us a little was not sufficient courage in the attack.
“Benfika” above by class, but in the domestic match, I think, we can design for that in order to select they have glasses.
This is completely actual.
But it is first necessary to think about “Galatasarae”, and then about “the athletics”.
In the domestic matches we can select glasses in any.

I will not say that “the real” played ideally, but golevykh opportunities it was quite sufficient.
I am contented by the fact that we did not pass balls and drove in four.
Krishtianu to Ronaldu confirmed its level.
This is the best player in the world, I will repeat this as much as desired once.

The defender “of Barcelona” of Zhordi of Alba considers that its odnoklubnikom Lionelem Massey no one will be be able to compared.
According to the Spaniard, the forward “of real” to Krishtianu to Ronaldu also cannot this make.
Massey to five heads higher than the rest, cites Le Figaro Alba. - The fact that it is capable to make with Leo, can no one.
Even To Krishtianu to Ronaldu.
Everything changes with Leo to the field, I cannot compare him whom-or.

Meeting takes place tomorrow, beginning - into 21.45 Moscow time.
Let us recall, “SE” will conduct its text translation.
“Barcelona” - these are special rival, a good command with the excellent players, cites the official site of the UEFA De Rossi. -
It is complicated to play with the blue-pomagranate/garnet, indeed they possess not only unique style, but even and by bright individualities.
In order to leave them, for us it is necessary to plough for the elongation of entire match and to insure each other.
Massey is almost always successful, when it goes into the encircling, so that we should preserve compactness and organization.

The following match command will conduct on the departure against “It is slovana”.
I hope that I will leave in the following match in the starting composition, it gives “the R-sport” of the word of Ezhova.
I am not expert according to the goalkeepers, I goalkeeper himself, do not show the alliterations of the passed heads; therefore it is complicated to trace.
“The dynamo” played well, in all there are poor matches.
Command nevertheless lost.
I better passed a little more, but command won.

The captain “of the arsenal” of Mikel Arteta says that his odnoklubniki must support traumatized Jack Uilshira before the game with “the dynamo Zagreb”
In the conversation with Uilshirom Wenger also emphasized, that only September, and that if the restoration of Uilshira will go according to the plan, then it nothing will prevent from return to the game to Christmas.
With the most favorable course of the events of Uilshir it will accurately pass at least four following games in England and, taking into account that happening, its participation in the championship of Europe the following summer it remains open to question.
Most offensive in this recent problem the fact that Uilshir confidently finished previous season with the only injury of the ankle and was assembled to return to the customary aggressive style of game during the pre-seasonal preparation.
Wenger: “This injury does not threaten its career”.
This is simple not to the end the healed bone.
Nothing serious.
This is simple chance.
This is not connected with the ankles or with the injuries, which in it occurred earlier.
This there can be the connected things from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also allowed, there is risk of additional injuries combined with this for any player, who returns to the game in the middle of season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to the data Premier Injuries Ltd, in Uilshira is fixed by 23 different injuries, which were happened of it in six years, which passed from its debut.
Furthermore, it played only into 65 of 157 games “of arsenal” in the league for the last five seasons.
If we look at distribution for “the arsenal” wider, it is possible to note that in six of eight seasons, beginning with 2007-08, “arsenal” was one of two clubs of the Premier League, on calculation of which most of all days of the most of all passed because of the injuries.
Wenger recognizes the probability of sticking in the vicious circle, but in “the arsenal” they believe that an improvement in the statistics on the injuries in the last season will continue.
“Sometimes, after returning in build after injury, you in some period are vulnerable - in this time you should restore forces and collect competitory advantage”, Wenger said.
Jack is sufficiently young and will manage.
I hope that he will be restored physically, I am confident in this and in the fact that his career will be such, which it deserves.
Arsenal begins campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday with match s “Dynes-Zagreb” and it will continue it on Saturday by games with “Chelsea” and into the following medium - s “Tottenham Khotspur”, and Wenger is intended to conduct the rotation of composition.
Ektor Belerin and Aaron Remzi did not arrive to Croatia; therefore in the starting composition they will most likely play Mathieu Debyushi and Arteta.
Possibly, Wenger will also introduce into the composition of Kirana of Gibbs and Olive of fat instead of Nacho Morealya and Wolcott's Teo.
“I try to preserve balance and to give small respite to those players, who it require”, described Wenger.
Although “arsenal” the sure favorite in the group F, stadium “of Maksimir” in Zagreb relate to the number of those most depressing in Europe.
“Dynamo” did not lose any of 41 matches since in them it came out to conduct past season as “invincible”.
On Tuesday in the evening stadium underwent the action of earthquake by the force of 3.2 marks according to Richter's scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb in this year.
Wenger it is confident, that the arsenal mastered the lesson, obtained in the past the season, when command was defeated in the game of the League of Champions from Monaco, and it remains with the weak hope to lead club to the victory in the cup final of champions.
“This is improbable drive”, noted Wenger.
“Arsenal” still never this made.
We were very close to the purpose in 2006, but, from the other side, I realist with the period.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comic show, which taught to us the serious lessons of the male friendship
The absence of similar histories strikes, especially if we consider, the need of men for frankness became how desperate, it is now more than sometimes, with the fact that the level of suicides among the young men is located on the maximum in 15 years.
In 2013 this became the sole largest cause of death of men at the age between 20 and 45 for years in the United Kingdom, and with the men it occurs three times more frequently than with the women.
In an attempt to be dismantled at the problem “campaign against the unhappy life” declared 2015 the year of men for the purpose to defy the culture, which does not give to men to turn for help, when it is necessary to them.
Friendship is in the center of this battle in order to accept this call.
The recently conducted investigation is more than 2 000 university students, who manifest the symptoms of depression, it revealed, that if the patient has himself the sufficiently large number of friends “in the normal mood”, chances to the recovery double.
Similarly for those, who not in depression, the circle of sincerely healthy friends by half decreases the chance of the appearance of sincere disorders.
But, of course, so that the friendship would work, it is first of all necessary that it would be.
In the epoch, when communication are governed by the social networks, when they prefer style to the content, answering interval often values more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, that love merriment and successful, even if in reality reigns solitude.
This surface success depends on the fact that the psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, pillar due to the internal values, our internal tendency toward the personal increase and friendship, which more strongly influences our sincere health.
And, as recently noted one billionaire, the creator of video games, for the money you will not in general purchase more than happiness.
The merit of Friends in the fact that they assign on this attention.
Each of the characters was determined not through their work, but, it is faster, through the personality, who appeared in the communication with the friends.
The humor of Dzhoui and constant embraces of Chandler, the moments of the survey of football on the convenient chairs, Ross's vozdykhaniya on Reychel - all proceeds from understanding of the fact that the men can feel this, even if they frequently abstain from a complete study of their feelings.
As told me colleague “Samaritens”: “… my role of listener for the people, which perceive depression and suicidal moods, emphasizes that, as even the smallest communication of friends it can bring benefit”.
Frequently those men, which turn to us, feel themselves unable to speak to friends.
Old lecture “live with this” strongly, just as a feeling, that the frank conversation about the problems can be perceived as weakness”.
Friends are one of those the show, which comes to the mind, when I attempt to propose the more prolonged working mechanisms of overcoming.
It emphasized the unobtrusive moments of male friendship.
Concerning my task, status of stranger, which converses on the telephone, helps people at the moments of desperation, whereas lasting support goes from the neighbor family circle and friends.
Thus, if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central into these output, where decorations completely restored for the holiday, why not to take its friends to drink in Central Perk.
Or, it is still better - if in Starbucks you see lonely person, smile and say “regards”.
Previously to not guess, what benefit friendship can bring.
The series of Friends shows on Comedy Central from the beginning also to ends, all 236 series, on TEG of #FriendsFest
Di Mary drives in goal, helping “PSZH” to destroy “malm”
Angel di Mary on the level Blezom Matyuydi and Edinsonom Kavani celebrates the oppressed balls into the gates “malm”.
Angel di Mary, making a debut in the League of Champions, drove in goal, than made it possible “PSZH” easy to go around “malm” on Tuesday.
Here is report about the match and reaction to the game.
Angel di Mary and Edinson to Kavani made their matter, when “with bet of hays-Zhermen” she began its game in the League of Champions from extremely convenient victory 2:0 against “malm” on the stadium park de Prens on Tuesday.
Di Mary clogged ball less than in four minutes after began its first game in the League of Champions as the player “of PSZH”, in order to assign direction to the champions of France, but they missed a whole series of opportunities before their advantage, when Kavani drove in goal on 61-y to minute, finally increased.
Together with “real by Madrid” and by Donets “miner” in the group A, “bet” it was necessary to take a good beginning in the game against the champions of Sweden, since they were aimed not at the qualification play off, but for the continuation of a series of the successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached before the quarter-finals.
They earned glasses, but was at the same time the not best solution from Loran's side Blanc to calculate Zlatana Ibragimovicha by useless in the attack and more lately replace him by the field in the game against the command from his home town and club, in which it began its brilliant career into 1999.
“This is complex - to win houses or in the guests in the League of Champions, so that to gain the victory of with the score 2:0, to deliver to the rivals of problems and excellently to play in the protection - this good began, even if there are other moments, which to us must be finished during the season”, said Blanc.
This hopefully.
We wanted to win, and we made this, although I feel sorry, that we did not clog to one or two balls more.
Ibragimovich returned after injury in one of the replacements in the composition of Parisian command, which brought to it by nichyu of with the score 2:2 in the match with “the claret” in the first league into the output, but it moved aside to the background di Mary for the fourth minute.
Argentinean attacking they noted as player, capable of deriving “PSZH” on the new level in Europe, after it in the past month they redeemed u “Manchester United”, and it proved, why, when it ran out to the pass from Marco Verratti behind the protection “malm” and it beautifully completed attack, after sending ball past Yokhana Villanda into the distant angle of gates.
However, if someone expected then from “PSZH” of light and large victory, to them it was necessary to be disappointed.
“Malm”, which defeated Seltik into the play off in order to reach this stage, having consisting nine players of the world level in the field at the beginning of game, five defenders even two supporting half-backs in the middle of field, he was serious enemy.
But, with exception of the impact of Nikoly Dzhurdzhicha, with which the ball flew past the distant rod of Kevin Trappa's gates on 34-y to minute, they attacked entirely a little.
Then “PSZH” at times brought itself by nonproductive transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibragimovicha, which only in the first half could not realize not less than five attempts, and then could not process the ball, oppressed of Kavani immediately after the renewal of game.
Nevertheless, it showed itself considerably more skillful in the precise passes, and this was pass from Ibragimovicha, after obtaining which, Di Mary sent ball by the twisted impact, which passed vpritirku to the rod past Wieland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was at long last oppressed after hour mark because of Kavani, urugvaets drove in its sixth ball in the season after Ibragimovich it touched up the ball, sent to the center field from the left flank by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas, which were u “malm” relative to the return to the game, and only interception of ball by Wieland from the close distance did not allow David Louis to increase final calculation, before to left to the replacement Esekelyu Lavessi did not include goal in the very tail piece of match.
Trainer “malm” to Age Khareyde more lately recognized that PSG were the class higher than his command, in this case the Norwegian described: “Our last game in the League of Champions took place in December last year”.
From those times we played only in the Swedish league, but this is not that level.
Of qualifications it is insufficient.
Glory “of bet”!
This was wonderful match with them.

For considering the finalists of show to Deymonu and Brown were joined the colleague-producers Ben Affleck and the brothers of Farelli.

The original of the complaint of Kadyrov according to the book “entreaty to the god” entered into the Yuzhno-Sakhalin court.
In the Yuzhno-Sakhalin city court entered the original of the appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov of the solution about the acknowledgement “extremist material” of the book “entreaty to the god: its value and place in Islam”, reports “Interfax” with the reference to the chairman of gorsuda Alexander Chukhraya.
Now court waits the possible objections of participants in the process.
Chukhray refused to comment on the statements of some Deputies of the Gosduma RF about the need for verifying gorsud to the possible collaboration with the foreign intelligence agencies and IGIL.
“Let they themselves comment on such stupidities”, he said.
On September 11 Yuzhno-Sakhalin city public procurator department gave appeal of the decision of judge Natalie Perchenko about the acknowledgement of the book “extremist material”.
From the prosecutor's office of Yuzhno Sakhalinsk arrived the appeal on Friday in the evening.
There are the nuances: in the prosecutor's office they consider that they requested court to recognize as extremist only opinion of the author of this book, but not ayat from the Koran.
In the opinion of the prosecutor's office, judge was made an incorrect decision”, reported Chukhray.
The solution about the acknowledgement of the book “extremist material” was accepted on August 12, 2015.
In particular, “extremist” were named quotations from the Koran - “to you we worship and you we pray about the aid”, whereas “do not appeal to no one together with Allah”.
Kadyrov named those made decision by the book “shaitans and provocateurs”.
Deputies of the Gosduma it called to legislatively forbid the court decisions, which are concerned the texts of the Scriptures.
“I am solidly convinced of the fact that the State Duma must accept the law, in accordance with which it is forbidden to assume in the judicial order of the solutions, which are concerned directly the texts of the Koran and other godly writings”, wrote Kadyrov in his Instagram.
Facebook will move away the commentaries, which insult of migrants and refugees,
Colleagues “Facebook” are intended to move away posts and commentaries, in which is given negative estimation to migrants and refugees.
Furthermore, social network will show financial support to the organizations, which collect the complaints of users of the unlawful content.

Thus, the day before the head of department Khayko Maas stated that at present the Justice Department together with the specialists of social network deals with the creation of the special group of moderators.
Its participants are obligated to track commentaries and to move away incorrect with respect to the migrants and refugees.
According to Maas's Khayko, it is assumed that the authors of intolerant posts will obtain information with the indication of the reason for the removal of their record.
To contribute to the operational blocking of unlawful content are also must the organizations, whose specialists deal with the collection coming complaints of the insulting posts of coming from the users of social network.
The management “of Facebook” is intended to show by them necessary financial support.
The solution about the removal of the posts, which contain negative statements in the address of migrants and refugees, by the management of social network and by the Ministry of Justice of Germany was accepted after in the German segment “of Facebook” sharply they grew xenophobic moods.
One of the most obvious occasions for them became unprecedented to its scales migratory crisis, which enveloped EU countries for a while back.
Thus, in Germany are already today overfilled all points, intended for positioning the refugees.

The zones for the relaxation will appear on the Moscow cemeteries.
Soon immediately several capital cemeteries equip with the specialized zones for relaxation and psychological leisure.
In the number of the first will prove to be Butovskoe, Domodedovo, and Shcherbin cemetery.

In the opinion of the specialists, in such “corners” the visitors of cemeteries can rest, stay in private with themselves and restore psychological forces.
Soon zones for the relaxation will construct in the Domodedovo, Butovskom and Shcherbin cemeteries, and then in other regions of the capital.
According to the head GBU “ritual”, with the appearance of the need of expanding the areas of cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest tracts in a maximally possible volume.
Green planting will serve as the living fence, which will divide the zones of leisure and areas, diverted directly under the places for the burial.
Experts GBU “the ritual” also stated about their intention to introduce proposal about the failure of the fences during the burials.
New cemeteries actually can become barrier-free.
Furthermore, in GBU “ritual” they described about the willingness to study the installation of the electronic terminals, with the aid of which the visitors of cemeteries can learn GPS-coordinates and indentification tags of burials.
In June this year in GBU “the ritual” they also proposed to correct the cost of services on the burial depending on the season.
Thus, the digging of grave in the summer time will cost to thousands of rubles cheaper, week in winter, when the earth frozen through.
Let us note that in last year of valuation to all forms of ritual services they became more expensive on the average by 10 percent.
In the Yelnya forests after five days they found strayed gribnika.
Elderly man proved to be living, although he conducted in the forest more frequent more than hundred hours without provisions.
To reveal grief-gribnika was possible because of the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, the correspondent: “79--year pensioner from the Tambovo region conducted in the forest five days.”
Without the food and water.
It searched for relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even dog specialists with the dogs, but there was no result.
To reveal man it was possible after to the search operations it was connected helicopter.
During that day Vitalius Alexandrovich as usually left for the forest after opyatami and rough-stemmed boletus, but he did not return toward the evening.
Relatives immediately turned for help, and to the searches for gribnika were already next day raised rescuers and interested inhabitants from the adjacent village - a total of about 30 people.
To the fifth day to them the helicopter of fire-rescue center was joined.
Andrey Seletkov, the chief of the search and rescue group of the force of the fire-rescue center of Smolenskaya Oblast, described: “Helicopter they drew, man was discovered.”
It left very far, completely elsewhere.
This was approximately for 12 km from the place of searches.

To conduct the economy - the Nobel laureate: the globalization
To unseal the processes of globalization had to contribute to reduction in the inequality in the world.
In reality situation appears otherwise, the difference in the incomes of population in the developing economies, on the contrary, grows.
Eric Maskin.
In order this to correct, it is necessary to promote of the education of the low-qualified workers, count the main scientific worker of the international laboratory of analysis and decision of HSE [National Research University "Higher School of Economics"], Nobel prize winner on Eric Maskin's economy of 2007.
In the last twenty years peace survived an unprecedented increase in the global markets.
The commercial boundaries between the countries became ever more opened.
The supporters of globalization forecast the large gaines for the developing economies.
“These forecasts in many respects happened”, emphasizes Maskin.
So, for example, China and India obtained a serious increase the GDP [Gross Domestic Product] per capita in the population.
However, not all so cheerfully.
It was expected that the globalization will reduce the precipice between “the propertied” and “indigent” in the poor countries, which is manifested in the large inequality of incomes, or more precisely - the remuneration for labor.
But in reality this inequality only increased, notes Eric Maskin in its article “why global markets they did not descend inequality in the developing economies”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which it transferred and cites NIE of HSE [Higher School of Economics].
Together with the economist, professor of Harvard University Michael Cramer Eric Maskin it developed the alternative theory, which demonstrates, why the difference in the incomes in the poor countries in proportion to an increase in the globalization increases, resembles NIE of HSE [Higher School of Economics].
Specific processes occur on the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Maskin separates four levels of the qualification of specialists - A and B for rich countries, with D - for the poor.
To specialists D from the poor countries level of qualification is not sufficient after globalization, in order to cooperate with the specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if in the workers of level S from the poor countries wage grows because of cooperation with the colleagues of B from the rich, then the workers D of increase do not perceive or their wage completely they fall.
Total effect is such, that the internationalization of production will contribute to an increase of the break in the remuneration for labor between two professional categories in the poor countries and with respect to an increase in the level of inequality.
By Cramer and E. Maskinym proposed the amazingly beautiful model, alternative of the rikardianskoy theory of comparative advantages.
It makes it possible to explain, why globalization led to the inequality in the incomes, say Fuad Aleskerov, ordinary professor, manager of the international laboratory of analysis and decision, leader of the department of mathematics of HSE [National Research University "Higher School of Economics"].
And as any powerful theory, I am confident, she will lead to the splash of empirical works in this region.
The solution of problem, in the opinion of Erica Maskina, consists in an increase in the level of the education of the low-qualified workers.
However, workers themselves, as notes scientist, do not have to this means, but to companies to disadvantageously pay their instruction.
In this situation significant role can play governments, international agencies, NKO and particular funds, is counted Maskin.
Scientist notes that the developed theory on no account calls to the stoppage of the process of globalization, which brought and it brings its fruits in the form of the increase the GDP [Gross Domestic Product] of the countries.
Derbent: the living connection of times.
Derbent - one of the most ancient cities of Russia - in September notes its 2000-anniversary.
In the program of holiday measures - festival of the national cultures of the peoples of Daghestan and fair in the style of past times, the exhibition of derbentskikh carpets and the day of the open temples, historico-musical show “2000 years for two hours” and excursions into the reconstructed museum of Peter of the I.
The medieval stones of the fortress of Naryn-feces, ancient Arab inscriptions on the walls, narrow by-streets and palace gardens - all this as if descended from the pages “thousand and one night”.
Derbent - the only city of Russia, which was preserved at its place from the antique times.
Although to it pretended Roman empire, Byzantium, the Hazar khanate and gold horde.
The age of the eastern platans, which grow in the court of derbentskoy Dzhuma-mosque, is equal to several centuries.

The building of city began from magalov - blocks with the one-storeyed rock buildings.
Barely they changed in the long years of magaly.
Only satellite plates, conditioners on the walls and street lamps resemble that you are situated not in the medieval, but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city were preserved the components of the water pipe, built by Persians approximately thousand years ago.
To the present reached the ancient sources, in which the local residents today collect water.
Many derbenttsy prefer to ordinary water from the cranes water from historical the fountains checked.

The hands of potters now make the remarkable ceramic parts both of practical and souvenir designation.
In the days holidays and festivals the crowds of spectators are collected under the stretched rope, on which come out the students of the republic school of circus art.
The history of the surprising and risky craftsmanship counts several centuries.
New tendency - among the rope walkers increasingly more frequent it is possible to see girls.
In the accomodation of the former maidenly bath today works the museum “culture and way of life of ancient Derbent”.
Unmarried girls and brides in tracking of friends earlier here washed, and now any desiring can see arched-domelike hall, hot and cold ponds, which left into the past of equipment for bathing.
In the majority of the houses of Derbent there is hot water, but baths and paired during our days are popular just as in the bylye times.
On the benefit of the heating of organism it is written by vapor in the ancient books.
The blood is improved after bath, muscles lose fatigue, organism acquires flexibility and ease.
In the festival “collaboration”, which is passed in the territory of the fortress of Naryn-feces, take part etnopodvory of many regions of Daghestan.
Participants in the national suits dance, play people melodies, fulfill the songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and entertain visitors by tasty domestic cheese.
Kyrkhlyar - the graveyard of forty martyrs, who prevailed heads for Islam.
This is one of the most respected complexes for the Muslims of the North Caucasus.
Sarcophaga the turned yellow from the time are carved from the one-piece rock blocks and are oriented, as it is accepted in Arabs, along the axis the West-east.
The brothers of Gabriels and Albert Yakubovy cut and shave clients in the small salon near the upper market.
Barbershop on this place are located already many years.
The methods of tsiryulnogo craft are transferred from generation to generation.
In this case the brothers of Yakubovy can make not only the traditional, but also most contemporary hair-do.
On one of the streets of old city was preserved the house, in which lived the exiled in the Caucasus writer-decembrist Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinskiy.
After learning Turkish language and after gathering ethnographical material, it described Derbent first third of XIX century with its ancient monuments, life and way of life of townspeople.
Chaykhana - the traditional club of the east, where will be given only tea and domestic baking.
Men come to here quench thirst, to meet with the friends and to solve some working problems.
As in the past times, to women to step over the threshold of chaykhany is not recommended.
Derbentskiy dancing ensemble “the Caspian Region” was created three years ago, but already it had time to participate in the measures of republic and Russian level.
The soloists of ensemble rehearse each day, learning to the perfection people Avar, darginskie, tatskie, Armenian dances.
With the offensive of the evening, when noise calms down and ignite street lamps, local residents are seated at the shops near the houses with the appearing terraces.
As a rule, derbenttsy discuss everyday questions.
But on the threshold of the anniversary they increasingly more frequently recall the episodes of the unique history of their city, which influenced the fate of entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
In Domodedovo it passed business “game into the airport”.
In the capital the new form of instruction is tested.
Four hundred students tried themselves in the role of the colleagues of airport.
For this in Domodedovo were installed the models of three aviagavaney.
Young people not only inspected and recorded passengers, but they also attended aircraft.
All this - in the form business game; however, in the complexity it was not inferior to reality.
The been late voyages, immediately two passengers with the breaks aboard, ladder was lost somewhere along the road to the aircraft.
For the present airport - hell.
For that, which was based in the hangar of Domodedovo - standard collection of the tasks, which one must solve for newcomers.
In one hangar were accomodated immediately three large airports from the different countries of the world.
In them four hundred students from capital colleges and VUZ (Institute of Higher Education) today work.
Unprecedented chance to learn everything about internal peace of aviagavani.
The registration of passengers, servicing aircraft, revolution of luggage - to them entrusted even buses in the landing area, ladders and examination of passengers.
And passengers - continuously problematic.
In one disorders with the documents, another was late to the voyage, the third filled bag with suspicious objects.
And to be dismantled with all this necessarily as in the life - within the minimum period.
For each of these executed tasks by it is added to the specific sum, virtual cash resources, as if airline paid off to them the appropriate sums for the maintenance of voyage.
“For the nonfulfillment of the corresponding tasks from them exacts itself penalty”, is explained in the interview for program “Conduct-Moscow” the financial analyst of the game Dmitriy Khilko.
The officials from the ministry of formation fixedly follow proceeding.
For them this examination - attempt to test the new form of instruction.
They already found place in the course of average vocational education by it.
“Will be formed six interregional centers of scope, which will become, in the essence, the new models of the activity of contemporary colleges with the contemporary system for control, with the highly qualified personnel, with the contemporary equipment”, tells the Department Director of government policy in the sphere of the preparation for working personnel and additional vocational education of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia Natalie Zolotarev.
Then to students - not to the global plans.
After three days of this training by it is, it seems, will be required output.
Then estimations for this examination had completely material expression.
The newest smart-glasses, best, which I sometimes saw!
“I obtained them for the fact that in proper time he answered the claim to our airport in Instagram”, were contented a participant in the game, PR-manager of command “airport Frankfurt” Sergey Shuvalov.
Best of judge, which is called, took for the pencil in order up to the moment of the completion of studies to invite to itself to the work.
The embassy of the USA will regret about closing of American center in Moscow.
American embassy in Russia expressed regret in connection with closing acted American center of acted in the library of foreign literature.
Center worked in Moscow more than 22 years.
The embassy of the USA in Moscow deeply will regret about the unilateral decision of Russian government to shut the American center of the embassy of the USA in the All-Russian state library named M.I. Rudomino in Moscow.
“The one-sided steps, undertaken by RF recently, bring into question the adherence of the government of Russia to the connections between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even in the times of the Cold War and at other complex moments of the long history of the relations of our countries”, it is said in the statement of the ambassador of the USA John Tefft, which entered into “Interfax”.
American center created the deep and durable bonds between the people and culture of Russia and United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and it also served as the place of conducting meetings with the numerous American eminent figures, among whom there were the cosmonauts, artists, athletes, scientists, policy and writers.
“Only in the past year American center conducted more than 400 cultural and educational measures and accepted more than 50,000 Russian visitors”, emphasized diplomat.
Tefft remembered that approximately one year was ago accepted the solution to shut one additional joint Russian-American project - the program of the educational exchanges of FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
Green tribunal proved to be fast to the violence.
Typical situation: four officials stand before judge Svatanter's table coumarone resin, listening his claim to the accomplished work.
Court is not completely satisfied by the quality of your work.
We not for that granted to you 110-page order so that you above it would amuse themselves, says coumarone resin. -
If one additional brick will be assumed, we will order to lay all existing buildings.
Coumarone resin heads the national green tribunal (NZT) - the organ of judicial authority, founded in 2010 in order to stop the swift environmental pollution, which accompanies stormy economic growth in the recent decades.
In this time the tribunal had time to examine more than 10,000 actions, connected with air pollution, by the collection of garbage, by geological developments, by toxic withdrawals and by the building of dams.
In two of three cases the court makes decision about the curtailment of the building, which leads to the pollution.
Rates are improbably high: in the incomplete 60 years, which passed from the moment of the declaration of the independence of the intensive industrial development India became from the country of virgin jungle one of the most overpopulated and contaminated countries of the world.
Especially sharply problem stands in the large megapolises, where the development of infrastructure does not have time after the swift urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and withdrawals of enterprises and household economics, and a few remained habitable tracts are cut down under the building by new residential sections.
In spite of the formal support of green motion from the side of state, NZT it regularly undergoes criticism from the side of the government of Narendry Modi, since it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of the largest investment projects.
Thus, in May this year the minister of environment named Court decisions “extreme” and “impracticable”.
Sometimes Court decisions actually cannot be carried out within the set by court period, confirms attorney in the ecological matters of Radzh Pandzhvani.
However, impracticable dedlayny have the positive side: at least, they make it necessary responsible people to stir.
“Its central objective - to shake this system up”, adds attorney.
Green tribunal already repeatedly abolished the large building: on its calculation the curtailment of the building of airport, power station and hundreds of smaller construction.
In this case about the people they try also to not forget: for example, during the consideration of the fate of pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnana, which contaminiated local river by fluoride.
We can shut your factory, but we answer also for the economic consequences.
“People will lose job”, commented on its solution coumarone resin.
However, similar explanations far from always find the understanding in simple people, whose life can change because of one flourish of judical feather.
Thus, in April tribunal made the decision to forbid to all vehicles of older than 10 years entrance into the capital how caused public resentment.
In spite of the sharply fallen popularity and squall of criticism, Svatanter the coumarone resin refused to revoke this decision.
Instead of this it ordered in the government of Delhi statistics about the entering and leaving motor transport, and also introduced proposal to stock 10,000 additional buses up, having preliminarily learned at the factories, in the state they to carry out a similar order.
In proportion to that how into the sphere of the attention of court began to fall such sources of pollution as dumps, quality of fuel and even road incidents, people anger began gradually to calm down.
But of the sickest with theme fundamental judge became program on cleaning of river the ganges, with the pump announced by Prime Minister Narendroy Modi in the past year.
When the discussion turns to the ganges - the sacred for the Hindus river, judge frequently will cease to hold in control his emotions and passes to the cry.
You do know that does indicate the word “saint”?
Someone poured out water from the ganges to the statue of god, and in it feces proved to be, is excited judge. -
You continue to contaminiate river, because you think: The ganges this is the ganges, it will take all our sins away.
