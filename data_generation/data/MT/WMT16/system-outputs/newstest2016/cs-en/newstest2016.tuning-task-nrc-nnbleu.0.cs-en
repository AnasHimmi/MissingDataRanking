When an emergency call, the Professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend
During the calls to the emergency line to his voice Professor Shannon lamb admitted to police that he shot his girlfriend, and it is necessary to come to their home.
Lamb himself, that his "sweet little dog 'was alive and probably upset the house, and that the contacts on the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on the White Paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back, I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me," said the letter signed by Lamb, who, according to authorities.
There was no suspicion that the lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would he go 300 miles on a school campus, where police believe he shot favorite professor Ethan Schmidt in the door of his office.
The police chief in the Delta State University Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
Lamb said the fateful phone call to an emergency line shortly after.
Then came another death; lamb took his own life when police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school to students and faculty, to hide behind a locked door, the responsible authority is still trying to figure out what was the lamb's motivation.
The details, released by investigators on the side of the State and the students and staff who knew him, and together they created the image of a talented, but probably a troubled teacher.
Students have confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt himself included lamb in the book, which he wrote, in a thank-you "great people" with whom he shared an academic life.
They both taught at the School of Social Sciences and history, together with the other 17 members of the faculty, and many students took classes in both at the same time.
At the same time, inclination have occurred regarding the problems.
A student who extolled the lamb, Brandon beavers, said he also appeared agitated and shaky, "as if there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that it is faced with stress at the end of the academic year HWC 2014-15.
Lamb has previously applied for Delta state university for some time off for health reasons, when it stated that he has a problem.
And this year only taught two online courses.
The recent changes regarding the recruitment of University meant that a Phd on which lamb worked hard, he would be guaranteed automatic tenure to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge stated that he knew of no conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. lamb obviously worried about something."
To answer these questions, we have lamb.
After he left the campus, the police caught his foot when he crossed the border of the State of Arkansas back into misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, the lamb killed jedinýmvýstřelem pistol at the yard house about a mile from his parents on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington State confirmed the coroner, methel Johnson.
A car left running outside on the street.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went into this house, although Johnson said that he probably knew the people who lived there.
Lamb in this country grew up.
Lamb started work at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009, and taught geography and hours of training.
In the spring, he got a doctorate in education.
One of the long-time friends lamb described him as a bright, charismatic and funny man.
Carl Hairston indicated that she was 15 and lamb, 20, when they met through mutual friends.
She was with friends in high school and he was a great old guy, who, several years tutoring her guitar playing.
It was a heartbreaker.
The heart of all of the girls softened as soon as he appeared, "said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in a suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss together allegedly went for some time.
During the emergency call, Lamb said: "I killed my wife," but the record of marriage never existed.
Had a dog named lightning, who lived with them in a brick house, which adjoins the cutoff Gautier.
The police said that the dog was fine.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O ’ Steen, said that he broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends and they had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"she was completely collapsed," said O ’ Steen about his daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
O ’ Steen said he met with lamb, but through his daughter Abigail to know that lamb was interested in music and playing the blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss, along with Abigail vystuopovali at Summer Festival three years ago.
Later played together random gigy.
O ’ Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentice was a nurse, who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender, and occasional entertainment coordinator in the julep room, a dimly lighted bar near Gautier, said he last saw lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, sweat, what lamb played guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"it was just a happy couple," he said.
We fooled around on each other and were a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, killed a professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in Native American and a colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the Student Government and the boys' club for students.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, with about 900 people, including members of the faculty, staff, students and members of the Community, took part in the consultation events with candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt vigílie also attended, during which the University choir sang "bright morning star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, the school started again.
"we're trying to get our students back," says La Forge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Girl herself for the Associated Press, Emily wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story has been amended to reflect the fact that the police are now saying that the lamb made a phone call to an emergency line after killing Schmidt, and although Lamb called Prentiss, his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.

8 electoral numbers, which show that Donald Trump in real light
Some were trying to identify a man who often change their minds.
The others walked away as a joke.
And some are preparing for the implosion.
But some Republicans Donald Trump trying to pull down from the top of the polls, they're not (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead for a two-digit number, and some people are beginning to seriously ask what it means for nomination chances of real estate tycoon.
Of course, it's still only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of the year 2011 did lead the way for the rise of Rick Perry, Herman Cain, in the end, neither of them did not win a single position in the nominating process.
There are many reasons why they might encounter in the general election.
But the outside groups like super PACs Jeb Bush and economic conservative group club for growth are aware trumpovu will endure and began unloading their dollars on the table in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent poll numbers, which suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
The evaluation trumpovo turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, monmouth university poll showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate tycoon.
In mid-July it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
He now has six of the 10 Republicans to take a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are in the early stages.
The quinnipiac university poll, conducted last week, found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Donald Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN / ORC poll, which was conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" with Donald Trump as a candidate.
Only two of the 10 reported that they were "outraged" of his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as trump (43 percent of people said that they would be "enthusiastic" against 40 percent who say the same of Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if Jeb Bush the favorite to become the nominee.
Most Republicans see Trump as a temper problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide is receptive to the idea that the real estate magnate has the right temperament for the presidency, according to Monday's vote, ABC News / Washington Post.
The same number are holding senatorial club in the State of Iowa, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality of a leader, according to quinnipiac from last week.
Yet 44 percent think he has the personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 in 10 independents, saying that his temperament is not one to the White House, according to ABC / post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When he puts on his učenecké hats, Republican voters think Trump is the real candidate.
On the question of who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was the best choice, according to the CNN / ORC poll from last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: the GOP voters had in the past, the brightest crystal ball.
At this time last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans selected as the winner of a Rick Perry candidacy against 28 percent for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.
Yet, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump as a credible campaign.
Even if Republicans had gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everybody.
Some scholars point out that a fragmented field is likely to contribute to trump's lead, while aid is anti-trumpovská diffusely dispersed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But monmouth university poll from early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always majority support.
Carly fiorinou leads by 13 points, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, John kasichem 33 points in each.
He's in a race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead over businessman about broad 19 points in a hypothetical match one against one.
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters argue that he has already made his opinion.
On Tuesday, the new CBS / nyt poll shows that just over half of voters supporting trump maintains that she will not change her mind.
It is obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that he never changed his mind.
46 percent of States that keep options open for change among the candidates.
Yet Trump's current strongest opponent his outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who regard their minds in the final, if they were twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans allegedly agrees with Trump on immigration issues.
Even from the moment Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech, immigration remains the central topic of conversation as the main and for 2016.
Some fear that the bombast of Trump to lure key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and the damage of a re-branding effort.
But according to Monday's new ABC / Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans argue that agrees with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will also stay.
Frustration with the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are today roughly half the support from Republican voters, especially given their underdog status.
Six out of 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC / Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry at Washington.
The Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa a few weeks ago, revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated Republicans in Congress, 54 percent is "unhappy" and 21 percent "angry as hell."
The House of Representatives supported a greater share of State charges for coal.
The Czech Republic receives more than $400 million.
The Chamber of Deputies in a first reading The government supported Amendments to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of revenue from fees to open-cast mining brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised members that, because they get extra money as the Treasury, municipal budgets.
The draft was criticized by members of the opposition, who fear that the mining companies won't want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they pay higher fees directly to the state government supported rozpočtu.sněmovna at first reading amendments to the Mining Act, which among other things means that the State should receive a greater proportion of revenue from royalties from mining brown coal from mining companies.
The State ’ s share will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will be reduced from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also is changing the method of calculating reimbursement for the minerals that the firm mined.
The change in charges for the extraction of minerals is to bring to the Treasury about 427 million kroner more than in 2013.
Revenue for the municipal government has to have a neutral impact, because the fee is to be higher.
In the year of the fees received from roughly 450 million kroner and the State budget of 150 million kronor.
From brown coal mining was about $200 million for municipalities and State 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in payments from the mining space to the mining for 1,000 kronor per hectare per year.
The revenue from these charges is still in its entirety belong to municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) members said that the municipalities that gain a year instead of the 14 million to 100 million kroner.
The amount of mining fees won't be determined by law, but her set by government decree.
The payment will be calculated by multiplying the number of newly harvested the mineral and rates for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, is the reason for the amendment, among other things, the possibility of flexible reactions to the current economic situation.
MP ODS Marek Benda but warned that setting the fee by government may not be in line with the Constitution.
According to the Minister, but the doctor isn't in this case because the State tax levied on mineral, which is state property.
The fees, receive only municipalities, whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep-sea mining coal will get three quarters of the money municipalities and a quarter of the State.
The same ratio will also be the case for the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money, which the State mining royalties will be ring-fenced.
For example, 28 percent will have to go on damage control, after logging, mining or to provide emergency services.
The draft criticized opposition MPs who claimed, in particular, that the municipalities affected by the mining region.
For example a (TOP 09 and mayors) warned that mining companies no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they pay higher fees directly into the State budget.
"it is not possible to tunnel in one of the poorest regions, because the Minister of Finance to improve budget," said David Kádner (dawn) elected in Ústí.
Before the surge in unemployment pro MP warned KSČM Han aulická.
Kádner aulická unsuccessfully proposed amendments and rejected, he wanted to go back to the government the Škoda completion.
In the explanatory memorandum is that, according to the mining companies to increase fees reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent of the contracted in the long term.
The main consumers such as power plants or CHP should therefore not feel price growth.
"on the other hand, however, this increases the risk that mining companies will be compensated for the increase of efforts to reduce its operating expenses, which primarily means reducing the number of employees," says the government.
It is, however, an increase in fees from the point of view of employment.
According to the rapporteur, to the novel by Milan Urbana (ČSSD) is the key to members before the approval of the law knew the conclusions on the updated Energy Concept, and especially the government's decision about the limits on coal mining.
If coal will also benefit the limits, then it will have implications for the proceeds for the State and municipalities, he pointed out.
Urban disagrees with Mládek, in that the decision of the breaking down of the Czechoslovak army should fall until after 2020.
The limits of the CSA down, he says, should break it for social reasons, and because of the long term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Jolly will lead the Czechs as the number one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear in the Davis Cup draw Thursday baráže in India on the board and this time, every one of them would probably even in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil is planning that, given the difficult conditions to spread the load across the quartet.
In Delhi, there is heat and high humidity, so expect challenging matches, which could stretch to five sets.
We need to take that into account.
I'd like it spread by the weather.
And how will it look in practice today, he said, from the selection of downtown gladyou kumára khánny.
With the number one team in the world, and forty George cheerful counts in both Friday and Sunday's singles.
The two are likely to roll over to Luke jelly and Radek Štěpánek.
I'd like to engage in almost everyone.
Slowly, I got it in my head, but I won't say it, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech lineup should be štěpánkova participation in Saturday's doubles.
It's just a question of who will stand beside an experienced deblisty, who is in doubles in the Davis Cup record 18: 4.
It probably won't be happy.
Options with jelly, or Adam pavláskem.
"I really don't know who and how it will look," he said.
Decide according to the evolution of the singles.
Option may be Pavlásek, with a surprise in the first round of doubles, winning over Australians.
"it's nice to play some doubles," he said.
Against Australia, I did it right, and if I'm playing, I'd like to show the same performance, I've been there since the second set.
"I'm glad for the experience and I'd like to get a point," said Pavlásek.
Domestic singles to Yuki bhambriho (125th in the ATP rankings), who won a challenger last week in Shanghai, where he beat players ranked third and fourth hundreds.
Two will be somdev devvarman (164).
They are both players of challengerů and our experience of the ATP Tour, but a lot of times, we saw that in the Davis Cup rankings to decide.
"the present form, the weather," he said.
Friday's opening singles start at 6: 30 CET and can stretch out because of the weather.
Rain is forecast and Kurt is not under the roof.
However, the play may, in artificial light.
I lit it and it has some two thousand Lux, which is enough.
"it should be a tap out under the lights," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut at Prime Minister's questions
Since his election Mr corbyna pmq's debut in the most eagerly awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will have its debut in Prime Minister's questions later for the first time, and will have to work with David Cameron.

This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of the leadership of Mr. corbyho, coming after his appointment to the Shadow Cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the TUC's Annual Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence for the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was met with criticism from a number of conservative members and is the centre of attention a couple of stories on the front page of the newspapers.
The decision of Mr corbyna no singing the national anthem has attracted attention on yourself
A spokesman for Mr. corbyna said he would be "stood in respectful silence" and recognise "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of the Shadow Cabinet, Mr corbyna, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that labouristickému leaders recommended that the national anthem to sing "notwithstanding" his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in a top team of Mr corbyna, citing differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party had initially supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work also "add" following the appointment of Mr corbyna over his position in the European Union and the government limit benefits.
Mr. corbyl said at the TUC conference that workers' Party putting forward amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the limit.

Mr Corbyn is the fifth leader of the Labour party, he faced David Cameron in the last decade since his election as Conservative leader.
The leader of the Labour Party, who promised a different approach to politics, he says he has some ideas "from the crowd," the questions for Mr Cameron and received more than 30 000 proposals.
Islington North MP claims that pmq is too confrontational and refrain from how "ready answers," sprocket, trade, and instead, he promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn argues that Angela Eagle, the shadow Business Secretary, will represent him at pmq, when it will not participate — like, for example, when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
Also dropped from the thoughts that he would let other colleagues to do it from time to time, because of that, the whole matter discussed with Speaker of the house John bercowem.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said that he wants to divert from the Punch and Judy style of politics "," which was often associated with pmq, but a few years later, he admitted that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, was seen as a key barometer of pmq's judgment, leaders of the house and their leadership position among other MP, although critics argued that became a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.

Among these was a two-year-old baby boy or girl.

Metcash's campaign in the country, to fight invasion, Aldi
Metcash's IgA stores try to protect from the onslaught of Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Metcash's campaign in the country, to fight invasion, Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers, and the first of the more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, metcash and IgA supermarkets to strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build brand iga with marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IgA retailers and suppliers to add brands such as an ice cream maker based in dunsborough Simmo's tastings in Iga stores and the store owners are selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League, local customers.
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defence strategy of 29 September, when sales of food, liquor and hardware will celebrate its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake here, because southern and western Australia account for almost 30 percent of metcash IgA business steps and generate a higher turnover than the metcash network IgA in the eastern states.
Customers in the south and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IgA stores are enjoying far greater market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - in SA, more than 30 per cent and 24 per cent in wa, compared with around 14 per cent in the eastern states.
Anyway, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believes that Aldi have the snares 5 per cent of the food market in those two States during the 12 months since the opening of the first shops that have taken sales from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
In its report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom kierath, estimated that the retailer IgA could lose $360 million in annual sales and metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West during the next year, it will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in different markets.
Loss of sales of the volumes of food and the fixed price basis metcash would have cost around $13 million on pre-tax income, said Mr kierath.
At the same time, metcash loses share of markets in the eastern states, especially to Aldi and Coles, although recent Roy Morgan research found that shopping in Iga were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that metcash food sales fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, with 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and its market share reduced from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by the year 2020.
Last week, a leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could be "highly likely to disappear within decades.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to the Douglass comment.
But it is known that a member of the Board of Directors of metcash Douglass contacted last week.
IgA's market share dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and earnings from the food trade, metcash, which supplies IgA, about 1,200 retailers fell by 43 percent from 2012, reflecting operational development changes, sales and revenue, because they are under pressure.
However, wholesale counterattacked and invest more than $150 million a year to supplement the regular price in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and helping IgA retailers again by adding to the rapidly growing stores of food and news from investors.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice, argues that programmes increasingly prices and retrofitting shops caught momentum and hopes that velkoprodej returns back to the basic profitable growth in profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit for his behaviour rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became collateral damage during the recent fuss around his friend Nick kyrgiose and deserves praise for his behavior, rather than criticism, the President of tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a junior member of the talented duo, often referred to as a "special KS," Drew unwelcome attention thanks to her affair with the infamous kyrgiosem and Stan wawrinkou at Montreal masters.
Soon after, in the heat of qualification match in Cincinnati, had to be his opponent, Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison after the referee had separated twice, Harrison said: "wawrinka had one stretch kyrgiosovi and I should reach out to him, too."
While he was last seen smashing a racket after he thwarted a possible defeat at the US Open, Richard gasqueta kokkinakise staunchly defended the Healy.
The young man is currently being held in Glasgow, where they compete with Sam Groth on the location in the second singles spot behind Bernard romicem in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I've been thinking about that, in my opinion, he was kinda dragged into the dispute, thanasi," notes Healy.
He destroyed his racket when he lost because of spasms in the US, but it's not the first player to have because of the frustration of himself took his anger out on his racquet thanasiho. I know very well, and I can say that this incident will not be proud of.
But I really was very good, because he was in the United States is exposed to very provocative facts about Harrison and so on, and so in my opinion, deserves great credit.
He's got a great team around him, he also has a great family around me, and I think that his treatment was a bit hard.
It's a very mature 19 year-old man, he works very hard, and the team is great and so on, never had a problem with the other players in the dressing room he's very respected, he trains hard, he's in great shape, it's a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged according to their own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook kyrgiose for an important match, which starts on Friday, and states that the "mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports a native of Canberra to return to the team as a long-term star.
"first of all, we want to make our team completely focused on the game and not at all the controversy around him [kyrgios] was formed," says Healy.
And I think Nick rose very quickly how Federer, Murray and others point out, in the eyes of the public is growing rapidly, have also made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight, when he would think about that, in my opinion, is the best solution for the team and for himself.
The European Migration Crisis: Hungary Declares State of emergency, closes borders and holding migrants
After the state of emergency announcement on Tuesday, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia and held off those who tried to have her illegal crossing to stop the tide of migrants.
On the border chaos, as hundreds of migrants piling up in no man's land, and the Serbian authorities have responded indignantly.
Those who are stuck at an unknown time on the strip of land between two States are those who are fleeing the violence in their native countries, tents and settling in.
But the feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter overhead, migrants call "open borders together!" and cursing a Hungarian police riot squad.
Some of the protest are refusing food and water.
The Serbian foreign minister, declared that it was "unacceptable" to the refugees were sent back from Hungary, while there are still more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, and not just the indirect harm.
During the next days will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest maďarsko-srbské border came a day after the block 28 states to come up with a coherent immigration policy on the ongoing meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to sharing responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in a surprised Italy and Greece and talked with the hope of achieving the eventual agreement next month or at the end of the year, which EU nations have accepted more than 120 000 other refugees, including Hungary.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special European Union summit next week to discuss the refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, their hope Junior ROTC at Brussels or his neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the road and speed up court cases dealing with asylum.
In the meantime, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania, to stop refugees who seek to transition through their country, if it's now completed a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News korepondent Charlie d'Agata reported that even prisoners have been on the list of those who helped put barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary became the main weakness, and an entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom fled from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted, however, that most of them are economic migrants, looking for a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, which is a view that is clearly different from that of the other EU States, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalised breaches of 4 a three-foot fence, which the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for a longer period in jail for those refugees illegal transfers.
"because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we have the clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, the Parliament must still approve the deployment of the army, which is expected in the next week, but associated press reporters on the border watching a heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for a few days.
Gyorgy bakondi, adviser to Orban for home defense, said that the Authority was caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and captured 15 already on the territory of the State.
With the damage to the fence, and are now in police custody, accused of committing offences under the new laws.
Authorities quickly left to fix the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after they used a tractor truck covered with barbed wire.
At the main border crossing at roszke was a mess, because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and crowds of people.
About 20 of them could be in the thousands, but remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, when they refused food and water until they're allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton ahead of Bernie Sanders was halved in the national vote
The former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders gaining on her head start.
Clinton now supports the 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether she will run for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competition, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are sure of the decision about which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more certain of their choice than those who support other candidates.
From a CBS News poll from last month, Clinton has lost ground on several demographic groups, while Sanders has several.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and improving, but its lead is narrowing.
Her support among men has reduced dramatically, and Sanders at her loses only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under 50 years evaporated and now are equal to Sanders.
Clinton still has a big lead thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double digit lead over Sanders among liberals, but now it is losing to Sanders in this group, only 5 points.
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 per cent would support it only for being a candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
I guess it's no surprise that are current přivrženci Clinton because of her particular passion.
Views are mixed between those that currently do not support Clinton -- only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same thing about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question, why do they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that he has the right experience (16 percent), followed by, that is, it's time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Supporters of Clinton also mentioned her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It also cited a big choice election and consensus on the issues.
While the Vice President is considering a potential candidacy for President, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would wish to face - a third thinks that she would not run for president.
When Democratic primary voters were asked whom they would have chosen as the second choice for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters claimed more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton will spread out of 20 points, while Biden will run, 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning in the general election; but this number dropped from 78 percent from last month.
Biden is on a scale far in the second, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely zvolitelného increases.
However, when it came to the question of greater importance, the Democratic candidate, voters prefer solutions to problems before a greater chance of being elected.
As of last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, they have good results in certain key characteristics among primary voters of his party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and he thinks they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden from all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same of Sanders (15 percent), but the 27 per cent it doesn't have this view.
Democratic primary voters also generally sees Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
For all those standards, about a quarter of democratic voters to Sanders has no opinion.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email account and server as Secretary of State continues, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of this matter, and they say that their overall view of the affect her at all.
But among the American public, it's a whole different story.
Half of Americans are dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on this topic were split in March, shortly after this problem came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, compared with 36 percent of their thoughts on Clinton.
It's all about the Republicans, where more than 6 in 10 say their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Despite the fact that Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy among voters her party, this question is still a problem among registered voters overall: just 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, which is down eight points from last month, and about 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters think he's honest and trustworthy.
And at the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested in honesty the best players were Biden, Carson and bush.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters just didn't do it.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson over Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest survey, the CBS News / New York Times
The two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest survey and others for their support.
Voters from the ranks of Republicans across the country continue to support Trump with an overwhelming majority, and climbed from 23% support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the debate on fox news last month, 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired in the same period from 6 to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson doing well across demographic groups, and excludes trump between univerzitně educated Republican voters.

The rising trend of Carson, Trump decided to fire blindly on the retired neurosurgeon, and even Carson apologized for questioning about Trump's faith.
"we need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity accused of the death of a first-year student Baruch College
Almost two years after a student died during přetěžovacího fraternal rituals in the pocono mountains in Pennsylvania, was filed murder charges against five men.
Brotherhood members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
The police stated that he was blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand, a total weight of 30 pounds, and he was repeatedly harassed, when trying to get to the target across frozen fields.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity called 911 immediately after he fainted, and Deng allegedly waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, the police said.
However, they have found the time to change clothes, Deng Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the National President of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, said police chief Chris - at a press conference.
"at this point, members began to hide equipment, and basically they preferred welfare fraternity before life Michael Deng," stated chief Wagner.
Unable to revive him and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck by blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"too many families were zdevastováno due to overloading in bratrstvích and at least one student is dying every year because of hazing since 1970," says Douglas fierberg, an attorney representing the family, dengue, in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must responsibility and this is an important step on the part of the authorities.
Monroe County grand jury has recommended charges of murder in the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault, conspiracy and coming back.
"we want to hold not only the parties involved, but in the event that there is an organisation, which approved it, whether officially or unofficially, shunting of responsibility too," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and national fraternity revoked its relationship with local branches.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
Growth rates will come and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy slides into recession.
All this we know.
What we don't know is how much time it would take and how long it will take.
For the economy, in particular, offers a little history on the timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, though not always, decisive in how the economy and financial assets to respond.
This is the reason why the U.S. Central bank officials have stressed that investors would not be focused on when it will start raising rates, but rather the trajectory, how long will it take to standardisation.
The game is actually more variables.
In the end, however, may be members of the market to make sure that all the fuss because of an increase in speed may be exaggerated.
"the Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as' the end of an era of cheap money, '" he said in a note for clients Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we don't anticipate that a gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low, creates a seismic shock, which many fear might be.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here's a look at how they react to certain areas of the economy, on the basis of historical trends:
Given what the market has come in the last month, by May the expected rate hikes to make the air a little bit unstable.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"it seems that there is a trend for the suspension of the shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which perhaps reflects the time lag in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study about what happens after the Fed ’ s increase.
More specifically, the market for the last 35 years most often - about 14 per cent - Heading to increase rates in relatively flat in 250 days (the average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returned to normal after a period of five days, with the average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis of Bob dolla, chief equity strategist of Nuveen asset management, published in Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the stock tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rate increases and the return of beginning to decline.
The recession is a fact of economic life, but the increase in rates often help her.
Currently, the Fed is faced with certain conditions that do not yet exist, and which could hasten a recession.
The most remarkable is that the gross domestic product, close to its lowest point in the history of the Fed ’ s interest rate increase.
According to the Deutsche Bank was in 118 rate hikes since 1950 only twice a year on year increase in nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few expect him to maintain, when, in the third quarter was only 1.5 percent, the Atlanta fed.
Rate hikes in this difficult economic background could be risky and might occur, "the question of whether this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market participants were ready for the Fed ’ s growth all year and all eyes turned to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which was held this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that at this meeting, the FOMC could approve the increase, future trading indicates only 25procentní probability.
"in our study since 1950 were all zvyšovací cycles so far in the great cycle of increasing leverage with the recession GDP peak very soon after the beginning of the recovery," it says in the report.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sample period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of these, when the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we're on 74 months and still continue.
Fixed income was also volatile, because the market is expecting a rate hike and the model is somewhat similar to what they're experiencing shares.
The main difference is that the effect is more pronounced in bonds than shares, when the Fed will change the direction of policy.
For bonds, it appears that the proceeds are changing direction immediately after the arrival of the first cycle of increase / decrease.
At the end of a cycle of increasing bond yields fall immediately, "said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the increase in rates will cause approach yields between long- and krátce-datovanými bonds, which matched the curve.
High-yield bonds often in this climate, they work better, though, "we're still cautious about tightening yield," it stated in its analysis, Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab.
What's interesting is that Jones thinks that the markets are no longer adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that prospects for the market to adapt to tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, businesses which carry out most of their business in the US, win for an increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will be worse, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the area of the world market and their debt will also be larger.
"history shows that" quality "shares tend to overcome during the three months after the initial rate increase," said analysts at Goldman sachsve in a report to clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets ahead of the company ’ s weak balance sheet in any increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004, an average of about 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also overcome their counterparts lower quality (an average of 4 percentage points) or 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of variable interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Out of pure equity plays benefit consumers also thanks to the US dollar.
Savers may also see their profits through higher yields, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "fertilizer"
Takes the view that it's increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rivals
Also focused on the BBC Music Awards, and he says that the British simply cheat
A parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked voice and says he is not even original idea
BBC Radio 3 to "changes" in the classic FM, claims a leading parliamentarian and piling fresh pressure on the broadcasters to show that they're doing something that commercial broadcasters don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said BBC bosses, the public service radio station that seems to be "ohlupována" and is increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rivals.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word" ohlupováno "- but he seems to be turning into classic FM," he said.
Also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December of last year.
The BBC music awards, which began in the last year, seems to be the British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to mind, when in fact it only simulating what we already have on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
The Director General of the BBC, denied the charges on the grounds that the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival, in terms of live music and public education.
That's what I've learned about classical music on Radio 3 would be to any other radio station.
And their commitment to live music and making music is, in fact, at the top level.
"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and marketing to new works into the operation, it is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, argued the BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey, it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before, because the British are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was the only element of the output of the BBC, which came under fire for stepping on the foot of commercial competitors during the broadcast of the Culture, Media and Sport, and they got to a hearing of the Commission.
The Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked the musical talent show "The Voice" - which the BBC bought from a Dutch producer Talpa media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
You can see why this programme is discussed as non-original and not especially different?
Lord hall insisted that BBC one show in September - which stars Paloma faith aboy George as judges - was made "in a manner typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the corporation to "find a hit of his own" when's next start entertaining series.
However, refused to rule out ordering more future seasons of the show the voice or spending taxpayers ’ money in royalties to other entertainment formats.

Multiple sclerosis: it's not just the drugs but also on the will of the patient to fight.
Ms is a complex disease and the person with the diagnosis of needs care of a number of experts: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, therapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
It ’ s not just about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultation, even if they decide to have a child, to care for these sick include social advice, recommendations on housing arrangements, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient.
The more actively to fight the disease, the longer it can work and does not fundamentally change the style of his life.
Indeed, as doctors point out, the passivity of the sick for the activity of the disease.
It is, for example, demonstrated that exercise significantly delaying the time when sick needs some compensatory aid such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their families subjected to various myths, such as that the disease is automatically leads to end up in a wheelchair.
And that's page have a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign, give yourself a chance.
The most important person in the care of patients with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis pays twice the adage that the disease starts to treat the sooner, the better, your doctor may make a difference.
It's because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when it is not yet a process neuro-degeneration, so strong.
The earlier we intervene, the greater the hope is that we can stop the illness and delay the debilitating, explains Dr. Eva honey from the neurological clinic of the general University Hospital in Prague.
It's very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitative care, which most often addresses the weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
With the sick to work according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthening the pelvic floor, mitigate swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.
"it's very individual, depending on the specific problems of the patient," says Dr. Martin kövári, the chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis may indeed suffer from the same disease, but each has a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation can't stop the illness, but always can alleviate her symptoms.
Physical activity also stimulates the immune status of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another encouraging sign of regular exercise is the fact that you are sick, what can handle everything, and it builds their confidence.
"the exercise also releases endorphins, wash and they make you feel good," says Pavel Camilla řasová of rehabilitation medicine at the University Hospital of Vinohrady.
The physical side of our relationship, we operate on the limbic system, responsible for emotions.
Right so we intervene in psyche even immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"previously, these patients are saved, we now know that they need a targeted burden," says prof J.R. Pavel Kolar, the head of the clinic for the rehabilitation and physical medicine, University Hospital in Motol.
Physical therapy is in order to be self-sufficient as long as possible, including the post.
That's why working with physiotherapists ergoterapeuty for every person in the world to get compensatory aid him at the Garden of Peace.
Many of the patients needs and the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When it comes to the life of a serious illness, most people can see this.
They're experiencing shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to a major burden - the loss of health.
With such aching souls have gone to someone, not to try to take everything on his shoulders.
"I work with them, so that it finally came to the conclusion that, even with a handicap you can live a full life and multiple sclerosis, that doesn't mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata raspberry - Schubert from the neurological clinic of the general University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague latecoere manufacturer Airbus would not fly.
Aircraft production is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technologies.
The new planes are full of titanium or lightweight and rigid composite materials, which are now so someone can't make and process.
Still, it's next to superpřesných, computerized machine tools, beside the autoclaves for shaping the composites hit on something so mundane, such as apricot seeds.
In the drum, which resembles a pot candy, in a pile of stones to espouse the edges of metal parts that just came out of the frézovacího machines.
"no one has yet come up with anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of the manufacturer of air door latecoere Czech Republic.
On the premises in a Prague Vystaviste produces earlier Letov complete the door to Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world, supplying the door for Brazil ’ s Embraer 170.
The door, part of which will be drawn up in Prague, also come in first and upper class passengers on the upper decks of the world's largest airliner, the Airbus A380.
They're installed here the door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the motto here.
Seeds need keys leaves the company adjusted twice a year.
If the yellow sticker missed the record, they should be in a race to explain what auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who rides regularly to check if the doors are produced according to agreed rules.
Human senses but advanced technology not yet completely replaced.
On one door to the A320 is 1500 rivets.
You must manually nýtaři man.
It takes them two days ago.
Even the sound of hammers to see if it's properly rivet flustered.
Tolerance, in which they move, it is the minimum.
Rivet above the surface of the aircraft can go from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
When it comes to a number of trained touch.
When the controller slides his finger along the line of rivets, it knows if one is out of tolerance.
Until then, she will pick up the exact úchylkoměr.
Letov fed before 1989 L-39 training programme for military aircraft.
But in 1991 he made neither one.
The firm had to quickly find a new contract.
Back then, together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for the supplier of the emergency door for the A321 model.
Courtship with Boeing were not so lucky.
"we were only a small company, which did not have enough money for investment and to Boeing can guarantee long-term stable supply," recalls the outcome.
The door to the American manufacturers would remain closed if Letov in 1999 delivered at the Prague Conference of the International Association of French aerospace group latecoere.
I was talking about our collaboration with Airbus.
The next day it started negotiations with the French, says the outcome.
A year later, the Czech firm latecoere bought companies and with a new contract.
In the year 2000 to start assembly of parts of the doors for the A320.
Three years later, the door on the upper deck of the A380.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for processing composites for the delivery for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without latecoere ourselves to these big contracts.
Maybe we'd be doing small parts or components.
The partners want guarantees of supply for twenty or thirty years, explains the outcome.
Last year, the Czech latecoere reached over 2.9 billion turnover and profit after tax 147 million kronor.
An exclusive position between suppliers and aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague since 2000 has invested 1.5 billion crowns.
The company must have certificates of quality, certification, 170 special manufacturing processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them the company would make no door to the aircraft.
To obtain the certificates, that manufacturing processes meet customer requirements, and multiple checks to keep costs under voyage million crowns.
The production processes changed every year.
They are more accurate and more stringent.
We have the staff, equipment and doškolovat dovybavovat again the process to certify the outcome, he adds.
Now the firm is finalising the preparation process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the existing human harmful cadmium.
The award was received from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology for equipment or chemicals, which are used in Prague.
People come from Boeing, will test the concept of the entire service.
Then we make them.
Also check out our laboratory.
One set of samples to test themselves in his lab and then compare the results with the outcome, the way in which it's controlled by customers.
They are rewarded with the Prague firm long-term exclusive contracts.
The race is now with the Prague and falling production embraerů.
For the A320 family generates half of the total volume of the door.
Replace the Czech latecoere is for the Brazilian or European producer either impossible, or very difficult.
That does not mean, however, that the door might say at any cost.
Part of the contract's price curve.
This indicates how many doors will happen after ten, fifty, hundred of pieces produced.
The price for a piece of falling to a specific limit value.
Into this price formula, we need to go in.
If not, we'll lose money, says the outcome.
Half of the lobby, where they assembled at the electrical closet for military Airbus a400 m, is still empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, there is building new polorobotická line on the riveting and fitting doors for an innovative model of the A320 Neo.
The riveting speed and precise.
"this is the trend, which the assembly in aviation is going," adds the outcome.
Sales of the future has been secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 units of the new model of the A320.
Just a couple of yards off line for a complete assembly of the door for the upper deck of the A380.
It's a strategic decision our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production and lower costs.
The full assembly could begin within two years, says the outcome.
However, the company must go through before qualification tests needed for the assembly of certain electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is betting on further developing the production of composite materials.
In addition to the Boeing should also take part in the new Airbus A350, which will compete with the Dreamliner.
"for a company that's huge credit, when they can also process the metal materials and composites," he says proudly, the outcome.
Latecoere, however, in the Czech Republic is on the edge of the production capacity.
In the area of Letov, where another place is not.
Prior to the entry of the French company's 180 employees.
Now has 800 and within three years there could be a hundred more.
So long as Airbus and Boeing compete to see how many of the hundreds of new aircraft, the airline every year, they order may not have a job.
Although he has a contract for several years, the parent company of the Prague latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group should have enough money for the September loan repayments.
In the end, she could deal with major creditors latecoere.
At the end of August, a proportion of the loans for shares traded.
Creditors in the company of a capital increase to €57.4 million share of 37.4 percent.
The company's debt has fallen by two thirds, that is about EUR 180 million.
The second part of the recovery of the financial system came at the beginning of September.
The company has subscribed to the new shares to existing shareholders 222,9 million euro.
She raised a total capital of EUR 280 million.
However, the group benefited from the increasing production of the Airbus and Boeing, who are involved in sales, 85 percent.
The average expected growth of about four percent per year until 2017.
In the custom book has orders for €2.6 billion, which is equivalent to a four-year production.
French Media claims that latecoere, finally, after years in the VA can breathe again.
In Prague, the Czech race Vystaviste is significant for the group.
It contributes to the revenue of the group of 16 percent.
According to the number of employees is the largest foreign branch of the group.
The deputies supported a greater share of State charges for coal.
The change in charges for the extraction of minerals is to bring to the Treasury about 427 million kroner more than in 2013.
Revenue for the municipal government has to have a neutral impact, because the fee is to be higher.
In the year of the fees received from roughly 450 million kroner and the State budget of 150 million kronor.
From brown coal mining was about $200 million for municipalities and State 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in payments from the mining space to the mining for 1,000 kronor per hectare per year.
The revenue from these charges is still in its entirety belong to municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) members said that the municipalities that gain a year instead of the 14 million to 100 million kroner.
The amount of mining fees won't be determined by law, but her set by government decree.
The payment will be calculated by multiplying the number of newly harvested the mineral and rates for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, is the reason for the amendment, among other things, the possibility of flexible reactions to the current economic situation.
MP ODS Marek Benda but warned that setting the fee by government may not be in line with the Constitution.
According to the Minister, but the doctor isn't in this case because the State tax levied on mineral, which is state property.
The fees, receive only municipalities, whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep-sea mining coal will get three quarters of the money municipalities and a quarter of the State.
The same ratio will also be the case for the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money, which the State mining royalties will be ring-fenced.
For example, 28 percent will have to go on damage control, after logging, mining or to provide emergency services.
A draft today criticised the opposition MPs who claimed, in particular, that the municipalities affected by the mining region.
For example a (TOP 09 and mayors) warned that mining companies no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they pay higher fees directly into the State budget.
"it is not possible to tunnel in one of the poorest regions, because the Minister of Finance to improve budget," said David Kádner (dawn) elected in Ústí.
Before the surge in unemployment pro MP warned KSČM Han aulická.
Kádner aulická unsuccessfully proposed amendments and rejected, he wanted to go back to the government the Škoda completion.
In the explanatory memorandum is that, according to the mining companies to increase fees reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent of the contracted in the long term.
The main consumers such as power plants or CHP should therefore not feel price growth.
"on the other hand, however, this increases the risk that mining companies will be compensated for the increase of efforts to reduce its operating expenses, which primarily means reducing the number of employees," says the government.
It is, however, an increase in fees from the point of view of employment.
According to the rapporteur, to the novel by Milan Urbana (ČSSD) is the key to members before the approval of the law knew the conclusions on the updated Energy Concept, and especially the government's decision about the limits on coal mining.
If coal will also benefit the limits, then it will have implications for the proceeds for the State and municipalities, he pointed out.
Urban disagrees with Mládek, in that the decision of the breaking down of the Czechoslovak army should fall until after 2020.
The limits of the CSA down, he says, should break it for social reasons, and because of the long term stability of the domestic energy sector.
The time for a decision on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The whole world is watching how the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision about whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists contacted by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve will take the decisions, now thinks it will stay dormant for some time and keep interest rates in the range of 0-0,25 percent.
It's a historic event, because he passed years from when the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, the closer we get to a situation where the central bank might be able to get out of the bar to zero, and to start the process of normalizing interest rates, "says Angel ubide, manager at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The American economy has performed relatively well, there has been a recovery in terms of adding trillions of dollars to the State, and only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less pink global perspective.
Markets have been warned to be prepared for an increase, but circumstances suggest that it also sees a big chance against that step.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday at 20: 00 CET.
The shooter left a note, Delta State University
Shannon Lamb, who on Monday had shot his girlfriend in Mississippi - and later the same day, even your colleague - he wrote a message in which he says he's "Sorry" the first murder and he wishes he could take it back, revealed on Tuesday, and government agencies.
Police in gautieru in Mississippi stated that lamb, a geography teacher and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police at about ten o'clock Monday morning.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send police to his house.
He said: "last night, I shot my wife," and also mentioned that the house is “cute dog, ” which“ will not bother anybody ”, but he's upset.
The police demanded the names of the caller, but lamb is introduced.
Lamb also explained why the shots were fired in the house.
When the police arrived on the scene, found the body 41leté Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb, who said: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me. ”
After leaving a message with the lamb walked 300 miles long journey to college Delta, where a history teacher killed Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
The Dean of the University's William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but that "in Mr Lamb's head, apparently there was something going on. ”
Despite the Monday announcement about lamb allegedly believed in a romantic relationship with Amy Prentiss Schmidt government authorities argue that a “love triangle ” there is“ no evidence ”.
Shawn O ’ Steen, who had been married for over seven years with Prentiss said that it was "a great person".
The divorce was 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
A 19-year-old daughter o Steen and Prentiss case was “shaken up ”.
O ’ Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were “best friends ”.
According to Lindsay Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as stated by the sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named bolt, she went with the lamb for about three years.
"she always wanted to help others, ” she Knowles.
The police stated that lamb on Monday spoke to his relatives and said, "he's going to jail".
When police caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later the same night, lamb stopped and ran off into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to a biography posted on the website of the school lamb, earned a PhD in education at the University of delta in the spring of 2015.
Stars who lost their mojo
The actor (left), on the slide with his son Redmond (right), has had a stressful few years.
In 2001, he fought with leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and, in 2008, he was arrested for drug possession.
All of these things can of course choose their tax.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months out of the game for a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left in tears, and it's an injury that knocked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks that Shaw could be playing again at the end of the season.
Injuries caused by reckless intervention - Moreno in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw pushed his way into the area of PSF.
Nine minutes and was treated on the field and was also needed an oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "he suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
He'll be taken tomorrow or maybe the next day and then further surgery in Manchester.
It's terrible - the boy who comes to Manchester in 18 years, it's very hard, but he's playing fantastic, and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he was also wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of therapy and wouldn't be able to play in the group stage.
I believe that he will play again this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli Mexican punished.
Van gall, indicated that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for themselves whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly surgery on both legs.
A tweet from the account, Shaw says: "thank you everyone for all their news," words cannot express how I ruined my road to recovery begins now and come back even stronger. "
Related: Manchester United's Luke Shaw recorded injuries in the defeat against PSV
English defender will have added motivation to recovery in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip coke, coach of PSV, he said: "it was a very nasty wound."
If any player leaving the field with an injury like this, everybody is very sad.
It's never the aim of our players to hurt the opposition.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a game for Mexico against van Gaal's Holland at the World Cup in 2014.
"it's very difficult for him, because his intention was not to hurt opposing players, and when you hear about the severity of that injury, it's not good," said coke.
I wasn't able to see this moment.
I just saw the ball, who was heading in the other direction, so it seemed that touched him [Moreno], but I haven't seen surgery on Luke.
In an interview for the sbs6 Moreno stated: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult it can be such a thing.
I feel very badly, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés saved was also rushed to hospital after Chris smallinga.
David Cameron certainly knows the Lorax better?
This thing every parent knows: when you fall in love with a book, it doesn't take long before you'll teach her almost by heart.
However, this must not be David Cameron.
The children's drawings, the service providers to name a favorite childhood book, chose the Prime Minister the Lorax, a Dr Seuss story from 1971.
It was hard to choose, says Cameron in a report published on the website of the company supercamps and continues: "funny, touching, creative and with strong content, so I like to read to their children, because it was always the image or message, which I haven't seen before."
Well, except that in the following paragraph Cameron allegedly described the book as the lift from the film of 2012, added more characters and details, filed a brief on the original text.
"in the city, walled thneed-ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by complying with her wishes to see a real tree," is a summary of the content of the book, which is the object of love unknown, Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that alone wasn't enough suspicious text delivered Cameron reads like a summary of the film the Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "in the city, walled thneed-ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would meet with the plot of the book, where the unnamed young man knows that greed is destroying the wildlife, trees, removing industrialista Once-ler, who despite the protests, the cover loraxe crouched, mustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, so relatively few significant PR challenge got a sidekick, who never read the Lorax child 20 times in a row.
A spokesman for Downing Street indicated that the text probably came from the office of Cameron.
Supercamps confirmed that the text has provided an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam lyth was in danger, but the omission of England still holds
Compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team that England selected for this tour, it will be under me repeating 3-0 defeat suffered the last time in a test series, not very likely.
I would also not rule out directly to win customers.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup, and also the collective thinking is strong; bear the scars of 2012, only a youthful positivity.
With the ball, moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and emerging spinner, although it is unknown to level the test series, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam lyth fell out of the England team experienced in the series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
Decision to omit Adam lytha for me is hard to analyse, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests was against two good attacks in demanding conditions, and simple, but the harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, about the name Joe root, there were no question marks, which led to the announcement, because — and this I've already stated previously — players are their best'but.
A few other half-century and lyth could extend his streak, but he had control over its own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, it's another opportunity.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position even though his performances were not quite 100 percent, and I'm not surprised; he's always been a team player.
The question of how much time he gets test batsman, to show he is a tough nut to crack.
Lyth got seven caps — as well as Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance at home and abroad.
The only thing about which you might gripe, is that England did in the Caribbean first chance Jonathan trottovi — though lyth was in the best form — but this wasted opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales comes in and it's a batsman, whom I rate very positively.
It's x-faktorový cricketer we've seen here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when we get on the field against 236 Trent Bridge, which made it a little bit.
He must at least be afforded the same opportunity, one given to his predecessors, but all this will of course depend on the overall lineup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, when moeen begins alongside cook, which would have got the extra spinner while retaining four quicks were raised, and I have no reservations against it.
I don't understand why strokemaker cannot hit left-handed and this man has already demonstrated that he is a great cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to get their work done for his county, Worcestershire, but he was the number 3 and a big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played their first 38 tests before his performance in 2001.
He immediately have accomplished three centuries and never looked back.
The team comes as a back-up spinner Zafar Ansari and when I had the chance to follow him, impress me as a very impressive young man.
People can watch his crude statistics — an average of 31 to 35 with the bat and ball — and I see it as a ferry, but not a lot of spinnerů who raised their hands, and selektoři opted for youth.
There's a lot of that on this tour.
Outside the team, it appears that England made a few changes and a smart addition to their coaching staff.
The appointment of batsman mahela jayawardenea, from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches can be a master stroke.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who bring rich experiences that have experience with all the conditions and all of the attacks.
Paul Collingwood is in part a white-ball tour and will bring energy to the team as a ruthless edge.
I always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and as mahela has intellect, which can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they're consistent voices saying things that have been said before, they may occasionally lighten and freshen up the atmosphere.
Durham teammate Ben Stokes collyho got the day off, as well as root received a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this Decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and generate selektoři timetable.
And you have to remember, as the players that their job depends on results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
Brexit campaign could win by 2017, if the economy starts to stagnate.
Half-baked David Cameron's renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with every day that passes without the election of Jeremy's genius "is that a yes or a no?" Corbyn to the head of the Labour Party, or the TUC on Tuesday to take up the whole situation around Europe.
Foreigners are also his corbyna and Nigel faragese.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained, as Europe is mired in various crises - not all of which are their own fault - some Member States already have enough British egocentric agenda, dividing concessions and disruptive changes to the Treaty, which mostly didn't want.
At its Annual Meeting in Brighton with the TUC have decided they don't want it even if the eroding social protection.
We could even call it a selfie agenda Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor goes to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, they take a picture in front of the famous local monument, with or without the local dignitaries, and then returned home with the words that win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to wear nezahleděnou Britain in European Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some myopic ministers and officials in some major cities to get to a point where we left them on the matter.
Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, is carefully balanced ally, but has been in power for 10 years and he wants to leave his post, before it becomes wrong, as it has for too long, continuous Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand and Kohl (14) (16).
The Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
Also, his power is waning.
Poland may soon have the nationalist government on the right hand side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how the selfie to help break the legs of the British people who could better invest your energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want to, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately unhelpful remarks style SNP during the referendum campaign in 2017 the UK to accelerate the process of Brexit, says a friend.
"the renegotiation solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value from the negotiations."
The Europeans to their own detriment, they know how predatory he can be in Fleet Street, and how the EU are skeptical of the press barons, oligarchs, because they weren't inspired by Tony Benn during the referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in a ratio of 2: 1.
You may vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, dishonest euro-oportunistu, who made his name as a Brussels correspondent "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his vanity Ed Miliband knew its enemies.
Include a mixture of taxes, non-payment of rogues, strangers hackujících phones and pseudo nezámořské departments, which owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, about Tony Blair thought the same thing, but he realized that when you're in a cage with violent gorilla, she must throw bananas, to give you to dinner and then also to tea.
In fact, it was Miliband more like Blair than Blair himself, when he said Cameron ’ s referendové routine, since Blair accepted principle in the EU Constitution repealed, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned his card.
The press never forgave him, too.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who on Monday in Westminster a friendly pat on the back - I told him that he must not waste time on me - seems to be in danger of accepting our strategy to boycott Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy involving the media, not me, but I'm sure with Andrew Marr, whose chair at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin official attitude towards Europe, to put it mildly, is developing.
Claims that he wanted to stay in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the rabid UKIP tendencies and wild shores of Tory's little englanderismu may accede to it I'm sure.
It's the same thing, "said Hilary bemm but no benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner boy scout couldn't bring herself to admit that appointing corbynovo abrazivního McDonnell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father fought on TV about his allegiance, without going too far and lost his job.
The game Hillary was much more attractive.
But the fight for us to stay "in all circumstances" - bennina phrase - apparently it wasn't, what McDonnell did or what JC said colleagues and members on their private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the background, sensitive image that Corbyn wants to communicate - don't forget, he touched me - Discipline Reports remains important in broadcasting all day long and particularly in faith, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal of social media
Is it fair for Cameron not to provide a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the labor party in referendové campaign for granted, as noted by McDonnell.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But mcdonnellovo and corbynovo basic equivocation about membership of the EU - in accordance with their Bennite anti-kapitalistickou besieging the economy in the past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion between leftist dissidents, for which it is the narcissism of small differences, the central principle of the doctrinal bickering.
Just like with his rationalization about NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that it doesn't want to terminate the campaign JC - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their own masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin to spend political capital - are also suspicious voters - concessions for Britain when it seems pointless.
The United States are already quite disappointed from the British "weak military power in Iraq, Libya and Syria, and that even with cost cutting, a conservative government in power, as I was reminded on Monday night the start of something, what was the name of the Security Forum of British influence.
Experts criticized the review on electronic published by public health England
A statement by the government funded agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking, came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links with the tobacco industry, the researchers argue.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet review of the evidence in their report on electronic cigarettes by public health England (Phe).
The Agency has published "mezníkovou" Phe report last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
But a few researchers questioned the robustness of the data and draw attention to the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in The Lancet last month, attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy base", on which the Agency Phe based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ, disputed the claim, which was supposedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "the fundamental principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of efficacy."
They indicate that the general public might expect, that's a statement of the Agency, "Phe, the current best estimate is that the e-cig are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one of the 12 people meeting convened to develop multi-kritéria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their views on damages associated with the different products containing nicotine; the results were summarized in a research report.
McKee and capewell points out that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called euroswiss health whose CEO reportedly has previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent study.
Also endorsed the credentials of public health, bat in the sustainability report, States.
One of 12 participants in the meeting said the funding from the makers of electronic cigarettes, but no financing, which reportedly earned previously from a tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for the selection of members of the panel is not available, but it contains several known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of whom also claim in the paper industry funding.
Some of the others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
Phe also attended the meeting in tobacco control.
The report arising in this group, "admits" missing "hard evidence of harm of most products on most of the criteria," wrote McKee and capewell.
However, none of these references or restriction is not described in the Phe report.
McKee and capewell said Phe claims that "so far, there is no evidence that the e-cig acted as a path to smoking for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at phe, said that the allegations in the BMJ have been answered before.
He said: "electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the public health risk posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
Phe has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and what not, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative risk compared with tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die from diseases related to smoking and smoking cost the NHS £2 billion a year.
A clear emphasis on current evidence - that even if the e-cig is not without risk, carry only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fill our national competence.
The BBC should end up with EastEnders, says former director of Channel 4
A former director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as Eastenders and the voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would give their right arm "for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programmes which are not made of other British television.
BBC criticised for her public service programmes, which will likely see only a handful of people, in complex times, compared with its rivals "biggest rating show, and on channels such as bbc4.
After Director General Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said, he was trying without success to keep in touch with the BBC for six years, which worked on Channel 4.
"I struggle with the idea that the BBC and broadcasting programmes that would surely have been broadcast rivals without the contributions of the state," Johnson said in the Commission for the communication in the upper house, as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you can keep your licence fees, which I'm not sure whether they are in the medium or long term is a good idea, should reduce the production of at least as regards programmes, which do not produce or other.
The voice broadcast in prime time, because they want to gain the widest possible support in the future.
The idea that no one else would have him, it's a funny joke, and, of course, absurd.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programmes, which may be financed by bezpříspěvkově.
The voice is one of them, EastEnders next, and, of course, produced on home soil.
Frankly, other channels would still be right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting service.
I don't think it would in no way undermine the BBC.
Johnson, a businessman in the field shows that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he feels guilty that he drove ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the most popular show the BBC repeats that the former executive director of the sky, Tony ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC will sell a show like EastEnders.
Johnson said that even hýčkanější public service programmes the BBC "passes on bbc4, where quite often cannot be measured audience, but its power and can argue when they embark on their mission of false justification for £4BN income from royalties," but of course we're making all these obscure programmes, to which no one is looking. "
It is broadcast at a time when no one's looking at them.
As for the licence fee to the Commission, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find regresivnější system about who gets the best value out of him.
Of course we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people for whom £150 is a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look so much at the BBC.
The former director of the sky and Channel 5, David elstein, who spoke before the Commission on Tuesday, he said that the BBC should revise their reithovskou mission in the sense of "inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that the BBC was now a small volume of production has previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take as a model public public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, explain and talk."
On the partnership elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms, which was aired on television only a handful, and make contact with commercial reporters, so we all can see online.
“sonogenetika ’ or controlling brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound pulses influence the direction in which the nematodes.
Scientists bred worms with genetically modified the nervous system, which can control the sound waves.
Tiny nematodes changing direction at a time when they are affected by sound pulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses are working so that they switch cells genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists have argued that these worms are a perfect example of the new methodology called sonogenetika, which uses ultrasound to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells and activate cells outside the body.
Sreekanth chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, explained to the guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure, in which a patient's brain electrodes that stimulate the brain lymphoma-specific. Such method is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson ’ s disease.
Nematodes usually do not respond to an ultrasound, but chalasani found that the reaction will be when it is placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
Find out how bubbles are compounded by ultrasonic waves, which then passes through the body of the worms.
Enhanced ultrasound waves operate in trp-4 ion channels, which are located in the membranes of certain cells of the worms.
He used sound waves to these channels open and activate cells to which they are linked, according to a report in the journal Nature communications.
To control nematodes using ultrasonic waves, chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain trp-4 ion channels.
Then, when he used the modified worms ultrasound, the sound waves were strengthened mikrobublinami and transferred to the worms, where on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is much like optogenetice, groundbreaking tools, which allow scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
But chalasani, sonogenetika could have compared to many of the benefits of this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent to the optical fibre to the desired location in the brain may ultrasonic waves to penetrate tissues without limit and be sent directly into the brain.
"we believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses that can target the human neurons and make them susceptible to temporarily ultrasonic signals used in the clinical treatment of the treatment of neurological diseases," says chalasani.
He added that his method would be found in the treatment of muscle cells and the cells that produce insulin.

Ads embarrassing British arms deal.
Look at the video about protizbraňovém market from Amnesty International.
A fearsome killer drones.
The shackles on his legs, broken ankles!
High-explosive rounds.
And electric stun batons, which causes excruciating pain, but they leave no trace.
A cheerful voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fairs, is a sharp parody created for amnesty international to highlight the willingness of the British government selling arms to repressive regimes across the defence and security equipment International jamborees in the Excel centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also being conducted with a year of posters at bus stops and the meters, which require a second look.
"important notice, travel on the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" read one, using a font with the brands of the London underground and DLR lines becomes an image of a tank.
In September this year will be the arms dealers descend on the DLR... customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
About 300 posters are created by artists who are displaying their work in a museum of design in Banksy's cruel dismalandu.
The collective name of the Special Patrol Group is helping distribute throughout London and using the "ad space hack packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen keys, who allegedly "can gain access to approximately a third of bus stops advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flypostingovým "vandalism."
One of the ad parody produced a collective Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin, curator grindona cruel designs and an assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly challenging and trying to show the political activity of the audience outside the gallery.
A lot of artists to work with activists in the protest movement, and they realize that needs to get out in the real world, in order to have their art, the impact on the company.
Another one of the posters against the arms trade on the health of the passengers on the subway.

Eight golden rules for student life on campus
11 years ago I moved to student housing as a 19-year-old oblivious, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but, until now, I recall a tense smiles of those whom I resented - and multiple, lengthy complaints on the other.
Everything I have learned can be distilled down to eight simple rules.
Moving on to the rails can range from a slightly irritating to totally appalling.
It's tempting to babbling: tell people where you're from, if you take a year off, what's your opinion on corbyna and why "honestly you don't love or hate Marmite, not just for people, it's just the yeast extract, hahaha, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe, too - ask questions and show interest.
It manages the conversation and help you to find the people you love, and those with whom you would be fun even if your eyelashes were on fire and they're making a fire extinguisher.
Give people space.
Room people often change drinking at reception, places, film nights and municipal public places, but they're also the room where people dress up and adjusting their underwear.
Related: don't even think about it, you think you started college and be in a relationship
Introverts in college are very short.
Your room should be a haven, but a lot of the tracks on the changing mimopokojovou culture, which is a friendly, outgoing and contributes to a lifelong friendship.
It can be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture permits you to say, "I love you and I want to continue our friendship, but I need you to leave, so I can get back to the energy I had used to talk with you."
Try to know when a classmate's tired of socialization - and maybe write him a knock.
Speaking of: knock knock.
One kid in my dorm had a habit of that, if the doors are locked, it's invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with baking.
Because you started going to university at the top of baking mania, knock on doors and play with plate upečenými cakes seems slightly less awkward, less than "welcome to the neighbourhood, I've made you, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering home-cooked treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe it will come out, so that your face is assigned to the succulent surprises.
It is, of course, the fact that you are a decent Baker.
Wrong condensed pieces of flour, sugar and jams that will probably lead the others pretend to sleep, if you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is common on college campuses.
The theft of the whole chicken, of course, is a crime, but it's a little bit of milk to your tea theft?
Check it twice with the owner of the milk.
There is a chance that you will offer milk when they go inside.
If someone steals something, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little bit more mature than my roommate, who swapped my milk in the dishwashing liquid to punish thieves.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't make noise that distracts people from their sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you are also known for people in glass houses.
A girl from my hall asked his neighbors if he could keep it down, drum and bass because there were 3 in the night and in the morning she had a test.
Their answer was to amplify the music.
When it finally fell silent at 5 o'clock in the morning, let them sleep for two hours and then let out loud his own music, locked the door and left on his three-hour exam.
It would be romantic if your future husband went to the same college as you?
And on the contrary, it would be awfully embarrassing if you mistook the roommate for his future wife, slept together, split up and they had to see each other every day, and it might also take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants - but if your roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try to talk to at least a little bit with his groin.
In the afternoon, the moment when you realize that someone had left the keys in their unlocked room, there's a fine line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable lesson about their security and the entertainment that they can never hide anything - don't ruin someone's room and toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door for them and give them the keys to the bottle of water, which was then put in the freezer - but they do not stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva is looking forward to the twins, even in the face of an uncertain future.
Eve's been through some rough times already during pregnancy with seven-year-old vítkem today.
His father broke up with her, and to prepare for and raising the child alone.
I've dealt with the situation relatively quickly - so I'm looking forward to the baby and I was looking at the positives.
The uncertainty and the fact that I'm a child myself, I'm trying not to.
And I'm sure I had a hope, that we are not alone, says Eva today for their first pregnancy.
Then she met on the Internet in a chat room and a senior, who had started to talk about popular movies.
Vasek Eva with vítkem even brought him home from the hospital, but in the role of my stepfather was too hasty.
"for a time, then pulled out of the programme," she described Eva in the documentary series four at the 3.
A third series of Czech TV series is just the pursuit of happiness at the second attempt.
Care about the financial security of families did so thanks to a part-time job, and a big bailout to help moms and aunts.
Not even the prospect of responsibility for someone else's child eventually Vaska's affection for Eva spoil.
Definitely got together around vítkových second birthday and he now sees as his father and Vasek also address him as such.
Although he has two adult daughters Vasek, fatherhood in sixty according to their words used and children are also more.
Besides Vitek added another two years and I'm finally even twins.
"true to our family into the kind of naturally, perhaps even by my mother in the relationships didn't talk much," he thinks the smiling Eva.
Few places?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and ELA was born by C-section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis of pregnancy in the conclusion.
It is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which then in excessive quantities are found in the blood of pregnant women and, in particular, the itching.
The disease is dangerous for unborn fetus facing premature birth and death for mothers after childbirth usually resolve spontaneously.
EMA and ELA to Eva's and Vaska's luck they were born healthy, even if they were only at 36 weeks.
Emičku placed in an incubator at the intermediate ward, where he works, and that her niece vaškova could take over and check in.
Elinka was larger and right after the transfer of the ICU room, I had it in her possession, describes the difficult period after giving birth to Eva.
She spent 20 days in hospital until doctors nesvolili release babies who had managed to reach the border of two pounds.
Waiting for the weight gain in children in the maternity Eva joy but it didn't.
"I was mad with her husband and children," recalls the difficult moments in the postpartum period quadruple mother.
She and her husband even signing a statement of liability due to, inter alia, necitlivému access to one of the doctors.
But in the end it happened and the doctor was released with the twins, Eve and into a care home.
The stories of four pregnancies and births sends CT1 on Tuesday night at 21: 45 hours.
A large family can downsize.
They live together in a house not far from Prague, where Eva had to make do with the electric dvouplotýnkou and crowded conditions.
A house had increased, but Vasek did Eve happy gas stove is mounted to the preparation of food for the six people more comfortable.
When will nejůř, we take turns on a cab.
Eva is convinced that children, in particular, the perception of family and a pleasant atmosphere, and no size or shabbiness cottage.
For now, we're piecing together very well, better than we expected.
The mess was harder to hide in a small space and kutalející babies are sometimes, but at least we're all around, smiling, Eva, who can find a positive side to every situation.
Vaškova work in film lighting is no guarantee of regular income.
That's why sometimes goes out into the streets as a taxi driver.
In his 60 years in the care of the finances of the family and the children physically can, but how long is it going to be?
"I realize that, due to our age difference that I'm the one who's going to support this family," admits Eva straight when asked about the future.
She'd like to go back to work, but even more tempting option her own business.
With four kids, I'm not a bargain for the employer.
If the worst comes to the worst, we can take turns with her husband, joking about a nice blonde.
Apple suffered a yo-yo effect.
For everything they can display.
Faster processor, a camera with higher resolution, stronger chassis or speech-recognition force touch display, that's the short version of the recently introduced the ninth generation of the iPhone.
The two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6S and 6s plus.
Apple's current trend has been that each new generation iPhone is easier than the previous one.
Except for the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to the previous iphonům.
Dvougramový weight difference to the detriment of the news was truly negligible.
The new iPhone, however, is far from being the case.
Compared to last year's 6 and 6 plus iphonům mass had grown at the smaller model is about 14 grams for more then about 20 grams.
On the one hand, no wonder the affair last year, bending in pockets, apple racked up considerably.
The chassis of the news is so resilient aluminium alloy 7000, which also had an effect on weight.
But the much bigger impact they have on her display.
The technology used in Apple's new 3D touch, which displays the strength they can touch.
It was necessary to display another layer of capacitive sensors.
Mass displays of new iPhones as compared to previous generations increased by more than double.
At the smaller iPhone originally from 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of larger then from 19 to 40 grams.
The iPhone 6s is so used to display the hardest component.
Weight only 143 grams is then for this news achieved thanks to a treadmill, which affected most of the remaining components.
The larger model is then applied to the hardest element of the battery, its weight, however, compared with predecessors didn't change.
Even in this case, it is evident that the greatest increase in the display.
IPhone 6s plus 5.5 "weight that reaches 192 grams.
How much will the new display technology, will not take effect until use.
The first users will be able to test it on the Friday September 25, when will be launched in selected countries, sales of iPhones 6S and 6s plus.
Oats are already the breakfast of champions, tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta paglicci, archaeologists have made a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered that the population of modern humans of different ages, including wall paintings, remains of tools, and so on and so forth.
The 23a, which is dated instruments until around 30 years ago but scientists discovered something that closely resembles the remnants of breakfast buffet.
In fact, the traces of oat grains, which obviously went through a process of production, so popular today.
The grains soak, then dry first today, get rid of the package, the so-called glumellae, then steamed and rozlisují flat.
Cave in paglicci were able to discover grains, which was apparently nahřáta or buried, and then he probably crushed between two millstones - at least that's what the evidence of the use of the two rocks in the cave.
The scientists thus failed in its publication for the magazine PNAS demonstrate that the cave was a complete production process, but the similarity is striking.
We have no evidence about how people could eat cereal, but the theory that it was with a liquid and maybe even warm, of course, offers a completely logical.
At the same time, it's a very interesting document of how intensely people use cereals long before the development of agriculture.
If it is the oldest vločková interpretation is correct, the cereal ahead of agriculture about twenty thousand years.
New train station in the city of Brno.
So I listened once again to report the names of the stops in the trolleybus: hnusáčkova, ghost, frázova, spratecká.
Of course, the cable car was a bit noisier, so reports a man ’ s voice was somewhat less comprehensible than before, when the station reported in a female voice.
A woman's voice is higher, so the noise of traffic is more recognizable than the deeper the man's voice.
Although dpmb.cz argues that the anchor chose the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but I'm sure that out of studio recordings made in silence, which of course sounded quite differently than in the noise of the bus engine.
I live in Brno a few decades, so the correct names of all those zastávkek I know by heart, so I don't need this report, but foreigners from elsewhere in Brno and for which they are intended, in particular, this report may be confused and may on the final, where they came by accident, then claim that the stop, which should get out of the car, was not reported.
Maybe he should be the choice of speaker - but better anchor again - do it again, and this time, tinged with the usual traffic noise and the noise of the engine in which the bleating of a speaker on the bus is almost lost.
So we don't have to keep listening to the names of the stations, water heršpice šmírova, or then dive in the creaking šalině to which I transferred in VW.
I assume that my old ears had worsened suddenly so much during that one day, when the announcer calls changed.
Before that day, I understood the reports quite well.
Good morning, sir.
From the notes traťováka.
Not many people know this, but what the government parties were the biggest and brightest so-called comprehensive background checks.
I took the liberty to reminisce.
The bus was late.
The Controller's office into the moment he came on the radio, that's just seven hours.
"you're lucky, that you hit with Comrade Chief, came a minute before you, and it seems that's not in the mood," said the dispatcher, while I'm writing in a log book.
Thanks, I will.
Tell me that I'm going after the districts for the revision of the small mechanisation.
It won't work, today there are background checks.
They are all shitting bricks.
What's it all about?
"you'll see," said the dispatcher.
Next time, you will be, too.
I ran out into the hallway.
The door opened and he appeared náčelnikárny chief.
Dry, deadpan, in an impeccably tailored uniform.
"good morning, Master Chief," I said politely, and quickly switched the two buttons on his uniform jacket.
"good morning," came the reply, and I quickly ran to the second floor, I realized I was cold, the ominous tone of old, he said.
"you're messing with," welcome me engineer Eva, an elderly lady, which I appreciated.
She said she was even demoted her chief than comrades.
They are vetting, and you get barely.
How many times have I asked you, what are you a comprehensive background check, but one doesn't really want to talk about.
They tend to be once every three years, must the rest of them, and it's very unpleasant.
At least for some.
He said, however, I see.
I pulled out of the drawer in the file with periodic reports, and then the phone.
"this holcman, come to me," said the chief's voice.
What is that?
We just met and not... "I muttered, but no one answered me, alone with my thoughts.
"good morning, sir, I'm here at your command," I shall, I barely omeldoval entered náčelnikárny.
The chief was sitting behind the desk and a clipboard.
"comrade mechanizátore," he said, without looking up, and still looking closely at that paper, "your behaviour doesn't appeal to me."
He dropped the paper on the table, leaned back in his chair and stared at me, blanked the usual nasty, evil, and piercing.
I faltered.
What's going on?
Yesterday, his deputy, said that in a few months as I've worked out very well and is very happy with me.
The Chief did very well when he pulled me out of the squad for the long-haul event.
And now this?
You do realize that you're the tech track distance and that's all there is to it.
Such a greeting, like you used this morning, is simply unacceptable.
I said that I use a greeting from my childhood, I was brought up that way and I don't see anything wrong with it.
The chief that was like a red rag to a turkey.
"you're a socialist rail and the only acceptable greeting is an honour," said the chief of petulance.
And besides, you're still reaching out to his superiors.
Once you say "sir" and it's "comrade".
But I'm no master chief, but the chief comrade.
Deputies are comrades, deputy chief traťmistři comrades are upper traťmistři!
That's in your mind!
Excuse me, sir... sir, but I salute you normal civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... it's an honour and a job, or comrade... you know... I'm not in the side.
"it's not your priority, you're not in the cold side," said the chief, who had calmed down a bit.
Still talking about that.
Anyway, remember that the top of the chair you have pre-paid into retirement.
It wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something is not his priority, with the concerned it didn't look good.
He stared at me for a moment, cold, piercing and I searched for words I would have said.
I'm also annoyed that his haughty first name basis.
He was just a few years older and playing God, actually soudruhaboha.
Breezy, cocky, arrogant, authoritarian, as it suited the moment.
All to be even more.
So be it, it's the chief.
Actually, not all of them, the President of the party organisation he like all straníkům, but even nestraníkům, informally.
But the chief informally to many, particularly those in which he could exert his superiority.
Right now, for me he full of shit.
I thought about my ass and it cost me a lot of effort for me to shoot him in the face.
But it wouldn't even make it to stretch to the picks, let alone trying to do an official for railways.
What do I feed two kids?
And out of the house!
I was ready to cry but I controlled myself.
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
"that's all for now, you can go," an audience with the chief and he began looking again the paper, which had been in the hands.
He called me at 11: 30.
Everyone from the office were already there and on what issues, and how they answered that, yes, that would be good.
Only jožin pointedly said, as was his wont, we can't all work out, because I would have had to do with his comrade chief himself, and that there was no danger.
The word "comrade" pointed out, as if he knew what me old wiped away in the morning.
It was quite a gathering in náčelnikárně.
Comrade Chief behind his desk at a long conference table the other comrades, who had to decide about my way of life or death.
Cadre, President Roh, a reporter from personnel officer for special purposes, in the army, and a deputy kontráše, my boss.
And also the most important person, the President of the party organisation.
I knew him from the road.
A track worker podbíjel sleepers or pitchfork thrown gravel.
But also a former prison guard.
There were rumours at the time that it wasn't any fun, says a big beast.
It emerged that a school in the seventh grade, no more trade, no he couldn't.
And when the prison was canceled, he ended up on a Sunday-afternoon picks.
But, comrade, that yeah, comrade was forged.
Chief motioned for me to sit.
My heart in my throat, nespolknutelná cone.
Read the report of the Committee of civil personnel manager from a place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two kids, and so on and so forth.
So far, so good, I thought, and I breathe a little better.
Then the report from the organization.
This reflects the opinion of the Committee, is the same person wrote both.
But then it came!
Parents are longtime members of the party, refused to appear before the Commission and, subsequently, a revision from the speakers, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked sharply at me.
Cadre noticed and stopped reading.
The chief indicated that he should continue.
The rest was just worse.
I was a member of the municipal committee of the SSM, and there I was obtained for the candidate of the party.
Regardless of the parents, who are from the speakers, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and a wedding in addition to the National Committee, I was also in the church.
I trust the parties failed in the worst way.
That's why I was deleted from the ranks of its candidates.
But it wasn't enough.
I had two children baptized, and even his mother when she died, I said a church funeral, though this was a former member of the party.
I say all this negative attitude to the party leadership.
When finished, the chief's personnel manager only pencil tapping the table, punctuated by silence.
Everyone was staring at me and I wish I was somewhere far, far away.
I kept repeating to himself "the Communists - supermen, communists - supermen." what have I got myself into?
Why I stayed in the Smiths?
Fixing points as I can without some crappy clearances.
But now?
Railway official career over before it began.
To return to the squad?
I don't think so, I'm sure the chief me out for an hour.
"comrade, how were you there checking the comrade?" broke the silence on the issue a cadre.
Well, according to the report from previous employment.
You got it?
It was obviously not kádrovákovi twice.
Beads of sweat on the forehead, blinking nervously, as if he himself was prověřovaný.
He nodded vigorously and chief handed a piece of paper.
"well," the chief said with a hint of joviality, but which was often a precursor of a storm.
At first glance, nothing but praise, trained with honors, he graduated from college, he worked as a locksmith piecework, filling in the standard, on average, a hundred and twenty percent.
But that's missing the point.
Where did you get that opinion, comrade? "he turned to a cadre, who felt that it kind of starts to turn against him, and that very soon, I might not even be kádrovákem.
The comrade gave it to me at onset.
That was enough for you?
"well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to the crew," the cadre.
And there are opinions not required, his was, somehow, so I gave it to a folder.
"so, the inclusion of the technical features you this piece of paper," the chief said.
Cadre blinking nervously, and not have to answer.
"never mind, we'll discuss it later," said the chief issue and kádrovákovi looked relieved.
For now, take it.
"what's the matter with you, comrade?" he asked the chief to me again.
Suddenly my vyká, so it's over!
In my eyes I feel dizzy, I felt the heat.
There was a surge of regret and the charges, and I knew it was the ugliest creature on earth that does not deserve the slightest mercy.
I think by planting an incomplete report misled comrade cadre examiner, which I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I received it from a cadre at the factory.
I also antisocialistický element, which at the time of real socialism, supports the building of religious obscurantism, or even participate in them.
That, that, that was a lot of what I've done, or maybe even commit and I silently prayed for it to end.
And I didn't care.
I was one out of my place mechanizátora.
I didn't care that I take the pick.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not the enemy of the people, as in the eyes of Comrade Chief was.
"that's enough, sir," said the party chairman and chief's levity interrupted.
The comrade made a mistake, a terrible mistake.
What a mistake, the right thing to do.
But he's already got his punishment.
Don't forget that, sir!
What could be worse for a young person than he was at the time we close the door to the side.
To be opened again, he will have to prove that he's changed, that is worthy of our trust again.
An uneducated hack talking like a book.
Where did that come from?
She's so well-read or parroted phrases from the partisan training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must get away from us a chance!
A chance to prove that he's changed.
And who does give it to him, if not just you, sir?
It is your duty to this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade, support in his effort to fix!
It's your party, which you'll never be rid of it.
Actually, it's also the duty of all of us.
The comrade needs to see that side of him.
Being a good mother is not only that, but she also loves.
When the president finished, no one said a word.
No one expected such a turnaround situation.
At least I do.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade President," ice said the chief in an attempt to regain the initiative.
If you'd let me finish, you heard that I was going to just such a conclusion.
They all nod their heads, but it was evident that he doesn't believe a word of it.
"so I was confirmed for the independent examiner care about basic resources," I shouted back to the office and then I began to cry.
Another addition to the engineers, Eve, they were all at lunch.
She listened in silence to my incoherent makeup fresh experiences and I had calmed down.
When I finished, she asked whether I'll have a cup of coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, put water on the stove and cups.
Meanwhile, vented about kádrováckých practices.
How one opinion, often full of praise, give a man in the arm, and the second, in which any singer is scum, they will send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was, but a Sunday-afternoon picks, and comrades from the factory didn't know where to send it to.
And our cadre?
This is just old, where what he ate or drank, and then it turned out the way it turned out.
"it's from an old gets it," she said mischievously.
Today, he won't like it.
Still, watch out for him, he's very vindictive.
And party chairman?
In fact, far worse, no humanitarian chief.
Zero from picks with great power.
Boiled water for coffee, and then just in the office was filled with the smell of coffee.
I dropped into a mug and a sugar cube, stirring in the hot potion.
Perhaps I'm out of the woods.
Now I'm not thrown out and another clearance for three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief me that today he won't soon forget.
It came out in the anthology writers on the track II EPICs in publishing
Symbol of life.
Pinwheel bicycle over chlumem after years of spinning again.
To see them from far away, because it is situated on the fifteen feet tall flagpole.
People from a wide area they call him "the fan Chlum."
For the village of 150 inhabitants became one of the elements of the character that the municipality has the opportunity to rally natives in 2010.
"we're pulling about that character, and the character we wanted, of course, everyone knows it," said Mayor George Masek.
Chlumské wind pump is local technical monument.
It's a bit of a memento as well: recalls a time when these people were fighting for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in centuries past was a rarity.
When in 1910 decided chlumští representatives for a solution that suited then until the mid 1980s.
In a village at the mouth of the cave left číchov seven meters deep well.
Three years later they were joined by a metal structure with a wind pump, which benefited from the water in the reservoir at the top of the village, near the church.
"the building has Anthony d border at the expense of Moravia 2 400 crowns," says Memorial inscription on the pedestrian fence construction flagpole.
The pump after a few corrections and falls down a windmill in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, he began to write a new chapter in the fight for water: on this day in Chlum began to serve a new pipe.
Wind pump have remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a rarity here.
The dominant online earlier this year, at a reunion natives.
When in 2008 the chlumští decided that wind round to fix again and again to bring into operation.
They had to build a replica of the original wheels - reduced on average by half a metre.
The bike was fitted to the mast, that same year, however, have to be put down.
The manufacturer of the reply did not choose the right material and the wheel could not resist the wind.
After several years of dominant Odlezelské jezero was dismantled under the roof.
From June this year, however, the bike on a tall pole is spinning again.
At the reunion, the municipality natives left wheel replica edit osadila him again and again and again to the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws water from the well to overflow backwater.
And over the summer it was completely cut off because the well water was scarce.
At least turned up empty.
"in the autumn, then shaft the windmill from the suction pump in the basket off again," said Mayor Masek.
Tower isn't the only municipality in the Czech Republic, where the wind got round to the communal aspect, however, is the only member of this kind in the highlands.
Similar element in the character they have in honour of the local technical monuments such as the chvalkovicích and Green Mountain on vyškovsku in Kuzelov hodonínsku partutovicích fantasies, on the shelf or in the vsetínsku.
No offence, but I don't know, she admitted lafatu rock Tripoli goian.
"the fight against match I remember very well, even my goal, as all of my career," grinned the 34-year- goian at the pre-game press conference.
Georghe Hagi coached us back then, it was too bad that we lost.
I hope I score now Sparta.
The difference is that this time we will not, "said goian.
This is the man who has played 60 games for the Romanian national team, is a key pillar of the Greek team.
A shortstop will face raids Spartan offensive.
It comes a few thousand people, no hell, says about the Greek duel Spartan hop.
And partly, he knows what he can expect on Thursday night.
Well I know fataie, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Luciano.
At the time, I saw all their games.
I know it's a very good striker, too, which is why he went to Sparta, said goian.
Another footballer of the Prague club name, and then came the question, if he even knows David lafatu, top scorer in the history of the Czech League and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and lightly with a reproachful look he was aiming at the Czech press.
Clueless expression on his face marked: "why are you asking me this?"
After a moment of silence, he said.
We saw some videos and I've noticed that a lot of Sparta plays for the team.
He's got some really good players.
And lafata?
No offence, but I don't know anyone else besides fataie.
The Spartans about goianovi knows very well.
"my experience of the larger clubs, you could say that keeping defense asterasu, it's their organizer of the games," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav hob.
Goian's best years may be behind him, but boasts a very interesting football resume.
Its time to care for him, Borussia Dortmund - Stuttgart, both Manchester United and city, units of steauy but headed into the Italian Palermo, he played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for the aggressive, and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing The European cups, he fights for victory in the Czech League.
For me, it's the favorite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want the group to launch a good result.
Like Sparta, we try to win, said goian.
I'm in the room with the Slovak goalie Tomas košickým, which on an opponent from the Czech Republic enjoyed a lot.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can tell you that we're going to fight hard.
Coke is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, is considering entry into the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new seat should have coke in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland because of trading in shares of the company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary objective is to be the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we've taken so far in the project launched, are mostly legal and administrative and have no impact on what happens in society, says Daniel buryš, chief financial officer of the group coke.
"in connection with the transfer of the registered office of the group shareholders are considering the placement of shares in an IPO."
For entry to the Prague Stock Exchange completes the company prospectus, present in the earliest days of the Czech National Bank for approval.
The transfer of the headquarters of the holding company and related share transfers will be made by means of a private transaction that they contribute only to existing shareholders.
In the context of this operation is no shares will be offered to the public or to subscribe to new investors.

The company has previously stated that any offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of the offer of shares on the stock market in the Czech Republic and in Poland, including the placement of the shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
A test of objectivity in reporting on Czech Television migrantské crisis.
Another little test of objectivity and balance of the main Czech news media about the refugee crisis.
This time the main broadcast news bulletins, Czech Television.
And how did she pass?
When they are on the faculty of journalism to teach about how the media can manipulate reality, to be broadcast today, the Czech television event.
Migrantské crisis was dedicated to about 80% of the news broadcasts.
Except for the first minute, when informed about the riots on Thu srbsko-maďarské border and attacks on police officers are euphemistically called migrants, they have run out of patience - they threw rocks and attacked with metal bars), driving the current promigrantská propaganda - The judge names of individual stories.
Criticism of non-governmental organisations - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticise the bad treatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the school - the story of the integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not just as a threat but as a chance.
Wandering refugees - Thu consistently used expressions a runner or a runaway and not a migrant.
What's striking is that the camera uses Thu ilustračních consistently and only footage on small children and women.
But in the same broadcast stated that, of the migrants apprehended in the Czech Republic is 80% men.
Summary: for the most part, propaganda, which is unprecedented from communist agitek.
I have to say, as a former journalist colleagues to shame.
Ecology in practice.
When I used to be able to place concrete building, I soon ceased to be the sole inhabitant.
I moved in on a Formica toilet roaches.
Roaches domestic, insects with incomplete metamorphosis, i.e., neprodělávající the transition from Caterpillar to bug and cub looks like an adult, it's just a small and gradually rising.
I was disgusting and I took to it.
First, manually and chemically later.
Socialist drugstore at their disposal to provide a sort of blue crystals.
I think it was called Zyklon-B.
Or something else?
The break-up but it is a success.
Later, I dealt with it with the Pharaohs.
A box with a sort of juvenalizátorem, who brought the ants to the nest, and then he allowed the queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went on, I became the object of my admiration and, increasingly, I'm leaning towards the view that they have the same right to life as us humans.
Plus, I have carried life experience, that the interference with the ecosystem does not lead to success and a pest can replace the other.
True for fleas and bedbugs would probably worsen ain't karma by killing them.
At the new location with a partner we agreed that if we're not roaches crawling on my neck, to sit down and eat the chips, renegade skin, some invisible eyelashes and the like.
Their quiet existence over time, disrupt the spider.
It was the usual kind of pokoutníka, who was on the ceiling.
We should consider that the lives of the occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased the comfort.
Because we have lived for several years, we found out that they eat mainly rybenkami and their numbers have apparently remained at constructing únosném condition.
Regular intimate contact with each of the need, we discovered that it is female.
We were witnessing romantic courtship with her partner about a third less, how careful is fraying threads of spider webs, in order not to get eaten before it reaches the desired copulation.
It took about three days ago, when the moving and not to respond to our control.
Under the toilet bowl, where love games played, we're next to the female later found the remains of a male.
Then the spider long weeks, didn't move.
If we think he's been in, we were amazed at the amount of small spiders, hanging around in her neighborhood.
Soon they disappeared.
The work they were eaten by the mother, the work of scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
If she went somewhere else or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, popped back up on the ceiling.
True, somewhat smaller, probably the daughter of praobyvatelky toilet.
From the ceiling while warily watching our behaviour and transfer under the toilet bowl to evaluate our non-aggression as friendship.
The numbers somewhat seeding rybenek declined again and a spider in his normal activities to ensure the food.
For a whole year to our ecosystem.
Our daughter has reached the age when the use of pot was a disgrace.
So far we have tolerated it, but eternal spilling its contents to us.
We still strongly to the use of the toilet.
The daughter, however, found an excuse to maintain their habit in the spider, which when I see very well.
We are talking about a spider, good luck in the house didn't have at all.
Crying and screaming to coerce your potty.
There was no avoiding it.
There was a moment when he had to, in the interest of the spider evolutionary shift, the boss's daughter.
It was left up to me.
He was captured in a jar and banished from the balcony into the garden.
I was saying goodbye to him as a friend, but I felt awful after so long living together, as if out of a relative.
We assumed that the roaches will appear more often and they begin to multiply at a geometric rate.
Surprise, surprise, a week or two, we wasn't there.
I began to speculate on the cause.
I was wondering if there's a spider in the ants somehow grown that the environment is not as favourable to the toilet for their existence as we thought.
But then there were the first pieces of medium size, and never came back.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their loss, and I found that their link with the spider must have been the cause, when you can't see it, that it is hidden away in some other place, and that the danger to them from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some sort of telepathic contact with a predator and its rapid disappearance triggered an alarm response in them.
All the more reason that their eyesight no illusions.
A light show, but shyness that would respond to the waving of the hands or quick movements, it's not.
My daughter goes to the toilet regularly.
I think you forgot the chamber pot.
All that's left is to attract back some spider.
I've got your card into the ether and hope for me after the execution, Jeanne.
Otherwise we would have to use the Cyclone b.
The Ten Commandments of Albert Einstein, which enriched the world.
The statements of scientists of the last century, humanity must never cease to fascinate.
He managed to dive so deeply into everything, that has always been the product of an amazing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the greatest scientists of all time.
The awareness of people came for his special and general theory of relativity, which describes the universe so far, preferably in a gigantic proportions.
Nor can we overlook his clarification fotoefektu kvantování or thought of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the mere hodnoty and system knowledge popular theory of relativity is for many a convoluted enough that, for the intimate acquaintance rather opt for easy comparisons.
It's not easy, however.
Of course it wouldn't be Albert Einstein, even if on this brilliantly found a simplified explanation: an hour in the vicinity of your man seems just a minute; a minute in hot oven an hour - and it appears that's relativity.
I took the liberty of all his famous quotations to choose 10 of the Pleiades, which literally mesmerized me.
Intelligent people are trying to solve problems, genius is trying to do.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
At first, I'm not so sure.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove that I was right.
However, the only time can prove that I was wrong.
But it's a sad time, when it is easier to disintegrate an atom than to destroy prejudices.
If the mess on the table reflects the mess in mind, then what reflects an empty desk?
I don't know what we'll be fighting in the third world war, but in the fourth it will be with sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect him.
It is dangerous to know little and know many too.
If I had had an hour to tackle the problem, which would save my life, I spent 40 minutes in his studio, 15 minutes and 5 minutes in his analysis, his solutions.
The hardest thing in the world to understand the income tax.
Finally, I cannot forbear to Einstein's formula for success: taking on the definition of success, and the formula a = x + y + z, where x is y and the rest of the job, is to keep your mouth shut.
The new and modern.
Hospital waiting for changes in Zlín region for $1.5 billion.
"it's an accomplishment, considering that this year all four holds in the black," said the captain - who was with.
Total profit regional facilities at this moment is about 32 million kroner.
The shares are mostly higher reimbursement from insurance companies, which are as favourable for this year.
This really shows that after poor years, the hospital finally can afford a bigger investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherský hold and Shepperton thanks to happen to the edifice, which together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
A long period of time, especially when we're buying appliances, is over.
Now we have to build a new building, because without them, the high-end health care can do, to justify plans for health care, the Regional Deputy Petr Nečas.
The changes are in all hospitals.
Clients come to hospitals next year.
Vsetín now choose the supplier of a new internal pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
In Kroměříž have scheduled an addition of dialysis.
Uherske Hradiste wants to open this year, central pavilion build a medical, for around $200 million.
And zlínskou baťovu hospital waiting the long-delayed construction of a new central income and medical ward, which will take three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, it is the fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"for the whole region, patients and doctors, it's an extremely important step," she said, for example, to build medical vsetínské Hospital Director Vera prousková.
A five-story building there is supposed to be finished in about two years and offers comfort for medical equipment and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds, and intensive care unit.
Convenience for patients.
The changes, which will significantly affect the most patients of all regions.
The new building will replace those in which lies, for example, many patients in the same room, on the floor, they need only one bathroom, beds are nepolohovatelné, leaking windows and paramedics do not have adequate conditions for work.
"for example, our interna was built 35 years ago, and now it's on the border of their useful life," pointed out while the hospital director Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years, because it will replace the seven-storey modern building connected to the emergency room.
Doctors and patients will be in one place all the acute division, especially in new areas.
The same model is already half done Uherske Hradiste.
Central reception and standing within three years will be added to the ward.
"we pay for the construction of the loan, and partly from his own resources," said Director Peter Brewer.
It is the hospital's own funding as the only one in the country can afford.
He still has the highest profit and loss are not even two years ago, when the hospital was dealing with Zlin almost dvousetmilionovou loss.
"we have good contracts with insurance companies, an excellent performance, increasing revenues and effectively manage costs in the entire hospital," named Rudolf vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
The improvement will be even patients kroměřížské hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years will go to repairs, new equipment, and reconstruction up to half a billion crowns.
This year, he's already done the repair station, then begin rehabilitation of dialysis, or the construction of a new building for an mri.

No one explained to me how I should be adopted to keep refugees in the country, if you don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan CHOVANEC (ČSSD), after meeting with his European colleagues complain that the Czech Republic is pushing other States to adopt quotas to redistribute refugees, but refuse any discussion.
He also points out that, so far, no one has explained how he had assigned to keep refugees in the Czech Republic, when we just don't want to live.
"we didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted to make the quotas have been dropped from the final text," said inmate journalists.
More specifically, can you describe the position that you have come to the meeting of Ministers of the Interior and the State of the European Union?
We disagree with the mandatory quotas as a system that simply won't work.
We can't talk about migrants like bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings which have some vision, going somewhere, they got some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues, how we're able to migrants on the territory of the Member States to maintain, if redistribuovali.
We can't imagine it.
We didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted to make the quotas have been dropped from the final text.
With other findings - functional hotspots, registrars, border protection, the camps outside Europe, a trust fund for the African countries and other things, we don't have any problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we say that this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Not long ago we talked about forty thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do you keep people on that territory?
Ninety eight per cent of all the people who pass through us, wants to go to Germany.
He didn't want us to almost no one, we simply don't know how to keep them here.
We have the ambition to go to other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as the destination country, receiving us fireman today, but the interest of the people of this migration waves, from Syria and other countries is approaching close to zero.
You mentioned that, actually, they don't want us to be refugees, but fifteen hundred people we've already committed to take.
Would it not be possible to adopt them this way more?
We have pledged to accept 1500 people, but with the condition.
We said: the functional hot spots, border control, military operation.
Even in the 1500's, that's 1100 people deal with asylum procedure.
They will come to our detention facility, and we will treat them the same as those that we captured.
The big question is, and that's what we're going to debate with Europe if we can detain people, who will be registered in Italy and in Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe has to act so that, in order to register, they can't be detained.
That means, they come to our country with the registration, and if the agreement is not yet, it may be that even those 1100 hold on the territory of the Czech Republic, and they're coming in again to leave Germany.
If we can contain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, asylum procedure, we will deal with them.
If it's the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 percent, according to European statistics, receive international protection.
Then they get the documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think that these people end up once again in the target countries.
Then there's four hundred people přesídlovat.
This is the second project, which is still there, and the only progress we've made in that debate with churches, the possibility that they could help get them jobs, housing and so on.
But it is a very long haul.
You said that at the meeting of Ministers with us the other States were not willing to discuss.
But it's not so that the Czech Republic just refused to quotas, but does not offer any joint action that would unlock the discussion here?
And what exactly is it you think solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany will cast an incentive that all migrants from Syria, they can have access to them, as the news spread in the hours after the camps all over Europe, but also in Turkey, in Jordan.
It calls for more migration wave, which is going to Germany, because the us just don't want.
We think that the protection of external borders - just you deter waves of migration, to help those in need, and to separate the economic migrants.
Definitely let them know that they don't stand a chance.
Just last year, came to Germany with fifty thousand Kosovars.
Safe from Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of the State, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor ’ s office.
If we managed to separate them and accept them or accept only according to the needs of the economies, so should the fifty percent of the social systems in vain for them today, they could go to the refugees.
On the first day, when Germany's introduction of controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic.
Now it is 80 years old, the first day it was twelve.
Where it does occur, to border controls tightened?
We were afraid to hold hundreds of people.
These are numbers that we got.
We still have a few hundred vacancies in land-based detention facilities.
Of course, all the people that hold them, we'll be back within seven days of Austria.
We do this by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who these people are, with Hungary's complicated and Greeks - it's completely pointless story.
Where is the tipping point?
It would have to be a grand a day?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two or three consecutive days, we will run out of capacity, enough contingency plans will succeed.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately called an emergency government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're several times a day in telephone contact.
If this is the situation, the government can sit and one by de facto immediately would have decided to reinforce the army, police, customs or prison services.
The extreme option is a state of emergency, which now in some places declared Hungary?
I think it can't happen to us.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state in Europe, Schengen border we have only, and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen in order for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to alarm information.
All the information we have, whether it's from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, it rather suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the flow of migration to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route into Austria.
The Czech Republic that would have offended very marginally, at all.
Slavia paid off at the last moment, a large part of the debt.
He's trying to avoid bankruptcy.
Football Slavia pay debts.
Their money and their players.
On Tuesday, the first time football Slavia stood for insolvency proceedings before the Court of First Instance.
Almost three months after her for roughly 20 million kroner, the company applied for online services from Pacific countries of Samoa.
Attorney Susan vamps Mládková tried to judge Michael wenzlovou within a few hours to make sure he doesn't have over slavií bankruptcy.
And, needless to say, from the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the week before the new owner of a large Chinese industrial vamps and investment group cefc and Czech billionaire Jiri šimáně.
Obviously, since the new owners came in the club money, and at the last moment.
It shows the observations from the trial Tuesday, the vamps - vršovický club on Monday, just a day before the hearing in court, he owed tens of millions of crowns.
"everything was between September 11 and 15 September, paid," stated attorney Mládková vamps.
Slavia, who paid for that?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Czech or Slovak exreprezentantovi Milano Ivan záložníkovi Maria ličkovi.
Slavia also has paid the agent Alexander losenickemu.
On Friday the club pay the outstanding fees of Prague 10.
Part of the insolvency proceedings remain de facto only claims that the vamps.
Either the liabilities incurred by the club at all, or result in litigation.
However, we are prepared in the event of failure of those disputes the amount to pay.
"we have the necessary funds in a bank account, which can produce a statement of account," she told Judge Advocate Mládková.
"everything is paid in arrears," said Mládková and added that the only are unpaid or disputed liabilities.
Also certain is that, in the next few days the judge decides and the proceedings will continue.
Match gave three weeks to send detailed evidence that it actually paid off the debts.
Subsequently, there will be an evaluation of all the evidence.
The decision can be expected in November, as soon as possible.
The judge ordered the continuation of negotiations on November 3.
The decision, however, she will not fall at this meeting, but only in writing.

Bianca was build to poignant.
But it would cost about half a billion more, says an expert from a firm that tunnel.
Bianca could imbue even safer, says an expert.
Blanka tunnel complex could be built so as to avoid two busts of soil in the Prague Park, says the director of the satra, which is the main designer, Alexander butovič tunnel.
He said that on Wednesday evening, during the press tour for the tunnel.
But according to him, it would have been about half a billion kroner more expensive.
Drivers will be open this Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between cost and security.
"the tunnel could make safer, but the costs are growing exponentially," said butovič.
The conditions in the park have been under him after the same thing all the time, yet the country collapsed just a few steps from the place where he began to make safer and more careful method.
"if that was the measure used about 500 meters before the tunnel would have been about half a billion more expensive," said butovič.
Blanka tunnel during the construction failed three times.
Twice, in 2008, there was a crater in the park, in 2010, fell to the ground at the Culture Ministry in Prague 6.
According to the CEO of Metrostav George bělohlava tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he said, the EURO weekly.
The structure was intended to be 17 billion crowns.
When you add in VAT, which popped up twice for the construction period, of the 17 billion have twenty-one.
Add to that a technology buyouts of land and engineering, indexation and similar items, it's 29 billion, which is no longer from the 37 So far, said Bělohlav

FedEx profits mixed, reduce the fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in full-year profit forecasts because of low demand for freight and higher costs for the inland division.
The company also stated that the holiday is planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Shares of the company fell about 2.5 percent in trading předtržním 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx indicates that expects earnings between $V5 and $V5 for the fiscal year, which ends next May, which represents a decrease of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an increase in interest rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will take effect in January 4, and higher bonuses for ground transport heavy or big packages, which start in November.
The company stated that it expects profit growth compared with the previous year because of cost reductions, higher revenue, and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "showed a solid performance despite a weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing sector and a global trade."
Holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rivalská ups stated that he plans to hire 90 000 to 95 000 extra staff, which is probably just as they hired last year.
In the quarter, which ended in August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is about 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share amounted to $probable, which is less than the $2.44 per share, which was predicted 12 analysts the Zacks investment research.
Sales increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been in recent years, hit by the decline in international priority shipping, which caused revenue in its express unit stagnated.
But the boom in online shopping, FedEx results boost ground troops.
The Inland Revenue in the last quarter rose by about 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger parcels and your own insurance.
The express unit recorded a higher income due to the higher base rates, while profit decreased in the cargo trade because of higher prices for labour.
Předtržním in about an hour before the opening of trading, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
Ended Tuesday with a decrease of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of 11 June.
At its hottest meetings in years, Federal Reserve policymakers this week will spend two days at 27 feet long and Honduran mahogany table will determine whether, after almost ten years the time has come to increase the key interest rate.
Towering above them at one end of the Central Bank, the two-storey design conference room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The central bank has a dual charge of Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep the price stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be x-faktorem in too close to the predictable decision, which is to be announced on Thursday, about whether the US economy is ready to start in the decommissioning of the unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates in place since the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows solid growth of the economy, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the fed already cautious about adding to volatility by increasing its benchmark federal funds rate — and that's nothing more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"it is clear that the labour market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"but I think they were just looking for an excuse to not hiking rates, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient reason to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed does, which is in itself a cause of nervousness on the financial markets.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Blomberg had anticipated an increase in rates this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to hold off on the matter, a key indicator of only about 30% chance of an increase.
That would have pointed to a decline in the stock market, in the event that the Fed will raise rates only if politicians will fall in the promise of further increases in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped about 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599,85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that the Fed will delay rate politicians this week in peace, says John Lonski, the chief economist at Moody's capital markets research group.
"it would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates," It states.
If it's the politicians, the Fed did, "they would have to go to great lengths in the programme Declaration and holding hands in the financial markets, not to panic."
Other experts said that the increase in rates would have calmed financial markets, because it would remove the uncertainty of how the Fed will proceed.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the Fed is on track to raise rates by 0.25 of a percentage point this month, the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions, which would confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that through the spring and early summer is expected to increase rates this year, despite complaints from liberals, there is a need for more economic progress.
Even if job creation slowed in August, the job market this year, recorded solid growth.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
And even though inflation remains below the Central Bank's annual 2% target, the Fed policymakers argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.
"the economy can cope with higher rates, and he needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to struggle at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by up to 16% below its all-time high value in May, when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy dragging down global growth.
The market rebounded slightly this month, and only the Dow has lost almost 10% from the peak in May.
The Fed ’ s policy makers anxious market situation adds a complex calculus, when to start raising interest rates.
"in the absence of that, what happened in the financial markets, and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA ziman center for real estate and a former Fed official.
Now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"there's a lot of uncertainty about what impact it will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data on which they could rely on the latest developments in China," oliner said.
The health of the global economy is one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically shouldn't be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed became the monetary authority all over the world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years was enormous.
The mere suggestion of the then chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013, that the Fed could "taper" its monetary expansion in the market, triggered spasms throughout the world.
In a world where the markets and the economy are getting more closely intertwined, it can be expected that Fed officials also are watching developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central bankers, and experts in order to read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more of an art than a science," said Zachary karabell, head of Global Strategy for envestnet bohatství-management Company Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "the Fed has history with exaggerated movements on the financial markets, which seem inconsistent with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, which pushed for the increase in rates, citing as an example the decision in 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point during three meetings "identifiable, despite the limited impact on growth in the U.S.," said Lacker.
A year later, Fed officials turned these cuts.
The Fed should prioritise financial stability concerns only during the Great Depression, as was the market meltdown of 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee setting rates by the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil to even come close to this level, he said.
"you don't want to be in a situation of fear from the growth rates, because markets are upset," said Posen, president of Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate and does not refer to financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.

Speed on motorways will stay the same.
Acceleration to 150 km / h, was rejected by the House of Commons.
On selected sections of motorway in favourable conditions, it will not be possible to increase the speed limit to 150 km / h.
On Tuesday, the House of Representatives decided, when she stepped on the amendment to the Senate, which refused to increase speed.
Amendments to the law on the road now goes to the President.
President Milos Zeman, in late April, said that the law would allow the speed of ninety vetoed.
He was also against an increase in transport minister dan ťok (Yes), according to which the Czech Highway network is not designed for such a speed.
Ťok Tuesday before MPs supported the Senate version of the bill.

The amendments also removed the option to introduce electronic highway signs instead of paper, which will apply after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it would save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
Ústecký exprimátor goes to trial.
For the baby shower in 10 years.
The case concerns alleged overpriced projects the baby shower.
The police in this case to prosecute and assemblywoman Susan kailovou (ČSSD), the Chamber of Deputies, but it didn't.
According to the legal case is two to ten years in prison.
The trial is scheduled for two days in October.
According to prosecutor mandík with macíkem have caused damage to at least one million crowns, is clear of the charges.
The applicant relies on expert opinion.
Former members of the leadership of the city according to the applicant, by virtue of their functions help to obtain a property illegally for the benefit of society, which organised the baby shower.

Both charges driven by the aim of ensuring the company darothore for awarding public contracts on the staging of the baby shower in Usti nad Labem in the long term and at least acted in a coordinated manner at odds with the requirement for the procedure, with due care, says the prosecutor.
At the same time, according to him, were aware that the company subsequently darothore after obtaining this contract be cleared Usti nad Labem in the implementation of the actions of the baby shower award, which will be compared to the fair value of the services actually provided disproportionately inflated.
In three years, according to the file, the company behind the project collected more than five million kronor.
The city eventually paid off just one part, roughly 1.7 million kronor, then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid was the expert opinion of at least one million kroner overpriced.
Mandík before any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any offence, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this contrived story, said earlier that the former mayor of the city under his leadership just piggybacked on a similar project from past years.
In the years 2008 to 2010 event the agency Roxy II.
"it was the same conditions for the same money," added mandík.

Hungarian police officers allegedly released the dog.
Then forced journalists to delete the footage.
He said the police at the Hungarian border with Serbia briefly detained AP cameraman and forced him to delete the recording, on which a police dog allegedly knocked down a fugitive.
The Hungarian Government but denies this charge.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday night, when the AP cameraman filming, Luca Muzi, migrants across the cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke crossing the border with Serbia.
Against the refugees turned to the officers and one of them left a Syrian attack dog with a basket on its nose.
A dog of a man who was shouting "please, please, please, please, I'm a runner," and he says men.
That man all filming, he noticed one of the officers and wouldn't let him leave.
A journalist then I couldn't even make a phone call to his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The officers were taken to a dark place muziho at registration centres for refugees and asked him to show them what is recorded.
Then ordered him to erase the footage.
The men came as the result of a two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger, because they were dogs.
The AP sent a letter of protest to the spokesman zoltánu Kovács, the Hungarian Government.
The behaviour of cops in it as unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risk of physical violence, and we won't have to worry that the government will destroy the material obtained legally.
Kovács, referring to a police report muziho narrative of events questioned.
He said that the police just wanted to show them the journalist, whether they are on some shots, to which they are entitled.
When they found out that they're not there, they didn't make it.
"dogs may bark - are trained and a little fear odstrašovali chasing, but not with certainty," says Kovacs.
Unpredictable League champions.
A win for city will kick us, believes Juventus
"it's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of the city.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic game of the Champions League.
Neither team created a lot of chances, but we had football boots the ball longer.
"the cause of defeat, not in the tactics of Juventus just scored two beautiful goals a game," said Pellegrini, whose team cashed in competitive matches after long 636 minutes.
Last season's runner-up Juventus were mutual encounter exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, as the defending champion only point and with the score 2: 4 is up to 16th place in the table.
That is also why the turnover at Etihad stadium was the big surprise.
"this will help us psychologically, kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Mestre, which it had been before the New Year to deal with the loss of three pillars - Italy, téveze and Vidal.
In Manchester is blocking pogba, mandžukič and Morata.
"it's so, this victory is very important, perhaps thanks to him we're going on a winning wave," hoping for Morata.
Because when we're on it, among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the offensive phase.
This is the result of my players deserve.
"balancing our goal, we may be able to cash in on the 0: 2, but (No hold us up," said coach goaltender buffona Mestre.
"we burned several good chances," sorry Yayu tourého midfield, city.
We need to take the experience of the Champions League and next time to try for a better outcome.
Goodbye, farewell to the old Germany II.
Before we go on about immigrants, we should remember that all the media frenzy around is managed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media, and also from above.
And so let us pause for a moment.
Today, news and media are full of babies, which are at the hands of their parents after the dusty roads of the exodus.
And that raises in a man - in a European man - automatic guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't come here just desperate children, notice the footage of their boats to the Greek islands, babies on them is not so much to see!
Well, the last time us somehow disappeared from the TV pictures of ships heading to lampedusu, refugees from the French border near Menton, whose beautiful promenade of thousands of young men.
Largely young black men.
And also the pictures from Calais, where these brown and black men are waiting, if they manage to get through the tunnel under the English Channel.
I guess it doesn't.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian Church Eritreans somehow didn't think the peoples of Europe.
Much of it was disproved.
So when it comes to the quota for refugees, somehow, that it's not just the poor little children from Syria, but also about the styling - for older: vyfešákované fashionably - young men.
The musculature of which look like they've just climbed out of a gym.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish part of Cyprus - a Muslim - lying on the private beach of the hotel.
No matter that it was a private, arrived at the beach, a large group of cars.
But no ham.
And one of them got out young black men.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years ago.
They went to the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes in hand, of course, smartphones.
It's a private beach, caring and staff - the Turks, Muslims - they are obviously worried.
Occupied all the deckchairs.
Who was on it and was in the sea, he was unlucky.
They were dressed as the American rapperského film.
Wearing a hat with a fingernail, white and colored Adidas shoes on his feet.
Besieged the local beach bar and feasting.
The tables around, stuff sitting next to brown and white guests bar - Read it Muslims and Europeans, without being asked.
Mothers with children, fleeing the dining terrace somewhere in peace.
Incoming Indians drink beer straight from the třetinek - as in the series, from the USA?! - on the beach, they threw empty bottles around.
Constantly shouting loudly at each other.
In English, of course, it was.
Then they also drink wine straight from the bottle.
They jumped into a hotel swimming pool in a bathing suit, especially those young ladies, in the water screaming and shouting, mothers with children and pensioners ran away and half an hour later, he was on the beach or in a swimming pool or one nečerný guest.
They all disappeared.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter my night under his breath he said: "you see that sweetie, what they wore?"
"yeah," I said.
"well, it certainly wouldn't work," said the waiter.
I thought: "I know, I know, they all had a massive gold chains around their necks.
And the one he had on his neck, like a massive cross of gold.
And the women were like a jewelry store.
"these are drug traffickers?" I asked.
"well, you saw how drinking," the waiter said.
Party drugs, or not.
They tell you something completely different.
So, it was clear to me what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105 it wasn't so important for me.
I had no idea what would follow.
But the Secret Service and top politicians ought to be the first to know.
I don't know.
In Europe at the time, has about 1.5 million immigrants.
And they go and they come and they go.
Now it turns out that the main problem of the European Union, is that politicians, intellectuals and totalitně-politicko-korektní like them linked to lobbying and economically important groups in Europe have the greatest power.
Germany and its politicians now publicly accepted the main power in Europe - they lie, lie and lie - but they're not the only ones, the leaders of the EU and the TV, including our own.
For example, the recent television images of excited about welcoming refugees in Germany are at the level of a Moscow television images from August 1968.
Of course, the station was a few sluníčkářů, but mainly - staroněmečtí - Muslims greeted her counterpart.
The long weeks of blather on the news on Czech Television, how they are, according to some research, almost all Germans for the arrival of immigrants.
Of course, who was only a few days in Germany, he knows it's a lie.
Which confirm other information.
For example, the famous poll organized Ard public television companies - the Czech Association of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to Ard wanted a week ago, more than 50% of the Germans accept more refugees.
It also meldovaly our TV.
The next day, however, something snapped in Germany: the right to vote in anketním Article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want immigrants - votes were attended by 67 000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, five years ago, said: "our efforts towards ́multi-kulti ́společnost totally failed."
Then she said: "Germany has given up the fight on a multicultural society."
"any such coexistence efforts have failed spectacularly."
In a country where there are four million Muslims, according to a strategy that didn't work very well with people from different cultural environments to live side by side without Spanish live here with us today, and we've been deluding ourselves for some time, that one day they will disappear again.
But that's not the reality.
A multicultural approach where we say we just live happily side by side, so this approach has failed.
Completely failed.
But even Merkel probably doesn't have the strength to go against powerful Germany and Europe and especially against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euroněmec Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, Member of Parliament for the SPD, the only one in the Parliament ’ s allegedly doesn't even have a high school diploma - Yes, it's the same in the EU Parliament, Berlusconi said that he would play the guard in a concentration camp, as he demonstrated again.
It seems, especially under the impression the last statements of German politicians that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
It should be noted that, to some, most European politicians, statesmen, these statements do not support countries that were victims of Nazism, are aghast.
What's happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who tried for years, at least outwardly, to cope with his terrible past, aggressor and killer of millions?
They are right, who say that, in the spirit of Germany's aggression to be the devil, superiority and violence?
He was right, the Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, when all of his strength velkoněmců stopped attempts by controlling the middle of Europe?
When he said that the idea of a great German destroy Germany?
Probably should.
When it started out, preparing for the first world war.
The idea that the Germans and velkoněmecka led Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably in a different form.
After attempting to Marxists, for example, with control of the state, we weren't, and after the failure of the GDR, in Germany for example, ecology, which by the way, was one of the main forces of Nazism, began to develop the new German ideology.
We'd say well Sunny.
The German elites have long prevented the emergence of German nationalism, and so left alone all these fighters against an atom, enthusiasts looking for Paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi password our forest must live.
To satisfy restless young people all over the world want to do something different and better, to fully side with the warriors against the warming of the planet, nuclear power plants, etc.
And that, in this way, there is also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called propalestinský - and current antislovanský criminalising all Slavs in the difficult thing - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after Parents, a Jew, was mainly German Nationalist.
And also, as shown by the latest statements by Schulze and German minstrů openly defying threatening eastern states, the idea of a leader of Germany.
That must be without obey.
Otherwise woe betide you!
And if we bring that immigrants are very impressionable group of voters, we have what we have.
And it is, as always, the capital, in particular, the German who is comfortable and who benefit from the fact that Germany actually via banks and Union control most of the States of Europe.
Pseudovíra sluníčkářů first introduced the German into the swamps and ekologismu multiklturalismu and today brought home to them and maybe even bring millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by the sound of the sirens, soon to hit the wall of reality, which Merkel wants to see, and they begin to rebel.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbors by force, again, may be part of its people - but, it seems, still less part of the mind gets addled - ideologically, but eventually it catches up with the reality, as always.
Germany will burn again?
Muslim quarters already burning.
What does the German government to launch a public protest of the Germans against the incoming Islamists?
Who will come to the aid of Muslims already living in Germany for a long time, but certainly not asimilovaní, to local customs and laws?
What does the German Government, to get into a fight, the incoming Islamo-fascists hyphenated Muslims and Germans fear the Islamisation of their country?
What does that do to the Germans, and even with Germany, when they pick up people who will loudly and publicly to protest against a new Muslim euro-nadčlověku?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict, which triggered in Europe by promoting sluníčkářské ideology, ideology, elitist and, in principle, the totalitarian, and their greedy banks, is growing.
And the omission of action against the dissenting democratic Germans and all the underprivileged and riotous Eastern neighbours can't turn out well.
Completion of tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the pushy salesmen: scare them to death.
Just knock and robust knocker lashes out at you in a way that weaker nature doesn't just stand.
Animated title you off and make even hardened, the journey will take away (or, rather, will) the persistent salesman and a living sculpture.
A pity, perhaps, that the Speaker could not take in real life.
Even in the US would be good for staving off a lot of minds and scumbags.
Common růžkatý (OXALIS corniculata).
Small weeds that tolerates dry environment.
And so is located between the outdoor tiles near my place of residence.
On 16 September 2015 was photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to the expansion of weeds, but visually creates a good impression, as regards the flowering stage.
Outside, the tiles are located.
It's unpredictable, it is in our backyard.
She likes drier environment, it is easily adaptable, unassuming and low-maintenance.
Creates the leaves with a chaotic composition, but it's worth it to continue to observe and take pictures.
Under the microscope is the only beauty detail - the yellow flowers and green leaves with purple accompaniment.
Brazilian paediatric society Rio Grande, promoting a healthy diet during lactation
Brazilian paediatric society sprs came up with a shocking way to try to convey the information to women about the importance of a good diet when breastfeeding breasts by images of children suckling from vymalovaného depiction of junk food.
Human breast milk is made up of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide infants all the nutrients that they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to an excess of energy requirements is for pregnant women and first-time mothers increase the recommended daily caloric intake by 500 calories a day.
However, the new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only diet that mothers should drive.
A recent study by Robert waterlandem, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet of pregnant women in fact influenced the genetic development of their children and protect them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, he also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affect a child's immune system.
Seven's sunrise dominates rates, although nine's attempts to take the lead on the today show
Karl and Lisa Wilkinson stefanovice running in Canberra due to cover the costs of the consequences of the Liberal leadership spill failed to create a sufficient increase in evaluations for today.
Morning show nine projected from the national capital after the overthrow of Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull.

Jarryd Hayne had several options for where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his transfer to the United States, and a lot of teams have inquired after his excellent start training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim tomsula and it looks like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let sit Hayne for the rest of the season, because he made a mistake, which made a convert Australian rugbiové league in the first cut of the pitch during Tuesday's win at Minnesota 20: 3.
But tomsula has shown that he's got confidence in the players and given him another chance to come back and cast him into the game after the injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula was also continue to be honest in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing pledges ahead of the rest of the team, he was able to inspire them.
Tomsula also publicly backed Hayne at a press conference after the game.
Cam Inman, 49ers reporter, said Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator Thomas mcgaughey, who advised him to forget a mistake and he only cared about the next game.
During the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings jarryd Hayne make up for my mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start, in which Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hope in his NFL debut.

"usage has repeatedly called for it to proceed in the ordinary courts of restitution cases, so that any inconsistencies were not interpreted to the detriment of beneficiaries and that has always been the purpose of the Czech legislation, for their financial woes caused by the acts of a totalitarian state," added the judge.

Four people were killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into the crowd of protesters against the proposal for a new State Constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad dhakal, the chief District Officer, points out that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the police station, and some threw rocks and firebombs.
Mr. dhakal contends that the police used tear gas and fired into the air, before resorting to a rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, States.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused by the high number of deaths.
This confrontation was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the madhesi ethnic group say they have set up a new Province under the proposed new constitution, and lessen their political influence.
Further demonstrations have also been reported in western Nepal ethnic group of tharus, which calls for the creation of their own State.
From 10 August was the violent encounters killed at least 40 people, including 11 police officers.
When the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which was centrally managed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been going on since 2008, but legislators expedited the process after a devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers this week in Kathmandu to vote for the provisions of the draft Constitution and officials argues that the new charter would have to be taken by Sunday.
Certainly, right now we can't panic.
After the loss of the ice master Litvinova, you couldn't even domestic duel with hockey players of Sparta (3: 5).
Aren't you concerned about similarly disastrous entry into the big leagues as a year ago?
I hope that nothing similar will happen again.

For moderately overweight diabetics could be useful in weight-loss surgery
The benefits of weight-loss surgery for obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to tell whether the mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes are living longer after weight-loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"mortality data maintain the view for a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new studies JAMA surgery.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgery to reduce his stomach using different methods.
Reducing hunger and the limitations of the human body absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was carried out on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measure the relationship of weight relative to height, is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher suggests overweight person and people with a value of over 30 is considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
For their new study, the researchers used the min-sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data gathered from a study from 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and a gastrectomy - in medical treatments type 3 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery, according to the study, fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
In the meantime, left, who was not granted a BMI surgical treatment of diabetes, roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with diabetes were resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the treated group was compared to the drugs for diabetes resolved completely in only 1 per cent, and only about 2 percent of patients.
There was also blood pressure control, trigylceridů and "bad" LDL cholesterol demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient hemoglobin a1c levels in the blood, which reflects the continuous blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, noted the researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c value dropped from about 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the group treated with medication, however, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this "better glycaemic control" - reflected in improved levels of hemoglobin A1c -- to reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. chih-cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of surgery.
After the fifth year with the bypass group lost more weight compared to a gastrectomy (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), has achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and had a greater likelihood of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent to 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not improve survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from studies of people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona College of medicine-phoenix.
According to the Swedish study were obese people who underwent bariatric surgery, about 29 percent greater chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to the group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone's soothing outcome for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"it was here that such work is critical, because it suggests that surgery is safer in a group with lower BMI," without an increase in the risk of death or kidney disease, States.
Blackstone also maintains that the people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after a drop of the patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting for too long with the people we have demonstrated the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think once you get an accumulation of these genetic changes that firmly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the road back has been really hard.
"it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe is not able to accommodate all of the refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama has addressed the question of the ongoing refugee crisis in his acceptance speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama centre for compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that under the current circumstances, the interest of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
Also pointed out that the answer from western European countries, whether it was in any way admirable, the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the effort of Germany and Austria in the resolution, stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"to take care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you'll have to think about a long-term solution, a way to bring real peace and real development, in particular through the education of those Muslim countries," he pointed out.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force will never solve these problems, "he added.
In addressing issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also expressed the actions of George Bush after the 9 / 11 terrorist attack, and claim that "violent reaction caused us uncontrollable chain of events.
After 9 / 11, I express my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the way to solve this problem, not the violent path.
I know that his motives were good, but he used his strength to create unexpected consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.

A glass of whiskey, you also left lying around, but people these sanitation means they let out, and when they were children, it's a quick trip to the consumption of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a 6-year-old girl, who recently took four gulps in school when sanitation agents with the scent of strawberries and was rushed to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was more than twice the .179, which is considered the threshold for drunk in an adult, according to Dr Chris ritcheyho, emergency doctor who cared for her in the Gwinnett medical center outside of Atlanta.
She slurred words nhaijah and wasn't able to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital, for any signs of brain trauma, because a girl for alcohol, she fell and hit her head, Ritchey points out.
"it was very scary," said Scott, the mother of CNN ortoria nhaijah.
It could be fatal for my child.
Lopez suggested parents and teachers use alcohol-free products or arrange for them to be sanitation means out of reach of children.
Outside of alcohol poisoning were some sanitation facilities associated with death.
In 2013, the two women are from Ontario after swallowing the sanitation of the device, which contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The medics believed that the product contains methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three students in the fourth grade in northern New York planned to poison their "bad" teachers the stationing of antibacterial products around the room, "according to the police report.
The teacher is extremely allergic to sanitation and banned their presence in the room.
Police foiled the plan as "innocent chit-chat," and referred to the discipline of the school district,

Why I was witness to executions in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I'll watch the killing of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't come to that, I'll sit in the viewing gallery, the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and see Richard glossipa, who will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me if I was one of the four officials, who witnessed his death.
As soon as I received the invitation in January through his best friend and even though I was so shocked, I agreed.
As the days get closer, I'm starting to get worried.
Why do it then?
I accepted the invitation, because I think that's a good way to be able to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
They offered me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because it is often more applications than positions, the morbid lottery that will decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, it will be to watch the execution.
I can't do it.
I'll sit side by side with closest friends Richard glossipa and I made him a special bond through months of phone calls, and one of the two and a half hour visit.
I like this guy.
Often, we laugh, we talk.
Prison service says he cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, I'm compromising his impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he would like that, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "it could be better," but still thinks that what I do is wrong.
Richard glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if it did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him that I may at any time remove from the witness list.
But he wants an international journalist who will be on the spot ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help practices against the death penalty.
Kim bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, it will be by my side.
If you want to know more information about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I created.
I won't be here again all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van treese would make him guilty of being an accessory to the crime.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that the murder of an innocent man.
I absolutely believe that it had not provided sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion the execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will follow his death.
I can't say I'll be truly objective.
For this purpose, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is to experience what it's like to see a man I like, to die a meaningless death.
The man escaped from the canning river after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he rescued a man from the canning River.
A man from petrhu that runs the police, came out after he got into the shallow, muddy water just feet from the officers, who tried to persuade him gently back to shore.
Police from Canning Vale was summoned over the incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.

But he didn't get far.
"he was standing in the water and said" I'm not going out just to take me, "said Sergeant shandell castledine.
Constable Lachlan perhavec just didn't want to get wet uniforms, tried to use safer tactics and that police negotiations. "
"sometimes people do funny things when trying to escape," says castledine.

Peter Moody says organisers tried to spy on him and at the end of the race
Peter Moody accused racing Victoria stewards that he tried to get a spy into the stable last year and threatened to stop racing.
He focused on the stewards and racing Victoria integrity department and based on the belief that they have a personal campaign against him with a late scratch lady tatai during maintenance on race day, which for him on Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in a difficult situation, as regards lidarin positive swab to cobalt, which he can't explain.
He bit his tongue on charges of espionage for 18 months and didn't want it to look like a "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about the fact that I'm sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it comes from you all at once," said Moody.
They know that it went on.
Sometimes react and you have to live with the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Today, I go home and get a good night's sleep.
I want to go out with his head up and to the owners thought they were doing their best.
If they think otherwise, then I shouldn't be the coach.
I would then have to consider what I'll be doing my licences.
Moody's previously released his interview for the racing.com bomb that the integrity department attempted to spy on him.
"eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dale brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man whom I will call the question - and offered him a job in my stables for information to find out about things that are in my stables," Moody said on racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should show all of your information, because you have utterly failed in an attempt to catch me.
Robert roulston, former RVL Chairman David Moodie, the current president of RVL, and Bernard saundry, the current CEO of RVL, at that time, were aware, and are aware of it even today.
I should think that it becomes a personal matter?
RVL lets grow some balls and take people out of the coaches' positions they took responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
I'm all for this industry is bad?
I'm just really, really bad for the industry?
Maybe the people here think that it does.
Maybe I need to get my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them stuff to think about.
But I've gotten to the point, if that doesn't matter to me anymore, and that saddens me.
I'm really sad.
I'll push them and carry the burden on them to make a decision.
I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.
Coach's frustration levels increased with long-term investigation for cobalt including lidari and recent scratches made him feel he could "hours my license on the table."
Mood, most famous for the preparation of the undefeated champion black caviar, marked the rule on race day, treatment for "ridiculous" after he was injected on the horse a poultice of mud or clay, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
One of my team accidentally smeared mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday and it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treatment with poultices on race day, to which the organisers have already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who create these rules, doesn't know anything about horses.
"we all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.

Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back by rivals for wrestling
Melbourne storm coach, Craig Bellamy, criticized actions of their players as "agenda setting" two NRL premiership favourites.
Sydney roosters coach, Trent Robinson, said that the ref allowed the players storm "wrestlovat" his players during the controversial victory team storm in the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennett, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, he made a slightly veiled comment on the Strorm after his team won the final qualification over the North Queensland cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game a "parade" rugby league and, according to him, two Queensland weren't "too big" to Wrestlemania.
Bellamy surgeries defended his players and said that the focus on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation has increased his confidence, his team has been criticised because it's two leading trainers, which may mean that they have the fear of defeat from the storm.
"it still is - I don't remember that Trent Robinson spoke of the wrestling, when they beat us," said 24-2 in the center of the Bellamy.
I can guarantee that we have for the last year they haven't changed anything from our defensive system and techniques, the last few weeks, we just put so much emphasis on contact during the crackdown, and that meant to us.
Trent's here for three years and it's obviously a great team, so it's probably not used to losing, which for him might be a bit of a shock.
It's funny how these things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy to devalue the idea of Bennett's "exciting football" and reminded his mentor, bennetovův st george-illawarra dragons team that won the premiership in 2010, playing "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about the exciting football.
He was right in that it was the Saturday game as exciting as ours, it was also just as exciting, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George were criticized for the fact that they were boring team and Wayne said at the time that he could care less.
But now he has a team that can play the style of play, which seems the cancellation, particularly his young quarterbacks with their speed.
That kind of football you want to play, if you have access to this type of players.
This opinion in 2010, and now he wants everyone to teams playing his style of football - but not every team has two linebackers such as Anthony Milford and Ben hunt, so that's the style they play.
It makes me more confident, because they say those things, because they are worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, the US probably haven't even thought of, when getting to the big matches.
Bellamy also pointed out that in the storm and roosters fell more goals than in the game, the Broncos and the cowboys.
A game the Broncos team was likely to be good, I haven't checked, but what's the score? 16-12?
The game is over, 20-18 in our game were two more attempts, but it's exciting football?
Or are the breaks and neskórování attempts that interesting?
I think it's agenda.
If you refer to the US, that means that at some stage we'll meet again.
Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland or cronulla cownboys sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park, tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.

Arsenal Captain Mikel arteta says teammates must get behind the injured Jack wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
For wilshere, Wenger also stressed that it's still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason for him to play again at Christmas.
The best scenario is that wilshere would miss at least the next four games and, from the point of view of English history, his involvement in next summer's European Championships, is obviously uncertain.
A great pity this nnejnovějšího problem is that wilshere finished strong last season after an ankle injury and then back into the former forms during předsezóny.
"this kind of injury does not jeopardise his career," says Wenger.
It's a wound that needs healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or injuries sustained before.
That might be true from a strictly medical point of view, because Wenger has admitted that there is a risk of further injury, whenever any player returns during the season.
Here, too, there is a pattern.
A survey carried out by Premier injuries Ltd recorded 23 different injuries wilshera since six years ago, he had his video game Debut.
During the last five years, he played in only 65 league matches, arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective, for Arsenal, that means in six of eight seasons from 2007-08 was one of two clubs in the Premier League, who lost the most days because of the injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that improvements in recorded injuries during last season will continue.
"sometimes, when you're coming back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the competition," says Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body is stabilizing, I'm sure he does, and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal's campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb games on Saturday, with Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger prepares to rotate his team.
Héctor bellerín, Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, it means that Mathieu debuchy and arteta will probably.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Nacho monreala Olivier giroudem instead of Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and let the players need a break," says Wenger.
Even if Arsenal is clear favourite to progress from Group F at maksimir, Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating Stadium in Europe.
Dinamo also haven't been defeated in a total of 41 games, after last season, keep the campaign "invincible".
The stadium on Wednesday night, the earthquake shook the 3.2 degrees of Richter.
It was this year for the tenth time in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League when the capitulated against Monaco and he remains a distant hope, will lead the club to their first victory in the European Cup.
"this deployment is tremendous," said Wenger.
Arsenal: it never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
Friendsfest: comedy show, which gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The lack of a similar view in different show is striking, especially given the need for men to open up to more desperate than ever, as far as suicides among young men in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the biggest single cause of death for men aged 20-45 years in Great Britain and is three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address this problem, the campaign against living miserably (calm) year 2015 as the year of the man, whose aim is to challenge the culture that prevents men seek help in case of need.
At the heart of this fight is friendship for meeting this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students reporting symptoms of depression found that, in the event that the victim had a high enough percentage of friends with "a healthy attitude," their chances of recovery has doubled.
As for those who are not depressed, constitutes the circle mentally healthy friends half a chance on the incidence of mental health problems.
But to make the friendship work, must of course be achievable as soon as possible.
In that communication via social media, with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the Communication, the immediate response is often preferable to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives has doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even if we are in reality more isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values, our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And how long ago he explained one billionaire and game designer, more money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of the show friends was for him a source of this idea.
None of the characters weren't defined by their work, but their personalities shone through friendly interactions.
Joey and Chandler's frequent victims, while watching football on comfy chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that, yes, men can also identify with it, even though most of them keep their feelings for each other.
Kindly explain to me how one worker:... "my role as an audience of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed that even the tiniest friendly interaction can make a difference."
The men who contact us, often feel an inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends are one of the shows, which arise in my memory when I'm trying to offer longer-term compensation mechanism.
The small moments in a man's friendship.
As for my task, an outsider status on the line to help people in moments of despair, but long-term aid must come from a close network of friends and family.
So if you're planning on frendsfest this weekend hosted by comedy central station, why not take your friends for a drink in the Central Perk, where will the interior to celebrate the completely rewritten.
Or when you see someone alone in a Starbucks, just smile and say hello to him.
You never know what difference it can make your friendship.
"friends" will be broadcast on comedy central station from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for # friendsfest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel di Maria celebrates with Charlotte matuidim and edinsonem cavanim run over the wicket against malmu.
Angel di Maria scored in his debut in the Champions League and so helped PSG on Tuesday beat Swedish team Malmo.
Here's the report on the game, and the response to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in the Champions League final victory against malmu comfortable 2-0 at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after their debut in the Champions League and the player sent the French Champions PSG to victory, but after throwing away several chances, until finally upped their lead when Cavani scored his goal in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in the group and the team, and that's why Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, are not just focusing on the skills to the elimination rounds, but to improve their road to the quarter-finals, which recorded in each of the previous three years.
But even if you get three points, it wasn't a classic performance team of Laurent Blanc and Gilden ibrahimovic was lavish in front of the net and was later replaced by against his home team and the club where he started his illustrious career in 1999.
"in the Champions League is not easy to win out or at home, so does our opponents problems winning 2-0 and look comfortable in defence is a good start, even if there are things that we need to improve on over the season," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we have won, but I regret that we nevstřelili about one or two wickets more.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of three changes in the team, PSG, who took home this weekend draw 2-2 with Bordeaux in League 1, but he was in the fourth minute by di Maria.
The Argentine wing has been identified as the man who moves the PSG in Europe to a new level after his move from Manchester United, which took place last month, and he showed why, when he ran on a pass for defense Marc verrattiho Malm and beautiful finish sent the ball behind the back Johan wilanda into the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone starts it, expecting a big victory, PSG must have been disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in the play-offs, and got to this stage, with returned 9 International in the starting lineup and drawn five defenders and two reservists were tough.
But in addition to missile Nikola djurdjice, narrowly missed the far corner of the goal in the 34th minute Kevin Trapp, it didn't offer much in attack.
Instead, the PSG alone were an attack on the poor and miserable endings přihrávkami, which wasn't good even from ibrahimovice, who couldn't even shot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed, because his missile arrived at the site shortly after the start of the second half Cavani.
However, he showed a much more appropriate, when it came to the preparation of the chances for his teammates, and it was from his pass, when di Maria sent missile drill, which ended in wilandově goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of the game thanks to cavanimu, this line has already sent the Uruguayan heading for the sixth goal of the season after his pass after pass from ibrahimovic left wing from Maxwell.
That ended any thoughts about the possibility of Malm, might struggle to make a profit, and only a superb save from a great proximity wilanda dashed the hopes of David Luiz and the score remained unchanged even when the goal was střídajícího Ezequiel lavezziho unrecognized at the end of the game.
Malmö coach Åge hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, nor stated: "our last game in the Champions League took place in December of last year."
Since then, we just played Swedish League, which is not on the same level.
The qualifying matches is not good enough.
Hats off to Paris.
For them it was a fascinating game.

As the refugee crisis ripped through the Schengen area.
An emergency beacon was launched by Germany by far nestmelila European crew, but he forced the ship to change course, wrote to French newspaper Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the problem of refugees: will more likely be systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as soon as he sets foot on the old continent, particularly in Greece, than to argue for the sake of future distribution of refugees According to quotas on the basis of quantity, which increasingly away from reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said 25 of the 28 EU countries, to be reallocated 160,000 refugees, they changed the interior ministers of the Member States ’ priority.
Before worrying about the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who are arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already inside the Schengen area.
"the effective management of the external borders of the EU is necessary for managing migration," points out in the text, the Ministers discussed Monday in Brussels.
After the crisis, the EU is a common currency that is at risk in his next big integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but does not lose her determination, and increases the pressure.
Restoring border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those who seek asylum in this country.
Central power that makes it clear that, without it, there is no free movement in Europe.
It would serve as proof that Austria and Slovakia on Monday to join this action.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and even France are thinking about it, too, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary that was a long time ago.
This exceptional and temporary measures are allowed under Schengen rules.
That's a domino effect, but even a blind man can see.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, in the south of Italy and also in Hungary, for those who have already passed into the interior.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague, Thomas de Maizière about intensely acted during a private conversation with three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is tough.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics were already registered and identified with taking fingerprints two-thirds of newly arrived refugees.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory, because they fear more than the others, so on her shoulders, left the camps in which the refugees massed on its behalf.
The real black hole remains Greece.
On its islands near the Turkish coast landed this year, more than 200,000 people, which is twice more than arrived in Italy in recent years.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria, after passing through the crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge, gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil and they are waiting for a new government, his hands folded in his lap.
That's the starting point for the Balkan route and the source now common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
JUNCKER the Commission promises to introduce control points there as soon as possible, but did not indicate any number or date.
"the challenges faced by Greece, relate to the whole of Europe," agreed on Monday, European Union Interior Ministers on the mobilization on this front.
It is therefore in this country to deploy teams of the European border control agency, Frontex.
The EU wants to help Greece to extend its capacity for receiving refugees and to strengthen oversight of the islands.
"it will require adequate financial resources," warns the text submitted to Ministers for approval.
From the point of view of the law will continue to have the last word in Athens.
The real question of the creation of European border guards had not been officially filed, but Europe a close second.
The new emergency 'situation as it put on a back burner issue binding quotas and 160 thousand refugees at the beginning of the year, which raised the Juncker for the Commission and the European Parliament, and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They regard it as an attack on its sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, Monday was maintained in the text approved by the majority '.
But as a political liability.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only solid promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, of which agreement has been reached in June during the hectic EU summit concludes, Le Figaro.
