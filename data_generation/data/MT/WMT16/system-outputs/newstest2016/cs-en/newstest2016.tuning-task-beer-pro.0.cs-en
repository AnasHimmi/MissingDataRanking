When an emergency call the professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend
During the calls to the emergency line to his voice Professor Shannon lamb admitted to police that he shot his girlfriend, and it is necessary to come to their home.
Lamb himself, that his "sweet" Dog House was alive and probably upset, and that the dead woman's family contacts can be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on the White Paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back, I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me," said the letter signed by Lamb, who, according to authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles on a school campus, where police believe he shot favorite professor Ethan Schmidt in the door of his office.
The police chief in Delta State University Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
Lamb said the fateful phone call shortly after the emergency line.
Then came another death; lamb took his own life when police came for him.
The day after the school shooting, students and faculty, forced to hide behind locked doors, the responsible authority is still trying to figure out what the motivation was lamb.
The details, which the investigators published on the part of the State and the students and staff who knew him, and together they created the image of a talented, but probably a troubled teacher.
Students have confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt himself included lamb in the book, which he wrote, in a thank-you "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and history, together with 17 other members of the faculty, and many students took classes in both at the same time.
At the same time, inclination occurred regarding the problems.

Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that it was confronted with stress at the end of the academic year HWC 2014-15.
Lamb has previously applied for Delta state university for some time off for health reasons, when it stated that he has a problem.
And this year only taught two online courses.
The recent changes regarding the recruitment of University meant that a Phd on which lamb worked hard, he would be guaranteed automatic term to become assistant professor.
University President William LaForge stated that he knew of no conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. lamb obviously worried about something."
To answer these questions we have lamb.
After he left the campus, the police caught his foot when he crossed the border back into the state of Arkansas misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, the lamb killed jedinýmvýstřelem pistol at the yard house about a mile from his parents on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington State confirmed the coroner, methel Johnson.

Lamb started work at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009, and taught geography lessons and education.
In the spring, he got a doctorate in education.
One of the long-time friends lamb described him as a bright, charismatic and funny man.
Carl Hairston, she stated that the lamb was 15 and 20, when they met through mutual friends.
She was with friends in high school and he was this great guy who earlier tutored her for a few years playing guitar.
It was a heartbreaker.
Girls all heart softened as soon as he appeared, "said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in a suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss allegedly went together for some time.
During the emergency call, Lamb said: "I killed my wife," but the record of marriage never existed.
Had a dog named lightning, who lived with them in a brick house, which adjoins the cutoff Gautier.
The police said that the dog was fine.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O ’ Steen, said that broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"she was completely collapsed," said O ’ Steen about his daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
O ’ Steen said he met with lamb, but through his daughter Abigail to know that lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met with prentiss, When together with Abigail vystuopovali at a summer festival three years ago.
Random gigy later played together.
O ’ Steen said that his daughter is writing and singing his own music.
Prentiss, the nurse who was working for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender, and occasional entertainment coordinator in the julep room, a dimly lighted bar near Gautier, said he last saw lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, sweat, what lamb played guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"it was just a happy couple," he said.
We fooled around on each other and were a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humour.
Schmidt, killed a professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Allan Don Mitchell, a professor of English at school.
He was married and had three small children.

This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Girl herself for the Associated Press, Emily wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story has been amended to reflect the fact that the police are now saying that the lamb did call the emergency line after killing Schmidt, and although Lamb called Prentiss, his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.

8 electoral numbers, which show that Donald Trump in real light
Some tried to label him as a person, which often change their minds.
Others waved above as a joke.
And some are preparing for the implosion.
But some Republicans Donald Trump trying to pull down from the top of the polls, they're not (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead for a two-digit number, and some people are really starting to question what it means for nomination chances of real estate tycoon.
Of course, it is still only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of the year 2011 Rick Perry did lead the way for the rise of Herman Cain, in the end, neither of them did not win a single position in the nominating process.
There are many reasons why they might encounter in the general election.
But outside groups like super PACs is Jeb Bush and economic conservative group club for growth are aware trumpovu will endure and began unloading their dollars on the table in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent poll numbers, which suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
The evaluation trumpovo turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, monmouth university poll showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnate.
In mid-July it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
He now has six of the 10 Republicans to take a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are in the early stages.
Quinnipiac University after the vote, which took place last week, found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Donald Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN / ORC poll, which was conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans indicated that they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" with Donald Trump as a candidate.
Only two of the 10 reported that they were "outraged" of his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as trump (43 percent of people said that they would be "enthusiastic" against 40 percent who say the same of Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if Jeb Bush, the favorite to become the nominee.
Most Republicans see Trump as a temper problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for its bombast and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide is receptive to the idea that the real estate magnate has the right temperament for the presidency, according to Monday's ABC News / Washington Post poll.
The same number are holding senatorial club in the State of Iowa, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality of a leader, according to quinnipiac from last week.
Yet 44 percent think he has the personality to serve effectively, and almost six out of 10 independent says his temperament does not belong to the White House, according to ABC / post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
Putting on his učenecké hats, Republican voters think Trump is the real candidate.
On the question of who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was the best choice, according to the CNN / ORC poll from last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters in the past, the brightest didn't have a crystal ball.
At this time last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans selected as the winner of a Rick Perry candidacy against 28 percent for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.
Yet, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump as a credible campaign.
Even if Republicans had gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everybody.
Some scholars argue that a fragmented field is likely to contribute to trump's leadership, while aid is anti-trumpovská diffusely dispersed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But from the beginning of September, Monmouth University survey shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
Carly fiorinou leads by 13 points, Marco Rubio 14 points on 15 points, Walker, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, John kasichem 33 points in each.
He's in a race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead a trader over broad 19 points in a hypothetical match one against one.
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters argue that he has already made his opinion.
On Tuesday, the new CBS / nyt survey shows that just over half of voters supporting trump maintains that she will not change her mind.
It is obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that he never changed his mind.
46 percent of States that keep options open for change among the candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest opponent is the current outsider, his colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who regard their minds in the final, if they were twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans allegedly agrees with Trump on immigration issues.
Even from the moment Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech still holds and immigration as the central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that the bombast of Trump to lure key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and the damage of a re-branding effort.
But according to Monday's new ABC / Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans claim that agrees with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will also stay.
Frustration with the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are today roughly half the support from Republican voters, especially given their state of outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans vote in Monday's new ABC / Post claims that they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry at Washington.
Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa a few weeks ago, revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated Republicans in Congress, 54 percent is "unhappy" and 21 percent "angry as hell."
The House of Representatives supported a greater share of State charges for coal.
The Czech Republic receives more than $400 million.
The Chamber of Deputies supporting the government at first reading amendments to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of revenue from fees from open-cast mining of lignite Mining Company.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised members that, because they get extra money from the Treasury, such as municipal budgets.
The draft was criticized by members of the opposition, who fear that the mining companies won't want to sponsor the municipality as before, because they pay higher fees directly to the state government supported rozpočtu.sněmovna at first reading amendments to the Mining Act, which means, among other things, that the State should receive a greater proportion of revenue from royalties from mining brown coal from mining companies.
The State ’ s share will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will be reduced from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changing the method of calculating reimbursement for minerals that the firm mined.
The change in charges for the extraction of minerals is to bring to the Treasury about 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
On revenue budgets of municipalities have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee is to be higher.
In the year of the fees received from roughly 450 million kroner in the State budget, and 150 million kroner.
From brown coal mining was about 200 million kroner to municipalities and State 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the payment space with mining extraction limit on 1,000 kroner per hectare per year.
Income from these payments remains in its entirety belong to municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) members said that the municipalities that gain a year instead of $14 million to 100 million kroner.
The amount of mining fees will determine the law already provides for her, but by Government decree.
The payment will be calculated by multiplying the number of newly harvested the mineral and rates for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, is the reason for the amendment, among other things, the possibility of flexible reactions to the current economic situation.
MP ODS Marek Benda but warned that setting the fee before the government regulation may not be in line with the Constitution.
According to the Minister, but the doctor isn't in this case because the State tax levied on mineral, which is state property.
The fees, receive only mining villages, whose territories are affected.
In the case of deep-sea mining coal will get three quarters of the money municipalities and a quarter of the State.
The same ratio will also be the case for the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money, which the State mining royalties from selects will be ring-fenced.
For example, 28 percent will have to go on damage control, after logging, mining or to ensure the emergency services.
The draft criticized opposition MPs who claimed, in particular, that damaged municipalities affected by mining region.
For example, TOP 09 and Michal Kučera (Mayors), warned that mining companies no longer want to sponsor the municipality as before, because they pay higher fees directly into the State budget.
"it is not possible to tunnel in one of the poorest regions, only to the Minister of Finance, budget," said David Kádner (dawn) elected in Ústí.
Before the surge in unemployment pro MP warned KSČM aulická Han.
Kádner aulická and unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to reject the law, wanted to get back to government Kučera completion.
In the explanatory memorandum is that, according to the mining companies to increase fees reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent of the contracted in the long term.
The main consumers such as power plants or CHP should therefore not feel price growth.
"on the other hand, however, this increases the risk that mining organization will compensate for the increase in reimbursements to reduce their operating costs, which would mean, in particular, the reduction in the number of government employees," he concedes.
It is, however, an increase in fees from the point of view of employment.
According to the Rapporteur, the novel Milana Urbana (ČSSD) is key to members before the approval of the law knew the conclusions on the updated Energy Concept, and especially the government's decision about the limits on coal mining.
If coal will also benefit the limits, then it will have implications for the proceeds for the State and municipalities, he pointed out.
Urban disagrees with Mládek, in that the decision of the breaking down of the Czechoslovak army should fall until after 2020.
The CSA levels down, he says, should break it for social reasons, and because of the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Jolly will lead the Czechs as number one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear in the Davis Cup draw Thursday baráže in India on the board and this time each of them probably even hits in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil plans that, in view of the difficult conditions to spread the load across the quartet.
In Delhi, there is heat and high humidity, therefore expect challenging matches, which can stretch to five sets.
We need to take that into account.
I'd like it spread by the weather.
And whichever way it will look back at today's training, said Czech gladyou kumára khánny selection in the center.
And the world number one team with 40 counts George cheerful in both Friday and Sunday's singles.
The two are likely to roll over to Luke and Radek Štěpánek jelly.
I'd like to engage in almost everyone.
Slowly, I got it in my head, but I won't say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech lineup should be štěpánkova participation in Saturday's doubles.
Only question is, who will stand next to an experienced deblisty, who is in doubles in the Davis Cup record: 18 4.
It probably won't be happy.
Options with jelly, or Adam pavláskem.
"I really don't know who and how it will look," he said.
Decides to singles under development.
It may be an option, with cheerful Pavlásek surprise in the first round in doubles, winning over Australians.
"it's nice to play some doubles," he said.
Against Australia, I did it right, if I play, I'd like to show the same performance there, I showed from the second set.
"I'm glad for the experience and I would like to bring," said Pavlásek point.
Domestic singles to Yuki bhambriho (125th in the ATP rankings) who won a challenger last week in Shanghai, where he beat players ranked third and fourth hundreds.
Two will be somdev devvarman (164).
They are both players of challengerů and our experience in ATP Tour, but a lot of times we see that already in the Davis Cup rankings to decide.
"the present form, the weather," he said.
Friday's opening singles start at 6: 30 CEST and can stretch out because of the weather.
Rain is forecast and Kurt is not under the roof.
However, the play may, in artificial light.
I lit it and it has some two thousand Lux, which is enough.

The decision of Mr corbyna no singing the national anthem has attracted attention on yourself
A spokesman for Mr. corbyna said he would be "stood in respectful silence" and recognise that "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of the Shadow Cabinet, Mr corbyna Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that labouristickému leaders recommended that the national anthem to sing "notwithstanding" his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr corbyna top team, citing differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party had initially supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work also "add" following the appointment of Mr corbyna over his position in the European Union and the government limit benefits.

Mr Corbyn is the fifth leader of the Labour party, he faced David Cameron in the last decade since his election as Conservative leader.
The leader of the Labour Party, who promised a different approach to politics, he says he has some ideas "from the crowd," the questions for Mr Cameron and received more than 30 000 proposals.
Islington North MP claims that pmq are too confrontational and refrain from "how ready answers," sprocket, trade, and instead, he promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn argues that Angela Eagle, the shadow Business Secretary, will represent him at pmq, when it will not participate — like, for example, when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
Also dropped from the thoughts that he would let other colleagues to do it from time to time, because they had yet to discuss the matter with the Speaker of the house John bercowem.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said that he wants to depart from the Punch and Judy style of politics "," which was often associated with pmq, but a few years later, he admitted that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990 were seen as a key barometer of pmq, their judgement of the leaders of the house and their leadership position among other MP, although critics argued that became a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.

In the decision, the magistrate noted that there has been a breach of the law has not been complied with, because all the territorial decision.

Metcash's campaign in the country, to fight invasion Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IgA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Metcash's campaign in the country, to fight invasion Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers, and the first of the more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, metcash and IgA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build brand by IgA marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IgA retailers and suppliers to add brands such as based on dunsborough Simmo's ice cream maker tastings in stores and IgA store owners are selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League, local customers.
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defence strategy of 29 September, when sales of food, alcohol, hardware and celebrates its annual strategic investor day.
There is a lot at stake here, because southern and western Australia account for almost 30 percent of the Iga and metcash business steps generate higher turnover than metcash IgA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial and IgA stores are enjoying a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - in SA, more than 30 percent and 24 percent in wa compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
Anyway, as Morgan Stanley's analysts believe that Aldi have the snares 5 per cent of the food market in these two States during the 12 months since the opening of the first shops that have taken sales from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
In its report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom kierath, estimated that retail IgA could lose $360 million in annual sales and metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West during the next year, it will generate sales of 500 and 600 million USD in different markets.
Loss of sales of the volumes of food and the fixed price basis metcash would have cost around $13 million pre-tax on revenues, confirmed Mr kierath.
At the same time, metcash loses share of markets in the eastern states, especially to Aldi and Coles, although recent Roy Morgan research found that in Iga were most loyal shoppers.
Morgan Stanley thinks metcash food sales fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and its market share reduced from 14 percent to 10.3 percent in 2015 to 2020.
Last week a leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could be "highly likely to disappear within decades.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglass comment.
But it is known that a member of the Board of Directors of metcash Douglass contacted last week.
IgA's market share dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and earnings from the food trade, metcash, which supplies IgA, about 1,200 retailers fell by 43 percent from 2012, reflecting the changes because operational development speculation, sales and earnings are under pressure.
However, wholesale counterattacked and invest more than $150 million a year to supplement the regular price in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and helping IgA retailers again by adding to the rapidly growing stores of food and news from investors.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice, argues that the programmes and refitting stores increasingly price momentum and get caught, she hopes to return back to the basic velkoprodej profitable growth profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit for his behaviour rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became collateral damage during the recent fuss around his friend Nick kyrgiose and deserves praise for his behaviour rather than criticism, the President of tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a junior member of the talented duo, often referred to as a "special KS," Drew unwelcome attention thanks to her affair with the infamous kyrgiosem wawrinkou tent and the Montreal masters.
Soon after, in passionate qualification game in Cincinnati, had to be his opponent, Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison after the referee had separated twice, Harrison said: "he had one stretch kyrgiosovi wawrinka and I should reach out to him, too."
While he was last seen smashing a racket after he derailed a possible defeat at the US Open, Richard gasqueta kokkinakise staunchly defended Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where they compete with Sam Groth on the location in the second singles to Bernard romicem in Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I've been thinking about it quite strongly that, in my opinion, he was kinda dragged into the whole dispute thanasi," notes Healy.
You have destroyed the rocket, when he lost to spasm in the US, but it's not the first player who, because of the frustration of himself took his anger out on his rocket thanasiho. I know pretty well, and I can tell you at this event will not be proud of.
But I really was very good, because he was in the US exposed to circumstances very provocative about Harrison and so on, so, in my opinion, deserves great credit.
He's got a great team around him, he also has a great family around me, and I think that his treatment was a little hard.
It's a very grown-up 19-year-old man, he works very hard, and the team is great and so on, never had a problem with other players in the dressing room is very respected, he trains hard, he's in great shape, it's a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged according to their own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook kyrgiose for an important match, which starts on Friday, and states that the "mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports a native of Canberra to return to the team as a long-term star.
"first of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not at all the controversy that arose around him [kyrgios]," says Healy.
And I think Nick rose very quickly how Federer, Murray and others point out, people in the public eye is growing rapidly, also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight, when he would think about that, in my opinion, is the best solution for the team and for himself.
The European Migration Crisis: Hungary Declares State of emergency, closes borders and holding migrants
After the state of emergency announcement Tuesday Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia and held off those who tried to overrun its illegal to halt the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, hundreds of migrants while piling up in no man's land and the Serbian authorities have responded indignantly.
The ones who are stuck at an unknown time on strips of land between two States are those who are fleeing the violence in their native countries, tents and settling in.
But the feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter overhead, migrants call "open borders together!" and cursing the Hungarian riot police unit.
Some of the protest are refusing food and water.
Serbian foreign minister declares that it was "unacceptable" to the refugees were sent back from Hungary, while more of them arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, and not just an indirect harm.
During the next days will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries, "says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest maďarsko-srbské border came a day after a block of 28 countries didn't come with ongoing immigration policy at a meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to sharing responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in a surprised Italy and Greece, and talked with the hope of achieving the eventual agreement next month or at the end of the year, which EU nations have accepted more than 120 000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special European Union summit next week to discuss the refugee crisis, the Continental.
Their hopes, however, Hungary Junior ROTC at Brussels or his neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the road and speed up court cases dealing with asylum.
In the meantime, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania, to stop refugees who seek to transition over, when their country is now completed a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News' Charlie d'Agata korepondent announced that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped put barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary became the main weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom fled from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted, however, that most of them are economic migrants who are looking for a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, which is a look that clearly differ from other EU States, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalising violation of 4 a three-foot fence, which the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for a longer period in jail for those who illegally transferred refugees.
"because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we have the clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, the Parliament must still approve the deployment of the army, which is expected in the next week, but associated press reporters watched on the border of heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy bakondi, Orban for home defence adviser, said that the Authority was caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and captured 15 already within the territory of the State.
With the damage to the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing offences under the new laws.
Authorities quickly left to fix the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after they used a tractor truck covered with barbed wire.
At the main border crossing at roszke was a mess, because the Hungarians opened an office in the tiny metal container for processing and crowds of people.
About 20 of them could be in the thousands, but remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, when they refused food and water until they're allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton ahead of Bernie Sanders was halved in the national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton holds a double-digit lead in the race for the Democratic nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders gaining on her lead.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to be president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competition, the most democratic voters, argues that it is too early to say that they are clearly the decision about which candidate they will support.
But Clinton ’ s backers are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
From a CBS News poll from last month, Clinton lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and mitigates, but her lead is narrowing.
Her support among men has reduced dramatically, and Sanders at her loses only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under 50 years evaporated and now are equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has a big lead thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders among liberals in double digits, but now it is losing to Sanders in this group, only 5 points.
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support it only for that, it's a candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
I guess it's no surprise that are contemporary přivrženci Clinton because of her particular passion.
Views are mixed between those that currently do not support Clinton -- only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same thing about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Hillary Clinton ’ s supporters are asked in an open question, why do they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that he has the right experience (16 percent), followed by, that is, it's time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mentions her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It also cited the possibility of a big election and consensus on the issues.
While the Vice President is considering a potential candidacy for President, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would wish to face - a third thinks that she would not run.
When Democratic primary voters were asked whom they would have chosen as the second choice for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters claimed more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton ’ s leadership will spread out of 20 points, while Biden will run, 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning in the general election; but this number dropped from 78 percent from last month.
Biden is on a scale far in this second, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely zvolitelného increases.
However, when it came to the question of greater importance, the Democratic candidate, voters prefer solutions to problems before a greater chance of being elected.
As of last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, have good results in certain key characteristics between primary voters of his party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and he thinks they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden in honesty from all three leads, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same of Sanders (15 percent), but it has 27 per cent of this view.
Democratic primary voters also generally sees that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
For all those standards, about a quarter of democratic voters to Sanders has no opinion.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email account and server as Secretary of State continues, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of this matter, and they say that their overall view of the affect her at all.
But among the American public overall, it's a different story.
Half of Americans are dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on this topic were divided in March, shortly after this problem came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, compared with 36 percent of their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
It's all about the Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Despite the fact that Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy among voters her party, this question is still a problem among registered voters overall: just 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, which is a decline of eight points from last month, and about 15 points since may.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters think she is honest and trustworthy.
And at the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested in honesty best led Biden, Carson and bush.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with a lot of voters to Carson, he didn't mind.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson over Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest survey, CBS News / New York Times
The two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest survey and others for their support.

Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of baruch college freshman student
Almost two years after a student died during a fraternal přetěžovacího ritual in the pocono mountains in Pennsylvania, was filed murder charges against five men.
Brotherhood members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during initiation ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
The police stated that he was blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand, a total weight of 30 pounds and he was repeatedly harassed, when trying to get to the target across frozen fields.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of headaches and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity called 911 immediately after he fainted, and Deng allegedly waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, the police said.
However, they have found the time to change clothes, Deng Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the National President of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, said police chief Chris - at the press conference.
"in this moment they hide members gear and basically preferring welfare fraternity life before Michael Deng," stated chief Wagner.
Unable to revive him and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck by blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"too many families were zdevastováno due to overloading and at least one student bratrstvích die each year because of hazing since 1970," says Douglas fierberg, an attorney representing the family, dengue, in a statement.
Brotherhood and their members must responsibility and this is an important step on the part of the authorities.
Monroe County grand jury recommended charges of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault and criminal coming back.
"we want to hold not only the parties involved, but in the event that there is an organisation, which approved it, whether officially or unofficially, shunting responsibility also," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and national fraternity revoked its relationship with local branches.
This, with tents, when the Fed raises interest rates
Growth rates comes and bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy slides into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it would take and how long it will take.
For the economy, in particular, offers a little history on the timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first increase in rates and 86 lasted months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, though not always, in determining how the economy will respond, and financial assets.
This is the reason why the American central bank officials stressed strongly, so that investors would not be focused on when it begins raising rates, but rather the trajectory, how long will it take to standardisation.
The game is actually more variables.
In the end, however, may be members of the market to make sure that all this fuss over a speed increase may be exaggerated.
"the Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as' the end of an era of cheap money, '" he said in a note for clients Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we don't anticipate that a gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low, creates a seismic shock, which many fear might be.
It means that there will be adverse effects.
Here's a look at how they react to certain areas of the economy, on the basis of historical trends:
Given what the market has come in the last month, about the expected increase in rates could make the air a little bit unstable.
As soon as there is increasing, but the effect will not be so dramatic.
"it appears that there is a trend for stopping shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect LAGs in monetary policy," argued Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study about what happens after the Fed ’ s increase.
More specifically, the market for the last 35 years most often - about 14 percent - aiming to increase rates in relatively flat in 250 days (the average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returned to normal after 500 days, with the average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis, the chief equity strategist Bob dolla Nuveen asset management company, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the stock tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rate increases and the return of beginning to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but increase rates often help her.
The Fed is currently facing certain conditions that still exist, and which could hasten a recession.
The most remarkable is that the gross domestic product, close to its lowest point in the history of the Fed raising rates.
According to Deutsche Bank during 118 was raising rates only twice since 1950, the year-on-year increase in nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few expect him to maintain when, in the third quarter was only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta fed.
Raising rates in this difficult economic background could be risky and might occur, "the question of whether this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market participants were ready for the Fed ’ s growth all year and all eyes turned to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which was held this week and ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that at this meeting, the FOMC could approve the increase, indicating the likelihood of future trading only 25procentní.
"in our study since 1950 zvyšovací cycles were all still in the great cycle of increasing leverage with the recession with GDP peaks very quickly after the beginning of the recovery," it says in the report.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of these, when the Fed waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we're on 74 months and still continue.
Fixed income was also volatile, because the market is expected to increase rates, and the model is somewhat similar to what they're experiencing shares.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable for bonds than for equities, when the Fed will change the direction of policy.
For bonds, it appears that the proceeds are changing direction immediately after the arrival of the first cycle of increase / decrease.
At the end of a cycle of increasing bond yields fall immediately, "said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the increase in rates will cause approach yields between long- and krátce-datovanými bonds, which matched the curve.
High-yield bonds often in this climate, they work better, though, "we're still cautious about tightening yield in their analysis," said Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab.
What's interesting is that Jones thinks that the markets are no longer adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that prospects for the market to adapt to tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, firms which carry out most of their business in the US, win for an increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will be worse, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the area of the world market and their debt will also be larger.
"history shows that" quality "shares tend to be overcome during the three months after the initial rate increase," said Goldman analysts sachsve in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets ahead of the company ’ s weak balance sheet in any increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004, an average of about 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns to capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, lower quality also overcome their counterparts (an average of 4 percentage points) or 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of variable interest rates will lose most, Goldman said.
Beyond purely stock games benefited consumers also thanks to the US dollar.
Savers may also see their profits through higher yields, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the classic FM, claims MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "fertilizer"
Takes the view that it's increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rivals
Also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says that the British simply cheat

The Director General of the BBC, denied the charges on the grounds that the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival, in terms of live music and public education.
What I've learned about classical music on radio 3, I learned that on any other radio station.
And their commitment to live music and making music is, in fact, on the top level.
"I also think that the commitment to finding new Music Radio 3 and placing in service new works is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, argued the BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey, it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before, because the British are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was the only element of the production for the BBC came under fire for stepping on the foot of commercial competitors during a broadcast of the Culture, Media and Sport, and they got to the hearing.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked the musical talent show "The Voice" - which the BBC bought from a Dutch producer Talpa media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
You can see why this programme is discussed as non-original and not especially different?
Lord hall insisted that BBC one show in September - which stars Paloma faith aboy George as judges - was made "in a manner typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the corporation to "found a hit of his own stables" will start when the next time an entertaining series.
However, refused to rule out ordering more future seasons of the show the voice or spending taxpayers money on royalties to other entertainment formats.

In from the cold pressing seeds remain in oil all the healthy substances.
That's why these oils are appropriate as part of a health diets, for example, gall.
Some extra virgin olive oils are appropriate for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
Right you are, according to the Institute for Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic for several years, the most frequent cause of death of the Czechs.
Inflammation of the gall is mainly women, helping sesame oil.

Sesame oil can be successfully used in the diet, the liver which is very similar to the gall.
If people want to use all the health benefits that brings consumption of this oil, they should beware of goods from shops in exotic foods.
Producers from Asia often used for pressing přepražená seeds, which have a sharper taste.
So the oil but loses all substances described Ladislaus hačecký, executive director of Bohemia, Czech firms on oil from kraslic Sokolovsku, which produces organic cold pressed virgin oil.
The company also produces Sesame oil and roasted sesame seeds used exclusively white.
An hour can handle our press press 8 pounds sesame.
Mechanical pressing the material heats up to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for designation as extra virgin.
At higher temperatures would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil is good for diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
Czech favourite between sunflower oil is.
The research, led by Jarmila Novotná hamerské at Masaryk University, has shown that it prefers the warm kitchen, 43% of respondents.
In reality, however, the cooking is not suitable, at 180 ° C begins to burn through.
Is it better to use the example of the seasoning salads and convenient particularly in the diet, which helps to prevent cardiovascular disease.
It contains a high proportion of Omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which most of all the fatty acids reduce cholesterol.
Problems with the heart's need to beware of the overall amount of fat and calories.
In one example, a tablespoon of sunflower oil is 62 calories in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil is 99 calories.
As regards the energy value of foodstuffs, it is important to realise that they are natural foods with more nutrients than the so-called empty calories.
You are part of the industrially formulated products.
It is therefore appropriate to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower lasts just like sesame and hemp 9 months.
Storage in the refrigerator to extend the shelf life yet.
Old people know the oil in particular taste bitter.
On the contrary, the problem is not at the bottom of a cataract.
It is a sign that the substance has not been chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Hemp seeds are technical, and therefore to the so-called superpotravinám hemp oil is regarded as the healthiest of vegetable oils.
For this designation is the highest content of Omega 3 and Omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids your body can't make itself, and one must receive from food.
Particularly important is the intake of Omega 3 fatty acids.
Scientists study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that a daily intake of the substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece, on the other hand, consume her 0.6 grams of Icelanders take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil is appropriate to include in the diet as part of a diet support to strengthen the immunity and wound healing.
Has anti-inflammatory effects and is a necessary component of cell membranes.
People don't have to worry about the use of hempseed oil, does not contain any psychoactive substance.
That's the way to find this oil consumers, confirms the fact that the oil belongs to the bestselling Bohemia.
500 litres a year to sell him.
People often use one spoon on an empty stomach in the morning.
Hemp oil is not significant, but great taste boost immunity, said Daniel Vlcek kraslické oil firms of Bohemia.
According to the statistics, are the most passionate nation grilovačů Americans.
There seems to a household 1.4 grill.
All over the world, then held a variety of barbecue contests, which only confirms the success of the culinary discipline.
The Czechs are not far behind.
On the basis of consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that a mere 4% of the people in my life negrilovala.
The vast majority of the barbecue, and then a few times a year.
In order to be successful, we must not underestimate the barbecue is ideal preparation - Edit marinating meat several hours before the heat treatment.
That oil is the best and at the same time, the barbeque leaves health beneficial substances?
In general, the actual trial barbecue should conserve fat.
Experts agree that a large part of the oils at high temperatures begin to lose its flavour.
Healthy extra virgin oil, then comes the body of beneficial substances which of them otherwise we get during the consumption of the oils of the dishes at lower temperatures.
But that doesn't mean that extra virgin oil find barbecue in their application.
Grape seed oil for the barbecue, health and beauty.
When you say meat, experts from the firm of Bohemia kraslic Sokolovsku oil from the grape seed oil comes immediately to mind.
The LAG also supplements the wonderful taste of fish.
In the kitchen is characterised by increasing the unique properties of the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, because it has a high degree of incineration, when 216 ° C.
Even with such high temperature then, as one of the few oils holds the wholesome substances, describes the benefits of grapeseed oil from top oil company Daniel Bohemia, which is one of the few Czech producers of this oil from the vine.
Experts agree that grape seed oil is 50 times more potent than vitamin E and 20 times more potent than vitamin c.
It also contains high levels of linoleic acid, and is effective in fighting with an excess of cholesterol.
Grape in oil also takes our body important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favourable content helps reduce high blood pressure, increases the metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
The consumption of grapeseed oil also help increase our external beauty - improves the elasticity of the skin, it is used to treat acne and helps care for dry, brittle hair.
Chefs in the kitchen of grapeseed oil you use pork.
Not only is suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, the seasoning salads, but also for heating and dishes.
The barbecue can be used in two ways, when marinating and grilling itself.
Marinating meat and fish keep their succulence.
It must be present in the preparation of the marinade three components: oil, acidity and spice.
For example, the acidity of the cider vinegar and deliver to soften the meat.
Again, spice adds flavor the meat and oil, preserve and savor adds, "Daniel advises.
At the same time, it adds that grape seed oil for marinating is ideal, because as one of the few oils can penetrate through the dark meat.
Marinated meat or fish are therefore prepared to barbecue, how to proceed?
Extra virgin olive oils are characterised by the fact that in the preparation of foods are just a few drops.
The same is true for a barbecue.
Some of the oil for this method of preparation are taboo.
This concerns in particular the flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not at all warm.
Prior to the barbecue grill with oil to prevent light meals.
Barbecue is also an essential part of the preparation of the Annexes.
Grilled meat and fish goes virtually anything - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, a green salad, and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia oil they recommend, for example, salad, hot summer.
You need to: • 1 pack peaches • 1 bunch arugula • 1 cup sliced cucumber • 1 cup of mixed salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of grapeseed oil
Add the mixture to the salad bowl pulled arugula salad leaves, sliced cucumber and diced the big peach.
According to taste salt and pepper on me, you can also sprinkle with minced chili and soy sauce.
At the conclusion of a few drops of oil pokapejte grape.
For exceptional taste then you can gently sprinkle the salad of sliced almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it's not just the drugs but also on the will of the patient to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease with the diagnosis and the person needs the care of a number of experts: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, therapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
But it's not just about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultation, even if they decide to have a child, to care for these sick include social housing advice, recommendation, treatment etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient.
The more actively fight with the disease, the longer it can work and does not fundamentally change the style of his life.
Indeed, as doctors point out, the passivity of patients for the disease activity.
For example, it is shown that regular exercise significantly delaying the time when sick needs some compensatory aid such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their surroundings were not subject to various myths, such as that the disease is automatically leads to end up in a wheelchair.
That's page and give yourself a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaigns, give yourself a chance.
The most important person in the care of patients with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis pays twice the adage that the disease starts to heal rather sooner, the physician can influence things.
It's because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory process is not yet at the stage where neuro-degeneration, so strong.
The earlier we intervene, the greater the hope is that we can stop and delay the debilitating disease, explains Dr. Eva honey from a neurological clinic General University Hospital in Prague.
It's very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitative care, which most often addresses the weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
With the sick to work according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthening the pelvic floor, mitigate swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.
"it's very individual, depending on the specific problems of the patient," says Dr. Martin kövári, the chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic in Motol University Hospital.
People with multiple sclerosis may indeed suffer from the same disease, but each has a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation can't stop the illness, but always can alleviate her symptoms.
Physical activity also stimulates the immune status of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another encouraging sign of regular exercise is the fact that you are sick, what can handle everything, and it reinforces their confidence.
"exercise also releases endorphins, wash and they make you feel good," notes Camilla řasová PhD from Johns Hopkins University Hospital rehabilitation medicine Vinohrady.
The physical side of our relationship, we operate the limbic system responsible for emotion.
So we also directly into the psyche of immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"previously, the so-called saving these patients, we now know that they need a targeted burden," says prof J.R. Pavel Kolar, chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic in Motol University Hospital.
Physical therapy is in order, so you could stay as long as possible and self-sufficient, including the post.
That's why, working with physiotherapists ergoterapeuty compensatory aid for every person in the world to get him to the Garden of Peace.
Many patients need care and a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When you get a serious illness in my life, most people will shake it.
They're experiencing shock, panic, fear.
Must respond to a major burden - the loss of health.
With such aching souls have gone to someone, not to try to take everything on his shoulders.
"I work with them, so that it finally came to the conclusion that, even with a handicap you can live a full life and multiple sclerosis, that doesn't mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata raspberry - Schubert from the neurological clinic of the general University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague latecoere manufacturer Airbus would not fly.
Aircraft production is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technologies.
The new planes are full and solid titanium or lightweight composite materials, which are now so someone can't make and process.
Still, it's next to superpřesných, computerized machine tools, beside autoclaves for shaping the composites hit on something so mundane, such as apricot seeds.
In the drum, which recalls the pot on the cotton candy, in a pile of stones to espouse sheet parts, which just edges out frézovacího machines.
"no one has yet come up with anything better," smiles the Director General producer Ivan Dubský air door latecoere Czech Republic.
In campus in Prague earlier Letov Vystaviste produces a complete door for the Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world supplying the door for Brazilian Embraer 170.
The door, part of which is drawn up in Prague, also come in first and upper class passengers on the upper decks of the world's largest airliner, the Airbus A380.
They're installed here the door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the motto here.
Maybe cold-cranking keys leaves the company adjusted twice a year.
If the yellow sticker missed the Record Plant in Prague, they should explain what auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who rides regularly to check if the door produced according to agreed rules.
Human senses but not yet advanced technique.
On one door into the A320 is 1500 rivets.
You must shake nýtaři manually.
It takes them two days ago.
Even the sound of hammers to see if it's properly rivet flustered.
Tolerance, in which they move, they are minimal.
Rivet above the surface of the aircraft can go from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
When it comes to a number of trained touch.
When the controller over a finger after a series of rivets, it knows if one is out of tolerance.
Until then, she will pick up the exact úchylkoměr.
Letov fed before 1989 L-39 training programme for military aircraft.
But in 1991 he made neither one.
The firm had to quickly find a new contract.
Back then, together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
Won the tender for the supplier of the emergency door for the A321 model.
Courtship with Boeing were not so lucky.
"when we were a small company, which did not have enough money for investment and to Boeing could guarantee long-term stable supply," recalls the outcome.
The door to the American manufacturers would remain closed if Letov in 1999 delivered at the Prague Conference of the International Association of Aerospace Industries latecoere French group.
I was talking about our collaboration with Airbus.
The second day started negotiations with the French, says the outcome.
A year later, the Czech firm latecoere companies came in and bought a new contract.
In 2000, the installation started for the door of the A320.
Three years later, the doors on the A380 upper deck.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for processing composites for the delivery for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without latecoere ourselves to these big contracts.
Maybe we were doing small parts or components.
The partners want to guarantee supply for twenty or thirty years, explains the outcome.
Last year, the Czech latecoere reached 2.9 billion turnover over and profit after tax 147 million crowns.
An exclusive position between suppliers and aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague since 2000 has invested 1.5 billion crowns.
The company must have certificates of quality certification, 170 special manufacturing processes and certificates of qualifications for key employees.
Without them the company would make no door to the aircraft.
To obtain certificates that manufacturing processes meet customer requirements, and multiple checks to keep them standing under Dubský million crowns.
The production processes changed every year.
They are more accurate and more stringent.
We have the staff, equipment and doškolovat dovybavovat again the whole process to certify the outcome, he adds.
Now the firm is finalising the preparation process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the harmful cadmium for human health.
The award was received from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology for equipment or chemicals, which are used in Prague.
People will come from Boeing, the concept of the entire service.
Then let them manufacture.
Check our laboratory.
One set of samples to test themselves in his lab and then compare the results with our approach, the outcome is controlled, the way the customers.
Prague firm long-term reward are exclusive contracts.
The race today with the Prague production embraerů stands or falls.
For the A320 family generates half of the total volume of the door.
Replace latecoere Czech or European manufacturer for the Brazilian is either impossible or very difficult.
However, this does not mean that you can say the door for any price.
It's part of the contract price curve.
This indicates how many doors will happen after ten, fifty, hundred of pieces produced.
The price is still dropping to a certain limit value.
Into this price formula, we need to go in.
If not, we'll lose money, says the outcome.
Half of the lobby, where the electrical closet for assembling a military Airbus a400 m, is still empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen here is building a new line on the riveting polorobotická fitting doors and an innovative model for the A320 Neo.
The riveting to accelerate and refine.
"this is the trend, which the assembly in aviation is going," adds the outcome.
Future sales line is secure.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of new A320 model.
Just a couple of yards off line for a complete fitting doors for the upper deck of the A380.
It's a strategic decision our parent company.
The aim is to reduce the time of production and reduce costs.
The full assembly could begin within two years, says the outcome.
However, the company must go through before qualification tests needed for the assembly of certain electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is betting on further development of production of composite materials.
In addition to the Boeing should involve on the new Airbus A350, which will compete with the Dreamliner.
"it's a huge credit for the firm, in addition to the metal materials can also be processed composites," he says proudly, the outcome.
However, latecoere in the Czech Republic is on the edge of the production capacity.
Letov, located on the campus where, instead of the other is not.
Before the entry of the French company's 180 employees.
Now there's 800 and within three years there would still be a hundred more.
As long as they compete to Airbus and Boeing, how many hundreds of new aircraft, the airline every year, they order may not have a job.
Although he has a contract for several years, the parent company of the Prague latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group should have enough money for the September loan repayments.
In the end she could deal with major creditors latecoere.
At the end of August, the part of the loans for shares traded them.
Creditors in the company of a capital increase to €57.4 million share of 37.4 percent.
The debt of the company decreased by two thirds, i.e. EUR 180 million.
The second part of the recovery of the financial system came at the beginning of September.
The company has subscribed to the new shares to existing shareholders 222,9 million euro.
She raised a total capital of EUR 280 million.
However, the group benefited from the increasing production of the Airbus and Boeing, who are involved in 85 percent of sales.
The average expected growth of four percent a year until 2017.
In the book's custom orders for €2.6 billion, which corresponds to a four-year production.
French Media claims that latecoere, finally, after years in the VA can breathe again.
In Prague, the Czech race Vystaviste is significant for the group.
The group contributes 16 percent of sales.
According to the number of employees is the largest foreign branch of the group.
The deputies supported a greater share of State charges for coal.
The change in charges for the extraction of minerals is to bring to the Treasury about 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
On revenue budgets of municipalities have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee is to be higher.
In the year of the fees received from roughly 450 million kroner in the State budget, and 150 million kroner.
From brown coal mining was about 200 million kroner to municipalities and State 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in remuneration of space allowed mining extraction with a thousand kronor per hectare per year.
Income from these payments remains in its entirety belong to municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) members said that the municipalities that gain a year instead of $14 million to 100 million kroner.
The amount of mining fees will determine the law already provides for her, but by Government decree.
The payment will be calculated by multiplying the number of newly harvested the mineral and rates for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, is the reason for the amendment, among other things, the possibility of flexible reactions to the current economic situation.
MP ODS Marek Benda but warned that setting the fee before the government regulation may not be in line with the Constitution.
According to the Minister, but the doctor isn't in this case because the State tax levied on mineral, which is state property.
The fees, receive only mining villages, whose territories are affected.
In the case of deep-sea mining coal will get three quarters of the money municipalities and a quarter of the State.
The same ratio will also be the case for the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money, which the State mining royalties from selects will be ring-fenced.
For example, 28 percent will have to go on damage control, after logging, mining or to ensure the emergency services.
A draft today criticised the opposition MPs who claimed, in particular, that damaged municipalities affected by mining region.
For example, TOP 09 and Michal Kučera (Mayors), warned that mining companies no longer want to sponsor the municipality as before, because they pay higher fees directly into the State budget.
"it is not possible to tunnel in one of the poorest regions, only to the Minister of Finance, budget," said David Kádner (dawn) elected in Ústí.
Before the surge in unemployment pro MP warned KSČM aulická Han.
Kádner aulická and unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to reject the law, wanted to get back to government Kučera completion.
In the explanatory memorandum is that, according to the mining companies to increase fees reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent of the contracted in the long term.
The main consumers such as power plants or CHP should therefore not feel price growth.
"on the other hand, however, this increases the risk that mining organization will compensate for the increase in reimbursements to reduce their operating costs, which would mean, in particular, the reduction in the number of government employees," he concedes.
It is, however, an increase in fees from the point of view of employment.
According to the Rapporteur, the novel Milana Urbana (ČSSD) is key to members before the approval of the law knew the conclusions on the updated Energy Concept, and especially the government's decision about the limits on coal mining.
If coal will also benefit the limits, then it will have implications for the proceeds for the State and municipalities, he pointed out.
Urban disagrees with Mládek, in that the decision of the breaking down of the Czechoslovak army should fall until after 2020.
The CSA levels down, he says, should break it for social reasons, and because of the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
The time for a decision on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The whole world is watching how the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting in two days on Wednesday and Thursday, to make a vital decision on whether to increase interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists contacted by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve will take the decisions, now thinks it will stay dormant for some time, and still retain the interest rate in the range of 0-0,25 percent.
It's a historic event, because years had passed from the moment he sat down, when the Fed cut rates to zero.
The first time we're approaching a situation where the central bank might be able to get to the bar and start from zero interest rate normalization process, "says Angel ubide, manager at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The American economy has performed relatively well, adding to the recovery in the form of trillions of dollars to the State account creation and only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore less pink global perspective.
Markets have been warned to be prepared for the increase, but the circumstances indicate that he also sees a big chance against that step.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday, 20: 00 CET.
The shooter left a message at Delta State University
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend Monday in Mississippi - and later the same day, even your colleague - he wrote a message in which he says he's "Sorry" the first murder and that she wished she could take it back, revealed on Tuesday, and government agencies.

Stars who lost their mojo
The actor (left), on the slide with his son Redmond (right), has had a stressful few years.
In 2001, fighting leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months out of the game for a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of the right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this injury that left defenders left in tears and knocked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks that Shaw could be playing again at the end of the season.
Injuries caused by reckless intervention - Moreno in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw pushed his way into the area of PSF.
Nine minutes and was treated on the field was also needed an oxygen mask before he was taken to a hospital.
Van Gaal said: "he suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
Maybe tomorrow or the day after tomorrow will be taken and then further surgery in Manchester.
It's terrible - the boy who comes to Manchester in 18 years, it's very hard, but he's playing fantastic, and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he was also wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of therapy and wouldn't be able to play in the group stage.
I believe that he will play again this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli Mexican punished.
Van gall, indicated that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for themselves whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly surgery on both legs.
A tweet from the account, Shaw says: "thank you everyone for all their news," words cannot express how I ruined my road to recovery begins now and come back even stronger. "

English defender will have added motivation to recovery in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Coke, PSV coach Phillip, he said: "it was a very nasty wound."
If any player leaving the field with such injuries, everyone is very sad.
It's never the aim of our players to hurt the opposition.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in the match against Mexico, Van Gaal's Holland at the World Cup in 2014.
"it's very difficult for him, because his intention was not to hurt your opponent, and when you hear about the severity of that injury, it's not good," said coke.
I wasn't able to see this moment.
I just saw the ball, who was heading in the other direction, so it seemed that touched him [Moreno], but I haven't seen surgery on Luke.
In an interview for the sbs6 Moreno stated: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult it can be such a thing.
I feel very badly, I'm very sorry.

David Cameron certainly knows the better the Lorax?
This thing every parent knows: when you fall in love with the baby book, it doesn't take long to learn her almost by heart.
But it mustn't be David Cameron.
When asked to name the service providers, children's favorite children's book, the prime minister chose the Lorax, Dr. Seuss story from 1971.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on the website of the company supercamps continues: "funny, touching, and with a strong creative content, so I like to read to their children, because it was always the image or message, which I haven't seen before."
Well, except that in the following paragraph Cameron allegedly described books by elevator from the film of 2012, added more characters and details, filed a brief on the original text.
"in a walled town thneed-ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by complying with her wishes to see a real tree," content is a short book, which records an unknown object of love Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that wasn't enough, very suspicious text supplied Cameron reads like a summary of the film the Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database website, and begins with the words: "in the walled city, where all thneed-ville nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would meet with the plot of the book, where the unnamed young man hears that devastates local nature, trees, removing industrialista greedy Once-ler, who despite the protests, the cover loraxe crouched, mustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, so relatively few significant task got PR assistant, who never read the Lorax child 20 times in a row.
A spokesman for Downing Street indicated that the text probably came from the office of Cameron.
Supercamps confirmed that text provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam lyth was in danger, but the omission of England still holds
Compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England selected for this tour, it will be under me repeating 3-0 defeat suffered last time in a test series, not very likely.
I would also not rule out winning guests directly.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup, and also the collective thinking is strong; bear the scars of 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball, moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and emerging spinner, even if it is unknown to level the test series, represents the possibility of attack.
Related: Adam lyth dropped from England team experienced in the series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
Forget Adam lytha decision is a tough one for me to analyze, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests against two good attacks cost in challenging conditions and simple, but the harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, the names Joe root around, there were no question marks, which led to the announcement, because — and this I've already stated previously — players are their best'but.
A few other half-century and lyth could extend his series, but it had control over its own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, it's another opportunity.
England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position even though his performances were not completely 100%, and it doesn't surprise me; he's always been a team player.
The question of how much time he gets to test batsman, he is a tough nut to crack.
Lyth got seven caps — as well as Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance at home and abroad.
The only thing for which you might gripe, is that England has given first chance in the Caribbean — although Jonathan trottovi lyth was in the best form — but a wasted opportunity this is in the past.
Alex Hales comes and it's batter, whom I rate very positively.
It's x-faktorový cricketer, whom we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when we get on the field against 236 Trent Bridge, which made it a little bit.
He must at least be afforded the same opportunity, one given to his predecessors, but all this will of course depend on the overall lineup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, when moeen begins after Cook's side, which would have got the extra spinner while retaining four quicks has been raised, and I have no reservations against it.
I don't understand why he can't bat left-handed strokemaker and this man has already demonstrated that it is an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was the number 3 for them and there's a big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played their first 38 tests before his performance in 2001.
He immediately have accomplished three centuries and never looked back.
He comes into the team as a back-up spinner Zafar Ansari and when I had the chance to follow him, took me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics — gross on average 31 35 with the bat and with the ball — and see it as a ferry, but not a lot of spinnerů who raised their hands, and selektoři opted for youth.
There's a lot to learn on this tour.
Outside the team, it appears that England made a few changes, and smart, to supplement their coaching staff.
The appointment of batsman mahela jayawardenea, from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches can be a master stroke.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who bring rich experiences that have experience with all the conditions and all of the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part white-ball tour and will bring to the team so ruthless as energy, Spark.
I always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and as mahela has intellect, which can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, although they're consistent voices saying things that have been said before, sometimes they can lighten the mood and freshen up.
Collyho Durham teammate Ben Stokes got the day off, as well as a similar root got a break against Australia, and I have no problem with this Decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and generate selektoři timetable.
And you have to remember, as the players that their job depends on results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
Brexit campaign could win by 2017, if the economy starts to stagnate.
Half-baked David Cameron's renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with every day that passes without the genius of Jeremy's election "is that a yes or a no?" Corbyn to the head of the Labour Party, or the TUC on Tuesday to take up the whole situation around Europe.
Foreigners are also his corbyna faragese and Nigel.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained, as Europe is mired in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British egocentric agenda, dividing concessions and disruptive changes to the Treaty, which mostly didn't want.
At its Annual Meeting in Brighton with the TUC decided that even if they don't want it eroding social protection.
We could even call it a selfie agenda Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor goes to bilateral Summits or meetings in foreign capitals, they take a picture in front of the famous local monument, with or without the local dignitaries, and then returned home with the words that win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants the UK in Europe - European nezahleděnou "don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some myopic ministers and officials in some major cities to get to a point where we left them on the matter.
Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, is carefully balanced ally, but have been in power for 10 years and he wants to leave his post before it becomes wrong for her, as it has for too long continuous Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand and Kohl (14) (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
Also, his power is waning.
Poland may soon have the nationalist government on the right-hand side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how the selfie to help break the legs of the British people who could better invest your energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want to, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these may be planning ministers deliberately unhelpful remarks SNP style during the referendum campaign in 2017 the UK to accelerate the process of Brexit, says a friend.
"renegotiation" and "solve the problem Britain has nothing of value from negotiations."
Europeans know how to own injury can be predatory in Fleet Street, and how the EU oligarchs are skeptical of the press barons during the referendum, because they weren't inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973, in a ratio of 2: 1.
You may vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, dishonest euro-oportunistu, who made his name as a Brussels EU Rapporteur "straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his vanity Ed Miliband knew its enemies.
Include a mixture of taxes, non-payment of ruffians foreigners hackujících phones and pseudo nezámořské departments, which owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, about Tony Blair thought the same thing, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a gorilla, her desperate need to throw bananas, you gave in to dinner and then to tea.
In fact, he was more like a Blair than Miliband, Blair himself, when he said Cameron ’ s referendové routine, since Blair admitted the EU Constitution repealed, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and acquired his card being fired.
The press never forgave him, too.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who on Monday in Westminster a friendly pat on the back - I told him that he must not waste time on me - seems to be in danger of accepting boycott Murdoch Neil Kinnock strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of engaging the media, not me, but I'm sure with Andrew Marr, whose chair at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin official position vis-à-vis Europe, to put it mildly, is developing.
Claims that he wanted to stay in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the rabid UKIP tendencies and wild on the banks of the Tory's small englanderismu it certainly may proceed.
It's the same thing, "said Hilary bemm but no benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner boy scout couldn't bring herself to admit that appointing corbynovo abrazivního McDonnell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father fought on TV about his loyalty, without going too far and lost his job.
The game Hillary was much more attractive.
But to fight for it, to stay "in all circumstances" - bennina phrase - Apparently, McDonnell said it wasn't what he said, nor what JC colleagues and members on their private meeting on Monday evening.
Whether any sensitive background, an image that Corbyn wants to communicate - don't forget, he touched me - Discipline Reports remains important in broadcasting all day long and particularly in faith, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal, which are social media
Cameron is fair not to provide a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider aid workers party in referendové campaign for granted, as stated by McDonnell.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But mcdonnellovo corbynovo and basic equivocation about membership of the EU - in accordance with their economy, besieging Bennite anti-kapitalistickou past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion between leftist dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences is the central principle of the doctrinal bickering.
As with his rationalization on NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that the campaign to end the JC won't want - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their domestic masters.
Why should she spend political capital of Paris or Berlin - also have suspicious voters - concessions for Britain when it seems pointless?
The United States are already quite disappointed "the weak performance of the British military in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, and that even with cost cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded on Monday, the start of something called British influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise on electronic Review published by public health England
A statement by the government funded agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking, came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links with the tobacco industry, the researchers argue.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the criticism of the evidence used in The Lancet report on electronic cigarettes by public health England (Phe).
The Agency has published "Phe mezníkovou" report last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
But a few researchers questioned the robustness of the data and highlighted links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in The Lancet last month attacked the "extremely weak" on the base, which the Agency Phe based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ, disputed the claim, which was supposedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "the basic principle is that public health policy should be based on evidence of efficacy."
They indicate that the general public might expect that Phe's claim that the Agency is "the current best estimate is that the e-cig are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one of the 12 people meeting convened to develop multi-kritéria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their views on damages associated with the different products containing nicotine; the results were summarized in a research report.
McKee and capewell points out that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called euroswiss health whose CEO allegedly has previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent study.
Also endorsed the credentials of public health, bat in the sustainability report states.
One of the participants in the meeting 12 admitted funding from a manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but no financing, which reportedly earned previously from a tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for the selection of members of the panel is not available, but contains several known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of which also claim in the paper industry funding.
Some of the others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
Phe also attended the meeting in tobacco control.
The resulting report in this group "eloquently," "admits the lack of hard evidence about the evils of most products on most of the criteria," wrote McKee and capewell.
However, none of these references or restriction is not described in the Phe report.
McKee and capewell said that Phe claims that "so far, there is no evidence that the e-cig acted as a path to smoking for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at phe, said that the allegations in the BMJ have been answered before.
He said: "electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
Phe has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and what also displayed, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative risk compared with tobacco.
Almost 80 000 people die each year from diseases related to smoking and smoking cost the NHS £2 billion a year.
A clear emphasis on current evidence - that even if the e-cig is not without risk, are only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fill our national competence.
The BBC should end with EastEnders, says former director of Channel 4
Former director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as Eastenders and the voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programmes which are not made of other British television.
BBC criticised for her public service programmes, which will likely see only a handful of people, in the complex broadcasting times compared to his rivals "biggest rating show, and on channels such as bbc4.
After Director General Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said, he was trying without success to the connection with the BBC for six years, which he worked on Channel 4.
"I struggle with the idea that the BBC and broadcasting programmes that would surely have been broadcast rivals without the contributions of the state," Johnson said in the Commission for the communication in the upper house, as part of the discussions on the future of the BBC.
If you can keep your licence fees, which I'm not sure whether they are in the medium or long term, it should be a good idea to reduce the formation of at least as regards the other programmes, which produce or not.
The voice broadcast in prime time, because they want to gain the widest possible support in the future.
The idea that no one else would have him, it's a joke, of course, ridiculous and pointless.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programmes, which may be funded bezpříspěvkově.
The voice is one of them, another EastEnders, and, of course, produced on home soil.
Frankly, other channels for them I would have given my right arm.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting service.
I don't think it would in no way weaken the BBC.
Johnson, a businessman in the area who led the series, Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that they feel guilty about driving ratings, "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comment about the BBC's most popular show, which repeats the former Sky Executive Director, Tony ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC to sell a show like EastEnders.
Johnson said that even hýčkanější public service programmes the BBC "passes on bbc4, where the audience quite often cannot be measured, but its power and can argue when they embark on a mission to justify your £4BN income from royalties," but of course we are doing all these obscure programmes, to which no one is looking. "
It is broadcast at a time when no one's looking at them.
As for the licence fee to the Commission, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find regresivnější system about who gets the best value out of him.
Of course we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a very large sum, but for people, for whom £150 is a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much on the BBC so much, because they're not.
The former director of the sky and Channel 5, David elstein, who spoke before the Commission on Tuesday, said that the BBC should revise its meaning reithovskou mission "to inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that the BBC was now a small volume of production has previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take a public role model for public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, explain and talk."
On the partnership elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms, which was aired on TV only a handful, and connect with the commercial to reporters, you could see them all online.
Sonogenetika ’ or ‘ control brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound pulses affect the direction of nematodes.
Scientists bred worms with genetically modified the nervous system, which can control the sound waves.
Tiny nematodes changing direction at a time when they are affected by sound impulses, which are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses are working so that they switch cells genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists reported that these worms are a perfect example of the new methodology called sonogenetika, which uses ultrasound to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells and activate cells outside the body.
Sreekanth chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, explained to the guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - invasive procedure, in which the patient's brain electrodes that stimulate the brain lymphoma-specific. E.g. method is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson ’ s disease.
Nematodes on ultrasound, but usually do not respond chalasani found that reaction will be when it is placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
Find out how bubbles are intensifying ultrasonic waves, which then passes through the body of the worms.
Enhanced ultrasound waves operate in trp-4 ion channels, which are located in the membranes of certain cells of the worms.
He used sound waves to these channels open and activate cells to which they are linked, according to a report in the journal Nature communications.
To control nematodes chalasani ultrasonic waves, the genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain trp-4 ion channels.
Then, when he used the modified worms ultrasound, the sound waves were strengthened mikrobublinami transferred into worms, and where on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is much like optogenetice, groundbreaking instrument, which enables scientists to neurons on and off using light.
But chalasani, sonogenetika could have many advantages compared to the technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent to the optical fibre to the desired location in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate tissues without limit and be sent directly into the brain.
“We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target the human neurons and make them susceptible to temporarily ultrasonic signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological disease," says chalasani.
He added that its method of application would also found in the treatment of muscle cells and the cells that produce insulin.

Eight golden rules for student life on campus
11 years ago I moved to a 19-year-old college student as oblivious, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but now when I recall those tense smiles, which I resented - and numerous, lengthy complaints on the other.
Everything I have learned can be distilled down to eight simple rules.
Moving on to the rails can range from a slightly irritating after a totally appalling.
It's tempting to babbling: tell people where you're from, if you took a year off, what's your opinion on why "corbyna and frankly you don't love or hate Marmite, not just because people, it's just the yeast extract, hahaha, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to also ask breath - and interest in the speech.
It manages the conversation and help you find the people you love, and you, that you would be fun even if your eyelashes were on fire and they would be making a fire extinguisher.
Let people space.
Room people often change drinking on reception places, film nights and municipal public places, but they're also the room where people dress up and adjusting their underwear.
Related: don't even think about that, you started college and be in a relationship
Introverts in college are very short.
Your room should be a haven, but a lot of the tracks on the amended mimopokojovou culture, which is a friendly, outgoing and contributes to the lifelong friendship.
It can be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture permits you to say, "I love you and I want to continue our friendship, but I need you to leave, so I can get back to the energy I used to have a conversation with you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socialization - and maybe write instead of knocking him.
Speaking of: knock knock.
One kid in my dorm had a habit of that, if the doors are locked, it's invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with baking.
Because you started going to university at the top of baking mania, knocking on a stranger's door and show with plate upečenými cakes seems slightly less weird, less than "welcome to the neighbourhood, I made you something, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering home-cooked treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe it's all over, so that your face is assigned to the succulent surprises.
It is, of course, the fact that you're a decent Baker.
Wrong condensed pieces of flour, sugar and jams that will probably lead the others pretend to sleep, if you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is common crime on college campuses.
Of course the whole chicken theft is a crime, but it's a little bit of milk to your tea theft?
Check it twice with the owner of the milk.
There is a chance that, even if they offer you the milk inside the rampage.
If someone steals something, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little bit more mature than my roommate, who swapped my milk for the dishwashing liquid to punish thieves.
Now he's in jail.
You shouldn't make noise that distracts people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you are also known for people in glass houses.
A girl from my hall asked his neighbors if he could keep it down, drum and bass because there were 3 in the night and in the morning paper.
Their answer was to amplify the music.
When it finally fell silent at 5 o'clock in the morning, let them sleep for two hours and then let out loud his own music, locked the door and left on his three-hour exam.
It would be romantic if your future husband went to the same college as you?
And on the contrary, it would be awfully embarrassing if you mistook the roommate for his future wife, slept together, split up and they had to see each other every day, and it might also take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future husband, try to talk to at least a little bit with his groin.
The sublime moment when you realize that someone had left the keys in their unlocked room, there's a fine line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable lesson about their security and entertainment that they can never hide anything - don't ruin someone's room and toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door for them and give them the keys to the bottle with water, then put in the freezer - but they never do not stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva is looking forward to the twins, despite the uncertain outlook for the future.
Eve's been through some rough times already during pregnancy with seven-year-old vítkem today.
His father broke up with her, and to prepare for and raising the child was alone.
I dealt with the situation very quickly - I'm looking forward to the baby and I was looking at the positives.
Uncertainty and by being alone with a child, I tried not to.
And I'm sure I had hope that we are not alone now recalls long, Eva on her first pregnancy.
Then she met on the Internet in a chat room, older Vasek, they began to talk about their favorite movies.
Even with Vasek Eva vítkem brought home from the hospital, but in the role of my stepfather was too hasty.
"for a time, then pulled out of the programme, described in the documentary series" Eve four in 3.
The third series of Czech TV show theme is the pursuit of happiness at the second attempt.
Vitek care and family financial security, thanks to a part-time job to help mothers and aunts and big bailouts.
Even the prospect of responsibility for someone else's child eventually Vaska's affection for Eva spoil.
Definitely got together around vítkových second birthday and he now understands Vasek and also as his father speaks to him.
Although he has two adult daughters Vasek, fatherhood in sixty under their kids used words and also pays more.
Besides Vitek added another two years and I'm finally even twins.
"Vasek into our family into the kind of naturally, maybe even by the relationships that my mother didn't talk much," Eva thinks smiling.
Few places?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and ELA was born by cesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis of pregnancy in conclusion.
It is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which are then in excessive quantities are present in the blood of pregnant women and, in particular, the itching.
The disease is dangerous for unborn fetus facing death, premature birth, and the mother after birth usually resolve spontaneously.
EMA and ELA to Eva's Vaska born healthy and happy, even if they were only at 36 weeks.
Emičku placed in an incubator at the intermediate ward, where he works, and that her niece vaškova could take over and check in.
Elinka was larger and right after the transfer of the ICU room I had it in her possession, describes the difficult period after giving birth to Eva.
She spent 20 days in hospital until doctors nesvolili release with babies who had managed to reach the border of two pounds.
Children in hospital waiting for the weight gain Eva joy but it didn't.
"I was mad with her husband and children," recalls the difficult moments in the department the puerperium quadruple mother.
My husband and I thought about signing statement of liability due to, inter alia, necitlivému access to one of the doctors.
To that end, but there was no doctor Eva and released with the twins into a care home.
The stories of four pregnancies and births sends CT1 on Tuesday night at 21: 45 hours.
Large family can downsize.
They live together in a house not far from Prague, where Eva had to make do with the electric dvouplotýnkou and crowded conditions.
A house had increased, but Vasek did Eve gas stoves, joy is mounted to the preparation of food for the six people more comfortable.
When will we take turns nejůř, cab.
Eva is convinced that children, in particular, the perception of family and a pleasant atmosphere, and no size or shabbiness cottage.
For now, we're piecing together very well, better than we expected.
The worse the mess while he hides in a small space and kutalející babies are sometimes, but at least we're all around, smiling, Eva, who can find a positive side to every situation.
Vaškova lighting in film work is no guarantee of regular income.
That's why sometimes goes out into the streets as a taxi driver.
In his 60 years in the care of family finances and children physically can, but how long is it going to be?
"I realize that given our age difference that I'm the one who's going to support this family," admits Eva straight when asked about the future.
She'd like to go back to work, but even more tempting option her own business.
With four kids, I'm not a bargain for the employer.
If the worst comes to the worst, we can take turns with her husband, joking about a nice blonde.
Apple had a yo-yo effect.
For everything they can display.
Faster processor, a camera with higher resolution, stronger chassis or display of strength, it's recognition in a nutshell the priority recently presented the ninth generation of iPhones.
The two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6S and 6s plus.
The current trend for apple was that each new generation iPhone is easier than the previous one.
The only exceptions were the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to the previous iphonům.
Dvougramový weight difference to the detriment of the news was truly negligible.
However, it's far from being the case for new iPhones.
Compared to last year's 6 and 6 plus iphonům weight grew at the smaller model is about 14 grams of a greater whole, then about 20 grams.
On the one hand, no wonder the affair last year, bending in pockets, apple racked up considerably.
The news is so resilient chassis from aluminium alloy 7000, which also reflect the weight.
But the much bigger impact they have on her display.
The technology used in Apple's new 3D touch, which displays the strength they can touch.
It was necessary to display another layer of capacitive sensors.
So mass displays of new iPhones compared to previous generations increased by more than double.
At the smaller iPhone originally from 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of larger then from 19 to 40 grams.
The iPhone 6s is so used to display the hardest component.
Weight only 143 grams is then for this news achieved thanks to a treadmill, which touched on most of the remaining components.
The larger model is used, then the heaviest element of battery weight, however, compared to its predecessors.
Even in this case, it is evident that the biggest increase in the display.
IPhone 6s plus 5.5 "weight is 192 grams.
How much will the new display technology, will not take effect until the practical use.
The first users will be able to test it on the Friday, September 25, when it will be launched in selected countries, sales of iPhones 6S and 6s plus.
Oats are already the breakfast of champions, tens of thousands of years?
Grotta paglicci in Italian archaeologists made the discovery, which opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of modern human habitation here from different times, including murals of instruments, and so on and so forth.
In the stratum 23a, which is dated instruments until about 30 years ago but scientists discovered something very recalls, but what remains of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, the traces of oat grains, which obviously went through a process of production, so popular today.
In her first grains in wet, then dry today, get rid of the packaging, the so-called glumellae, then steamed and rozlisují flat.
Cave in paglicci were able to discover grains, which was apparently nahřáta or buried, and then he probably crushed between two millstones - suggests the use of at least two tracks on stones in a cave.
Scientists have therefore failed in its publication for the magazine PNAS demonstrate that the production process was conducted in a cave full of flakes, but the similarity is truly striking.
We have no evidence about how people could eat cereal, but the theory that it was with a liquid and perhaps even warm, of course, offers a completely logical.
At the same time, it's a very interesting document of how intensely people use cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If it is the oldest vločková interpretation is correct, the flakes were well ahead of agriculture about twenty thousand years.
New reporting stations transport undertaking in the city of Brno.
So I listened once again to report the names of the stops in the trolleybus: hnusáčkova, ghost, frázova, spratecká.
Of course, the cable car was a bit noisier, so reports a man ’ s voice was somewhat less intelligible than previously reported, when he stops a woman's voice.
A woman's voice is higher, so the noise of traffic is more recognizable than the deeper man's voice.
Although dpmb.cz argues that this anchor chose the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but I'm sure it collected from the studio recordings made in silence, which of course sounded quite differently than in the noise of the bus engine.
I live in Brno a few decades, so the correct names of all those zastávkek I have memorized, so I don't need this report, but the foreigners from elsewhere in Brno and for which they are intended, in particular, this report may be confused and may, where they reached the final by accident, then claim that this stop, should get out of the car, which was not reported.
Maybe he should get the choice - but better newscast anchor again - do it again, and this time, tinged with the usual traffic noise and engine noise, in which the speaker croaking in the bus almost loses.
We didn't have to keep listening to the names of the stations heršpice šmírova, or water, then dive in creaking šalině to which I transferred in VW.
I assume that my old ears had worsened suddenly so much during that one day, when the announcer stops changed.
Before that day I understood the reports quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the notes traťováka.
Not many people know this, but what the government parties were the biggest and brightest so-called comprehensive background checks.
I took the liberty to reminisce.
The bus was late.
I bumped into the Controller's office the moment he came on the radio, that's just seven hours.
"you're lucky, that you hit with Comrade Chief, came a minute before you, and it seems that's not in the mood," said the dispatcher, while I'm writing in a log book.
Thanks, I'll watch it.
Tell me that I'm going after the small counties revision of mechanisation.
It won't work, today there are background checks.
They are all shitting bricks.
What's it all about?
"you'll see," said the dispatcher.
Next time will be, too.
I ran out to the corridor.
Then the door opened and the chief náčelnikárny appeared.
Uptight, deadpan, in an impeccably tailored uniform.
"good morning, Chief, sir," I said politely, and quickly switched the two buttons on his uniform jacket.
"good morning," came the reply, and I quickly ran to the second floor, I realized I was cold, the ominous tone of old, he said.
"you're messing with me," said engineer Eva, an elderly lady, which I appreciated.
She said she was even demoted her chief than comrades.
They are vetting, and you get barely.
How many times have I asked, what are you a comprehensive review, but nobody wants to talk about it too much.
They tend to be once every three years, must the rest of them, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
He said, however, I see.
I pulled out of the drawer in the file periodic reports and with the phone.
"holcman, come here to me now," said the chief's voice.
What is that?
We met and now nothing... "I muttered, but no one answered me, each with just your thoughts.
"good day, sir, I'm here at your command," I barely omeldoval, I entered the náčelnikárny.
The chief was sitting behind the desk and a clipboard.
"comrade mechanizátore," he said after a moment, he lifted his head and still without looking closely at that paper, "your behaviour doesn't appeal to me."
He dropped the paper on the table, leaned back in his chair and stared at me, blanked the usual nasty, evil, and piercing.
I faltered.
What's going on?
Even yesterday, the deputy said that in the last few months in office I worked very well and is very happy with me.
The Chief did very well when he pulled me out of the squad on long-haul event.
And now this?
You realize you're techniques to track distance and that's all there is to it.
Such a greeting you used this morning, is simply unacceptable.
I stammered that using a greeting from my childhood, I was brought up that way and I don't see anything wrong with it.
The chief that was like a red rag to a turkey.
"you're on socialist rail and the only acceptable greeting is an honour," said the chief job of petulance.
And besides, you're still addressing superiors.
Once you say "sir" again and again "comrade".
But for you I'm not Mr. Chief, but the chief comrade.
Deputies are comrades, chief deputy chief traťmistři traťmistři are comrades!
Kindly remember that!
Excuse me, sir... sir, I salute you but... but normal civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... it's an honour and a job, or you know... comrade... I'm not in the party...
"it's not your priority, you're not in the cold side," said the chief, who had calmed down a bit.
Still talking about that.
Anyway, just remember that you don't subscribe to that chair up to retirement.
It wasn't good.
When the chief said someone, something that is not his priority, with the concerned it didn't look good.
He stared at me for a moment, cold, piercing and I said I'd searched for words.
It also annoyed me more than his condescending.
He was just a few years older and played at God, actually soudruhaboha.
A jovial, pompous, arrogant, authoritarian, as it suited him at the moment.
All to be even more.
Well, it's the chief.
Actually, not all, like him, the President of the party organisation, but also all straníkům nestraníkům, informally.
But the chief informally to many, especially those in which he could exert his superiority.
Right now, for me he full of shit.
I thought about my ass and it cost me a lot of effort for me to shoot him in the face.
But it didn't come back, I'd have to ride to the picks, let alone trying to do an official for railways.
What do I feed two kids?
And out of the house!
I was ready to cry but I controlled myself.
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
"that's all for now, you can go," said the chief of the audience and began again inspected the paper, which had been in the hands.
You called me at 11: 30.
Everyone from the office were already there and on what issues, and how they answered that, yes, that would be good.
Just jožin pointedly said, as was his wont, we can't all work out, because I would have had to do with his comrade chief himself, and there was no danger of that.
The word "comrade" pointed out, as if he knew what the old wiped me in the morning.
It was quite a gathering in náčelnikárně.
Comrade Chief behind his desk at a long conference table and other comrades, who had to decide about my way of existence or non-existence.
Cadre, President Roh, reporter from personnel officer for special purposes, something akin to the military, and Deputy kontráše, my boss.
And also the most important person, the President of the party organisation.
I knew him from the road.
A track worker podbíjel sleepers or pitchfork thrown gravel.
But also a former prison guard.
It was whispered that it wasn't any fun with him that day, I heard a big beast.
Tongues, they argued that school came in seventh grade, no more trade, no he couldn't.
And when they end up in prison, the Sunday-afternoon picks.
But yeah, comrade, comrade was forged.
The chief, he motioned for me to sit down.
My heart in my throat, nespolknutelná cone.
Read the opinion of the Committee on Civil cadre of place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two kids, and so on and so forth.
So far, so good, I thought, and I breathe a little better.
Then the opinion of the party organisation.
This reflects the opinion of the Committee, is the same person wrote both.
But then it came!
Parents are longtime members of the party, refused to appear before the Commission and, subsequently, a revision from the speakers, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked sharply at me.
Cadre noticed and stopped reading.
The chief indicated that he should continue.
Then it's just worse.
I was a member of the municipal committee of the SSM, and there I was obtained for the candidate of the party.
Regardless of the parents, who stepped out of the party, gave me confidence.
But I got married and a wedding in addition to the National Committee, I was also in the church.
I trust the parties failed in the worst way.
That's why I was deleted from the ranks of its candidates.
But it wasn't enough.
I had two children baptized, and even his mother when she died, I went to the church funeral, although it was the former.
Giving all this negative attitude to the party leadership.
If you read only the Chief's personnel manager, tapping the table with pencils punctuated by silence.
Everyone was staring at me and I wish I was somewhere far, far away.
I kept repeating to himself "communists, communists - SUPERMEN - supermen." what have I got myself into?
Why I stayed in the Smiths?
Repair switches as I can without some crappy clearances.
But now?
Railway official career over before it began.
To return to the squad?
I don't think so, I'm sure the chief me out for an hour.
"comrade, how were you checked here in the present tense silence comrade?" the chief issue on a cadre.
Well, according to the report from previous employment.
You have him here?
It was obviously not kádrovákovi twice.
Beads of sweat on the forehead, blinking nervously, as if he himself was prověřovaný.
The chief nodded and handed a piece of paper.
"well," the chief said with a hint of joviality, but which was often a precursor of a storm.
At first glance, nothing but praise, trained with honors, he graduated from college, he worked as a locksmith in piecework, filling in the standard, on average, a hundred and twenty percent.
But that's missing the point.
Where did you get that reference, comrade? "turned again to a cadre, who felt that it kind of starts to turn against him and that would very soon be kádrovákem perhaps didn't have to.
Comrade, gave it to me at the onset.
It was enough for you?
"well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to the crew," the cadre.
And there he was, his opinions do not require the sort of extra, so I gave it to him.
"so when you include the technical functions of this scrap of paper was," the chief said.
Cadre blinking nervously and didn't have the answers.
"never mind, we'll discuss it later," said the chief issue and kádrovákovi looked relieved.
For now, take it.
"what's the matter with you, comrade?" the Chief turned to me again.
Suddenly vyká me, so it's over!
In the eyes of my vision, to me that scalding hot.
Burst of remorse and accusations, and I knew it was the ugliest creature on earth that does not deserve the slightest mercy.
By planting an incomplete report that I misled comrade cadre examiner, while I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I received it from a cadre at the factory.
I also antisocialistický element, which at the time of real socialism, supports the building of religious obscurantism, or even participate in them.
That, that was a lot of everything that I've committed, or maybe even commit and I silently prayed for it to end.
I didn't care.
I was one of the places that amplifies mechanizátora.
I didn't care that I take the pick.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not an enemy of the people, which in my eyes was the chief comrade.
"that's enough, sir," said the party chairman and chief's levity interrupted emphatically.
This comrade made a mistake, a terrible mistake.
What right did wrong, stupid!
But he already got his punishment.
And don't you forget it, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse than for a young person, that we close the door on his time to party!
To be opened again, he will have to prove that he's changed, that is worthy of our trust again.
Uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did that come from?
She's so well-read or partisan parroted phrases from training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must get away from us a chance!
A chance to prove that he's changed.
And who does give it to him, if not just you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade, support in his effort to fix!
It's your duty to the party, you'll never be rid of it.
Actually, it's also party to all of us.
This comrade must see that side of him.
Like the kind that not only punishes my mother, but that she also loves.
When the president finished, no one said a word.
No one expected such a turnaround situation.
At least I do.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade Chairman," said Chief icily in an effort to regain the initiative.
If you'd let me finish, you heard that I was going to just such a conclusion.
They all nod their heads, but it was evident that he doesn't believe a word of it.
"so I was confirmed for the independent examiner on basic healthcare resources," he said when I return to the office and then I began to cry.
Yet all that in addition to the engineers, Eve were at lunch.
She listened to my incoherent silently makeup fresh experiences and I had calmed down.
When I finished, she asked whether the coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, put water on the stove and cups.
Meanwhile, vented about kádrováckých practices.
How one opinion, often full of praise, put into a man's hand, and the second, in which is of scum, they will send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to, but a Sunday-afternoon picks, and comrades from the factory, so they didn't know where to send it to.
And our cadre?
He's just old, where what he ate or drank, and so it turned out, as it turned out.
"it gets from the old," she said mischievously.
Today, he won't like it.
Anyway, watch out for him, he's very vindictive.
And party chairman?
In fact, far worse, no humanitarian chief.
Zero picks from having great power.
Boiled water for coffee, and then just bathed in the office was filled with the smell of coffee.
I dropped into a mug and a sugar cube, stirring potion hot in silence.
Perhaps I'm out of the woods.
Now another clearance and fired me for three years.
Anyway, my comrade chief today he won't soon forget.

Symbol of life.
Moose chlumem bike over after years of spinning again.
To see them from far away, because it is placed at fifteen meters tall flagpole.
People from a wide area they call him "the fan Chlum."
For the municipality to 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the character that the municipality acquired the natives opportunities reunion in 2010.
"we're pulling back then about character and the character of Course fan we want, everyone knows it," said Mayor George Masek.
Chlumské wind pump is local technical monument.
It's a bit of a memento: even today, recalls a time when the people here fought for good quality drinking water.
In the recent centuries the Chlum was rare.
In 1910, when councillors decided chlumští solution which suited then until the mid 1980s.
In a village at the mouth of the cave číchov left seven meters deep well.
Three years later they were joined by a metal structure with a wind pump water into the reservoir, which benefited from the highest point in the village, near the church.
"the construction of the border conducted by Anthony d Moravia cargo 2 400 crowns," says the inscription on the commemorative ground-level construction fence pole.
The pump after a few corrections and falls down a windmill in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, then began to write a new chapter in the fight for water: on this day in Chlum began to serve a new pipe.
Wind pump have remained only a symbol of a dysfunctional municipal and local oddities.
The dominant online earlier this year, at a reunion preyed.
When in 2008 chlumští decided that wind round again and again will bring into operation.
They produce a scaled-down replica of the original wheels - about half a metre in diameter.
The bike was fitted to the mast, that same year, however, have to be put down.
The manufacturer did not reply suitable material for a bike and couldn't resist the wind.
After several years of dominant Odlezelské jezero was dismantled under the roof.
From June this year, however, the wheel spins on a tall pole again.
On the occasion of the natives left reunion municipality replica wheels osadila edit him again and again and again to the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws water from the well to overflow shoulder just blind.
And over the summer it was completely cut off because the well water was scarce.
At least turned up empty.
"in the autumn then shaft the windmill from the suction pump in the basket off again," the mayor said Masek.
Chlum isn't the only municipality in the Czech Republic, where the wind got round to the municipal character, however, is the only member of this kind throughout the Highlands.
They have similar element in character in honor of the local technical monuments in, for example, and the Green Mountain chvalkovicích vyškovsku in Kuzelov hodonínsku partutovicích fantasies, on the shelf or in the vsetínsku.
No offence, but I don't know, she admitted lafatu rock Tripoli goian.
"the fight against match I remember very well, even as my goal, in all my career," grinned the 34-year- goian at the pre-game press conference.
Georghe Hagi coached us back then, it was too bad that we lost.
I hope I score now Sparta.
Except that this time we will not, "said goian.
This is the man who has played 60 games for Romanian representation, is a key pillar of the Greek team.
A shortstop will face raids Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people coming, no hell, says about the Greek duel Hybs Spartan.
And partly, he knows what he can expect on Thursday night.
I know well, who played in the Romanian fataie Astra with my brother Luciano.
In that time, I saw all their games.
I know it's a very good striker, too, which is why he went to Sparta, said goian.
Another footballer of the Prague club name, and then came the question, even if he knows David lafatu, best shooter in the history of the Czech League and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled easily and with a reproachful look he was aiming at Czech journalists.
Clueless expression on his face marked: "why did you ask me that?"
After a moment of silence, he said.
We saw some videos and I've noticed that a lot of Sparta, playing as a team.
He's got really good players.
And lafata?
No offence, but I don't know anyone else besides fataie.
The Spartans goianovi knows it very well.
"my experience of the larger clubs, you can tell he's holding asterasu defense, it's their game," observed organizer Spartan assistant Stanislav hob.
Goian has had the best years behind him, but boasts a very interesting football curriculum.
Its time to care for him, Borussia Dortmund - Stuttgart, Manchester United and city both units, but headed into the Italian steauy from Palermo, and played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're aggressive and unusual style, the coach says.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing The European cups, the Pere victory in the Czech League.
For me, it's the favorite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want the group to launch a good result.
Like Sparta, we try to win said goian.
I'm in the room with the Slovak goalie Tomas košickým who relish the opponent from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.

Test of objectivity in reporting on Czech Television migrantské crisis.
Another little test of objectivity and balance of the main Czech media coverage of the refugee crisis.
This time the main broadcast news bulletins Czech television.
And how did she pass?
When they are on the faculty of journalism to teach about how the media can manipulate reality, to be broadcast today, the Czech television event.
Migrantské crisis was dedicated to about 80% of the news broadcasts.
Except for the first minute, when informed about the riots on Thu srbsko-maďarské border and attacks on police officers are euphemistically called migrants they have run out of patience - they threw rocks and attacked with metal bars), driving the current promigrantská propaganda - the names of each story for you to judge.
Criticism of non-governmental organisations - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticise the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in Czech school story - Integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as an opportunity.
Wandering refugees - Thu consistently used expressions refugee or migrant and not a refugee.
What's striking is that the camera uses Thu ilustračních consistently and only footage on small children and women.
But in the same broadcast stated that, of the migrants apprehended in the Czech Republic is 80% men.
Summary: for the most part, propaganda, which is unprecedented from communist agitek.
I have to say, as a former journalist colleagues to shame.
Ecology in practice.
When I used to be able to place concrete building, I soon ceased to be the sole inhabitant.
I moved in on a Formica toilet roaches.
Domestic Silverfish, insects with incomplete metamorphosis, i.e., the transition from neprodělávající caterpillars on the beetle and cub looks like an adult, it's just a small and gradually rising.
I was disgusting and I took to it.
First, manually and chemically later.
Socialist drugstore at their disposal to provide a sort of blue crystals.
I think it was called Zyklon-B.
Or something else?
It is, however, successfully destroyed.
Later, I dealt with it with the Pharaohs.
A box with a sort of juvenalizátorem, who brought the ants to the nest, and then he allowed the queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went on, I became the object of my admiration and I am increasingly leaning towards the view that they have the same right to life as we humans.
Plus I took from the experience of life, that the interference in the ecosystem does not lead to success and a pest can replace the other.
True for fleas and bedbugs would probably not hesitate to worsen some karma by killing them.
At the new location with a partner we agreed that if we're not roaches crawling on his neck, let them eat in peace, renegade skin flakes, some invisible eyelashes and the like.
Their quiet existence over time undermine the spider.
It was the usual kind of pokoutníka dwelt on the ceiling, which in the long term.
We should consider that the lives of the occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only added to comfort us.
Because we lived for several years, we have found that mostly rybenkami and that their number was probably kept on constructing únosném condition.
Regular intimate contact with each need done, we discovered that it's a female.
We were witnessing romantic courtship with a partner, how about a third less carefully on the web is fraying the threads, not to be eaten before it reaches the hoped-for copulation.
It took about three days of moving and not to respond to our control.
Under the toilet bowl, where romance, we were next to the female later found the remains of dried male.
Then the spider long weeks, didn't move.
When we thought it had surprised us, has a number of small spiders, hanging around in her neighborhood.
Soon disappeared.
They were eaten by her mother, the work of scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
If she went somewhere else or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, popped back up on the ceiling.
True, slightly smaller, probably the daughter praobyvatelky toilet.
From the ceiling while warily watching our behavior and movement assessed under the toilet bowl as our non-aggression pact of friendship.
The numbers seeding rybenek decreased slightly again and spider in his normal activities to ensure the food.
A whole year to our ecosystem.
Our daughter has reached the age when the use of pot was a disgrace.
So far we have tolerated it, but eternal spilling its contents to us already.
We're still more exhorted her to use the toilet.
The daughter, however, found an excuse to maintain their habit in the spider, which is very well seen wiping.
We are talking about a spider in the house, didn't have any luck.
Crying and screaming to coerce your potty.
There was no avoiding it.
There was a moment when he had to, in the interest of the spider evolutionary shift, the boss's daughter.
It was left up to me.
He was captured in a jar and banished from the balcony into the garden.
I was saying goodbye to him as a friend, but I felt awful after so long together, as if out of a relative.
We assumed that the roaches will appear more frequently and start to multiply exponentially.
Wonder of wonders, a week or two, we wasn't there.
I began to speculate on the cause.
I was wondering if there's a spider that somehow, along the lines of ants li that the toilet is not so favourable environment for their existence, as we thought.
But then there were the first pieces of average size, and never came back.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their link with the spider must have been the cause, when you see him, he's hiding in some other place, and that the danger to them from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some sort of telepathic link with the predator and its rapid disappearance triggered an alarm response in them.
The more that no illusions about their vision.
Some light showed that shyness, but would respond to hand-waving or quick movements, it's not.
My daughter goes to the toilet regularly.
I think you forgot the chamber pot.
All that's left is to attract some spider again.
I've got his wish into the ether and hope for me after the execution, Jeanne.
Otherwise we would have to use the Cyclone b.
The Ten Commandments of Albert Einstein, which enriched the world.
Statements by brilliant scientists of the last century, apparently humanity never cease to fascinate.
He managed to dive so deeply into everything, that was always a figment of an amazing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the greatest scientists of all time.
The awareness of people in general and in particular his special theory of relativity, which describes the universe so far, preferably in a gigantic proportions.
Nor can we overlook his clarification fotoefektu kvantování or thought of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the mere hodnoty knowledge system and for many, it's a popular theory of relativity so convoluted that intimate acquaintance chooses, for easy comparisons.
It's not easy, however.
Of course it wouldn't be Albert Einstein, even if on this brilliantly found a simplified explanation: an hour in the vicinity of nice; it seems to be a minute, a minute in hot oven an hour - and it seems that's relativity.
I took the liberty of his famous quotes across the Pleiades select ten of these, which literally mesmerized me.
Intelligent people are trying to solve problems, genius is trying to do.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
The first one I'm not so sure.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove that I was right.
However, the only time can prove that I was wrong.
But it's a sad time, when it is easier to disintegrate an atom than a prejudice to destroy.
If the mess on the table reflects the mess in mind reflects an empty table, what then?
I don't know what we'll be fighting in the third world war, but in the fourth it will be with sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect him.
It is dangerous to know little and know too much.
If I had had an hour to tackle the problem, which would save my life, I spent 40 minutes in his studio, 15 minutes and 5 minutes of his analysis, his solutions.
The hardest thing in the world to understand the income tax.
Finally, I cannot forbear to Einstein's definition of success: the formula for success, and considering the formula a = x + y + z, where x is y and the rest of the job, is to keep your mouth shut.
The new and modern.
Hospital waiting for changes in Zlín region for $1.5 billion.
"it's an accomplishment, considering that this year all four holds in the black," said Captain Stanislav who was with.
Total profit regional facilities at this moment is about 32 million crowns.
The shares are mostly higher reimbursement from insurance companies, which are as favourable for this year.
This really shows that after years of poor hospital can finally afford a bigger investment.
In Kroměříž Vsetín Uherské Hradiště, Shepperton, and thanks to it coming to the edifice, which together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
A long period of time, especially when we're buying appliances, has ended.
Now we have to build new buildings, because without them, you can't do the high-end health plans for health reasons, the Regional Deputy Petr Nečas.
Looking forward to the changes in all hospitals.
Clients come to hospitals next year.
Vsetín now choose the supplier of a new internal pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
In addition they have scheduled Kromìøíž dialysis.
Uherske Hradiste wants an open central pavilion this year to build a medical, for around $200 million.
And zlínskou baťovu hospital waiting the long-delayed construction of a new central income and medical ward, which will need to be three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, it is the fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"for the whole region, patients and doctors, it's an extremely important step," she said, for example, to build the hospital director Vera prousková vsetínské medical ward.
A five-story building there is supposed to be finished in about two years and offer comfort and neurology, medical equipment for dialysis, new ambulances, beds, and intensive care unit.
Convenience for patients.
The changes, which will significantly affect all patients, especially in the regions.
The new building will replace those in which, for example, many patients lying on the floor in one room, must have only one bathroom, beds are nepolohovatelné, leaking windows and paramedics do not have adequate conditions for work.
"for example, our interna was built 35 years ago and now their life is on the line," pointed out while the hospital director Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years, because it will replace the seven-storey building modern emergency linked to income.
Doctors and patients will be in one place, all the more acute in new areas.
The same model already has a half-finished Uherske Hradiste.
Central reception and standing within three years will be added to the ward.
"we pay for the construction of the loan, and partly out of its own resources," explained the director Peter Brewer.
I own this hospital funding as the only one in the country can afford.
He still has the highest profit and loss are not even two years ago, when the hospital was dealing with almost Zlínský dvousetmilionovou loss.
"we have good contracts with insurance companies, an excellent performance, increasing revenues and effectively manage costs in the entire hospital," Jan vajdák list, which is in charge of the economy.
The improvement will be even kroměřížské hospital patients.
Within ten to fifteen years will go to repairs and reconstruction of new equipment, up to half a billion crowns.
This year, he's already done the repair station, then begin the rehabilitation of dialysis, or the construction of a new building for an mri.

No one explained to me how I should be adopted to keep refugees in the country, if you don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan CHOVANEC (ČSSD) after negotiations with their European colleagues complain that the Czech Republic is pushing other States to adopt quotas to redistribute refugees, but refuse any discussion.
He also notes that so far, no one has explained how he had assigned to keep refugees in the Czech Republic, when we just don't want to live.
"we didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted to make the quotas were deleted from the final text," said inmate journalists.
More specifically, can you describe the position, you came to the meeting of interior ministers of the European Union and abroad?
We disagree with the mandatory quotas as a system that simply won't work.
We can't talk about migrants like bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings which have some vision, going somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues, how we're able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States, if redistribuovali.
We can't imagine it.
We didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted to make the quotas were deleted from the final text.
With other findings - functional hotspots, registrars, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we don't have any problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we say that this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Not long ago we talked about forty thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do you keep people on that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people who pass through us, wants to go to Germany.
Almost nobody wants to us, we simply don't know how to keep them here.
We have the ambition to go to other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as the destination country, receiving us fireman today, but in the interest of the people of this, the waves of migration from Syria and other countries is approaching, close to zero.
You mentioned that to us, but they don't even want refugees actually fifteen hundred people we've already committed to take.
Would it not be possible to adopt more of them in this way?
We have pledged to accept 1500 people, but with the condition.
We said: the functional hotspots, border control, military operation.
Even at $1,500, it's about 1100 people deal with asylum procedure.
They will come to our detention facility, and we will treat them the same as those that we captured.
The big question is, and we are about to debate with Europe, if we can detain people, who will be registered in Italy and Greece, possibly in Hungary.
Because Europe is to act, so that if they have the registration, they can't be detained.
That means, they come to our territory with the registration, and if it is an agreement which is not yet, it may be that even those 1100 hold on the territory of the Czech Republic, and they're coming in again to leave Germany.
If we can contain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, asylum procedure, we will deal with them.
Should the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, so nearly 98 percent, according to European statistics, receive international protection.
Then they get the documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think that these people end up once again in the target countries.
Then there's four hundred people přesídlovat.
This is the second project, which is still there, and the only progress we've made in that debate with churches, the possibility that they could help get them jobs, housing and so on.
But it is a very long haul.
You said that at a meeting of Ministers with us the other States were not willing to discuss.
But it's not so that the Czech Republic just refuses to quotas, but offers no solidarity step, which could unlock the discussion here?
And what exactly is that supposed to be under joint and several guarantees you step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany, that would create an incentive for all migrants from Syria so they can have access to them, the news spread in the hours after the camps all over Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another wave of migration, which is going to Germany, because we just don't want to.
We think that the protection of external borders - just you deter waves of migration, to help those in need, and to separate the economic migrants.
They clearly show that they don't have a chance.
Just last year, came to Germany to fifty thousand Kosovars.
Safe from Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of the State, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor ’ s office.
If we managed to separate them and accept them or accept only according to the needs of the economies, so those would be fifty percent of what social systems in vain for them today, they could go to the refugees.
On the first day, when Germany's introduction of controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic.
Now it's 80, the first day it was twelve.
Where it has to happen for border controls tightened?
We were scared in the capture of hundreds of people.
These are numbers that we got.
We still have a few hundred vacancies in land-based detention facilities.
Of course, all the people that hold them, we'll be back within seven days of Austria.
We do this by default.
The Austrians are the only us who these people are, with Hungary's complicated and Greeks - it's completely useless story.
Where is the tipping point?
It would have to be a grand a day?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two to three consecutive days we will run out of capacity, enough contingency plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister, that would immediately called an emergency government.
He is very concerned about the whole thing, we are in phone contact several times a day.
If this is the situation, the government can sit down and order a de facto one would immediately decided to reinforce the army, police, customs, or of the prison service.
The extreme option is a state of emergency, which now in some places declared Hungary?
I think it can't happen to us this far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state in Europe under the Schengen border, and we're only just at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen in order for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, rather suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the flow of migration to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route into Austria.
The Czech Republic that would have offended very marginally, at all.
Slavia paid off at the last moment, a large part of the debt.
He's trying to avoid bankruptcy.
Slavia football debts paid.
Even footballers get their money.
Slavia football stood for the first time on Tuesday for insolvency proceedings before the Court.
Almost three months after her for roughly 20 million kroner, the company applied for online services from Pacific Samoa.
Attorney Susan vamps Mládková tried to judge Michael wenzlovou during several hours to convince them that he has over slavií bankruptcy.
And, needless to say, had the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the week before the new owner vamps became a big Chinese industrial and investment group also cefc and Czech billionaire Jiri šimáně.
Obviously, since the new owners came in the club money, and at the last moment.
It also proves the vamps before Tuesday - vršovický club Monday, just a day before the hearing, the Court sent owed tens of millions of crowns.
"everything was between September 11 and 15 September paid," stated attorney Mládková vamps.
Slavia, who paid for that?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Czech or Slovak exreprezentantovi Milano Ivan záložníkovi ličkovi Maria.
Slavia also has paid the agent Alexander losenickemu.
On Friday the club pay the outstanding fees of Prague 10.
Part of the insolvency proceedings remain de facto only claims that the Abrahamic vamps.
According to the commitments given at either club or not, to lead the litigation.
However, we are prepared in the event of failure of those disputes the amount to pay.
"we have the necessary funds in a bank account, which can produce a statement of account," she told Judge Advocate Mládková.
"everything is paid in arrears," she said, and added that the Mládková unpaid or disputed are the only commitments.
Also certain is that, in the next few days and the judge decides will continue.
Match gave three weeks ago to send detailed evidence that actually paid the debts.
Subsequently, there will be an evaluation of all the evidence.
The decision can therefore be expected in November, as soon as possible.
The judge ordered the continuation of negotiations on November 3.
The decision, however, she will not fall at this meeting, but in writing to him.

Bianca was to build so poignant.
But it would cost about half a billion more, says an expert from a firm that was designing tunnel.
Bianca was also safer to mint, says an expert.
Blanka tunnel complex build, so it was possible to avoid two busts of soil in Prague, says the director of production company tree-man satra, which is the main tunnel, designer Alexander butovič.
He said that on Wednesday evening in the tunnel in search of journalism.
But according to him, it would have been about half a billion kroner more expensive.
Drivers opens on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between cost and security.
"the tunnel could make safer, but the costs are growing exponentially," said butovič.
Conditions in the park have been under him after the same thing all the time, yet the country fell just a few feet from where he started to make safer and more careful method.
"if this measure was used about 500 meters before the tunnel would have been about half a billion more expensive," said butovič.
Blanka tunnel during the construction failed three times.
Twice, in 2008, there was a crater in the park, in 2010, fell to the ground at the Culture Ministry in Prague 6.
According to company director George Metrostav bělohlava tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, EURO weekly said.
The structure was the original intention of the State 17 billion crowns.
When we add in the VAT, which popped up twice for the construction period, of the 17 billion have twenty-one.
Add to that a land buyouts, technology and engineering, indexation and similar items, it's 29 billion, which is no longer from the 37 again so far, said Bělohlav

FedEx profits mixed, reduce the fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in full-year profit forecasts because of low demand for freight and higher costs for the inland division.
The company also stated that the holiday is planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers.
In this period last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Shares of the company fell about 2.5 percent in předtržním 45 minutes before the opening of trading on Wednesday.
FedEx indicates that expects earnings between $$10,90 V5 and for the fiscal year, which ends next May, which represents a decrease of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an increase in interest rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will take effect in January 4, and higher bonuses for ground transport heavy or big packages, which start in November.
The company stated that it still expects profit growth compared with the previous year because of cost reductions, higher revenue, and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "showed a solid performance despite a weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing industry, and global trade."
Holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rivalská ups claimed that he plans to hire 90 000 to 95 000 extra staff, which is probably just as they hired last year.
In the quarter, which ended in August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is about 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share amounted to $probable, which is less than the $2.44 per share, which was 12 analysts predicted the Zacks investment research.
Sales increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been hit by the decline in international priority shipping, which caused revenue in its express unit stagnated.
But the boom in online shopping, FedEx results boost ground troops.
In the last quarter of the inland revenue rose 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same for higher prices and bigger packages for their own insurance.
The express unit recorded a higher income due to the higher base rates, while profit decreased in the cargo trade because of higher prices for labour.
Předtržním in about an hour before the opening of trading, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
Ended Tuesday with a decrease of 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the record of 11 June.
At its hottest meetings in years, lawmakers this week, the Federal Reserve will spend two days at 27 feet long and Honduran mahogany table will determine whether, after almost ten years the time has come to increase the key interest rate.
Towering above them at one end of the Central Bank, the two-storey design conference room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The central bank has the dual charge of the American Congress: maximize employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be x-faktorem in too close to the predictable decision, which is to be announced on Thursday, about whether the US economy is ready to run in the decommissioning of the unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rate in place since the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows solid growth of the economy, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the fed already cautious about adding to volatility by increasing its benchmark federal funds rate — and that's nothing more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"it is clear that the labour market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"but I think they were just looking for an excuse to not hiking rates, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives sufficient grounds to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed does, which is in itself a cause of nervousness on the financial markets.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Blomberg predicted an increase in rates this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed would delay a key indicator of business, with only about 30% chance of an increase.
That would have pointed to a decline in the stock market, in the event that the Fed will raise rates only if politicians promise that softens the slump is a further increase in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped about 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599,85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that the Fed will delay rate politicians this week in peace, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's capital markets research group.
"it would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates," It states.
If it's the politicians, the Fed did, "they would have to go to great lengths in the programme Declaration and hold hands, financial markets not to panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in rates would have calmed financial markets, because it would remove the uncertainty of how the Fed will proceed.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the Fed is on track to increase rates by 0.25 of a percentage point this month, the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions, which would confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that through the spring and early summer is expected to increase rates this year, despite the Liberals complaint that there is a need for more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed in August this year, the labour market, recorded solid growth.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
And even if inflation remains below the Central Bank's annual 2% target the Fed policymakers, argues that the main reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.
"the economy can cope with higher rates and needs is, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to struggle at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped to a record 16% below its value in May, when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy dragging down global growth.
The market rebounded somewhat in this months ago and now only the Dow loses nearly 10% from the peak in May.
The Fed ’ s policy makers the turbulent situation on the market, adds a complex calculus when to start raising interest rates.
"in the absence of that, what happened in the financial markets, and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. oliner, senior researcher, UCLA ziman center for real estate and a former Fed official.
Now predicts that at least wait a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"there's a lot of uncertainty about what impact it will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data on which they could rely on the latest developments in China," oliner said.
The health of the global economy is one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically shouldn't be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed became the monetary authority all over the world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years was enormous.
The mere suggestion of the then chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013, that the Fed could "taper" its monetary expansion in the market, triggered spasms throughout the world.
In a world where markets and economies are still closely linked, it can be expected that Fed officials also are watching developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central bankers and experts, the better to be able to read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary karabell, head of Global Strategy for envestnet bohatství-management Company Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "the Fed has history with exaggerated movements on the financial markets, which seem inconsistent with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, which pushed for the increase in rates, citing as an example the decision in 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point during three meetings "identifiable, despite the limited impact on growth in the U.S.," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials turned these cuts.
The Fed should prioritise financial stability concerns only during the Great Depression, as was the market meltdown of 2008, said Adam Posen, a former member of the board with setting rates by the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil to even come close to this level, said.
"you don't want to be in a situation of fear from the growth rates, because markets are upset," said Posen, president of Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate and mentions financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think he should get to the top.

On selected sections of motorway in favourable conditions, it will not be possible to increase the speed limit to 150 km / h.
So on Tuesday, when she came to the House of Representatives decided on the amendment to the Senate, which refused to increase speed.
Amendments to the law on the road now goes to the President.

On the Tuesday before ťok Members supported the Senate version of the bill.

The amendments also removed the possibility of introducing electronic highway signs instead of the previous paper, which will apply after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it saves money for the introduction of an electronic system.

Hungarian police officers allegedly released the dog to a refugee.
Then forced journalists to delete the footage.
He said the police at the Hungarian border with Serbia and briefly detained AP cameraman forced him to delete the recording, on which a police dog allegedly knocked down a fugitive.
But the Hungarian Government denies this charge.
The alleged incident happened Saturday night, when AP cameraman who was filming, Luca Muzi migrants across the cornfield near the Hungarian border town of Röszke crossing with Serbia.
Police officers stepped in against the refugees, and one of them left a Syrian attack dog with a basket on its nose.
The dog, a man who was shouting "please, please, please, please, I'm a runner," he says, men.
That all men filming, he noticed one of the officers and wouldn't let him leave.
The Journalist then could no longer even make a phone call to his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The officers were taken to a dark place muziho at registration centres for refugees and asked him to show them what is recorded.
Then ordered him to erase the footage.
Men came about as the result of the two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger, because they were dogs.
The AP sent a letter of protest to the spokesman zoltánu Kovács, the Hungarian Government.

The Champions League is unpredictable.
A win for city kick us, believes Juventus
"it's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of the city.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic game of the Champions League.
Neither team created a lot of chances, but we had more ball on his cleats.
"the cause of defeat, not just in the tactics Juventus scored two beautiful goals a game," said Pellegrini, whose team cashed in competitive matches after long minutes 636.
Last season's runner-up Juventus were mutual encounter exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, as the defending champion only point and with the score 2: 4 is up to 16th place in the table.
That is also why the turnover at Etihad stadium was the big surprise.
"emotionally, this win will help us kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Mestre, who had to deal with before the new year - the loss of the three mainstays of Italy, téveze and Vidal.
In Manchester, and is blocking pogba mandžukič Morata.
"it's so, this victory is very important, perhaps thanks to him we're going on a winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the offensive phase.
I think my players deserve this.
"we're balancing our goal before they could cash in on the contrary 0: 2 (no, but the US held," said Mestre buffona goalie coach.
"we burned several good chances," sorry Yayu tourého midfield, city.
We need to take the experience of the Champions League and try for a better outcome next time.
Goodbye, goodbye old Angelo Germany II.
Before we go on about immigrants, we should recognize that all the media frenzy around is managed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
And so let us pause for a moment.
Today news and media are full of babies, which are at the hands of their parents after the dusty roads of the exodus.
And it makes the man - the man - automatic European guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't come here just desperate children, note the footage on the landing boats to the Greek islands, babies on them is not so much to see!
Well, the last time us somehow disappeared from the TV pictures of ships heading to lampedusu refugees before the French border near Menton, whose beautiful promenade of thousands of young men.
Largely young black men.
Gone, too, and the pictures from Calais, where these brown and black men are waiting, whether they manage to get through the tunnel under the English Channel.
I guess it doesn't.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian Church Eritreans didn't do anything special for the people of Europe.
Much of it was disproved.
So when it comes to the quota for refugees, somehow, that it's not just the unfortunate children from Syria, but also about the styling - for older: vyfešákované fashionably - young men.
The musculature of which look like they've just climbed out of a gym.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish part of Cyprus - a Muslim - we lay on a private beach Hotel.
Regardless, it was a private beach, suddenly came to a large group of cars.
But no ham.
And young black men out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years ago.
They went to the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes in hand, otherwise, as smartphones.
It's a private beach, and caring staff - Turks, Muslims! - they are obviously worried.
Occupied all the deckchairs.
Who was on it and was in the sea, he was unlucky.
They were dressed as American rapperského film.
Hats on their heads with a fingernail, white and colored Adidas shoes on his feet.
Besieged the local beach bar and feasting.
Occupied tables around, stuff sitting next to brown and white guests bar - Read it Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers with children, fleeing the dining terrace somewhere in peace.
Incoming Smoketown drank beer straight from třetinek - both in the series, from the USA?! - on the beach, they threw empty bottles around.
Constantly shouting loudly at each other.
Of course, it was in English.
Then they also drink wine straight from the bottle.
They jumped into a hotel swimming pool in a swimsuit designer, particularly the young ladies - in the water, screamed and yelled, mothers with children and pensioners and ran away for half an hour isn't already on the beach or in a swimming pool or one nečerný guest.
They all disappeared.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter told me tonight in a low voice: "have you seen this baby, what they were wearing?"
"yeah," I said.
"well, it certainly wouldn't work," said the waiter.
I thought: "I know, I know, they all had a massive gold chains around their necks.
And the one he had on his neck, like a massive cross of gold.
And women were as jewelry.
"those are drug smugglers?" I asked.
"well, you saw how drinking," the waiter said.
Party drugs, even non-users.
They smuggle you something completely different.
So, it was clear to me what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105 still for me, it wasn't so important.
I had no idea what would follow.
But the Secret Service and top politicians ought to be the first to know.
I don't know.
To Europe in that time has about 1.5 million immigrants.
And they go and they come and they go.
Today it turns out that the European Union, the main problem is that politicians, intellectuals and totalitně-politicko-korektní like them linked to lobbying and economically important groups in Europe have the greatest power.
Germany and its politicians now publicly accepted the main power in Europe - they lie, lie and lie - not only to them but also the EU ’ s leaders and television, including our own.
For example, the recent television images of excited about welcoming refugees in Germany are at the level of the Moscow television images from August 1968.
Of course, the station was a few sluníčkářů, but mainly - staroněmečtí - Muslims greeted his fellow countrymen.
The long weeks of blather on the news on Czech Television, according to some research, as they are almost all Germans for the arrival of immigrants.
Of course, who was only a few days in Germany, he knows this is a lie.
Which confirm other information.
For example, the famous poll organized Ard public television companies - the Czech Association of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to Ard wanted a week ago, more than 50% of Germans accept more refugees.
It also meldovaly our TV.
The next day, however, what snapped in Germany: in the article that anketním vote showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want immigrants - 67 000 people participated in the survey.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, five years ago, said: "our efforts towards ́multi-kulti ́společnost totally failed."
Then she said: "Germany has given up the fight for a multicultural society."
"any such coexistence efforts have failed spectacularly."
In the country where they live, according to four million Muslims, a strategy that didn't work very well with people from different cultural environments to live next door to each other, without having to integrate live here with us today, and we've been deluding ourselves for some time, that one day they will disappear again.
But that's not reality.
A multicultural approach where we say we just live happily side by side, so this approach has failed.
Completely failed.
But even Merkel probably doesn't have the strength to go against powerful Germany and Europe and especially against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euroněmec Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, Member of Parliament for the SPD in Parliament ’ s, the one who allegedly doesn't even have a high school diploma - Yes, it's the same in the EU Parliament, Berlusconi said that he would play in the minutes from a concentration camp guards - again, as shown.
It seems, especially under the impression the last statements of German politicians that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
It should be noted that, except for some, most European politicians, statesmen, these statements does not support countries that were victims of Nazism, are horrified.
What's happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who, at least outwardly, tried for years to cope with his terrible past aggressor and killer million?
You are right, what they say, the devil is in the soul of Germany sow aggression, superiority and violence?
The chancellor Otto von Bismarck was right when all of his strength velkoněmců stopped attempts by controlling the middle of Europe?
When he said that the idea of a great German destroy Germany?
Probably should.
When it started out, preparing for the first world war.
The idea that the Germans and velkoněmecka led Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, will probably come back in another form.
After attempting to Marxists, for example, with control of the state, we weren't, and after the failure of the GDR, in Germany, for example, on the basis of ecology, which by the way was one of the main forces of Nazism, began to develop the new German ideology.
We'd say well Sunny.
The German elites have long prevented the emergence of German nationalism, and so left alone all these fighters against the atom, enthusiasts looking for Paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi password our forest must live.
To satisfy restless young people all over the world who want to do something different and better, to fully side with the warriors against the planet stopped warming, nuclear power plants, etc.
And have forgotten that in this current there is also strongly anti-Semitic - so-called propalestinský antislovanský stream - and treating all Slavs difficult scum - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after Parents, a Jew, was mainly German Nationalist.
And also, as shown by the latest statements by German minstrů Schulze and threatening eastern states, openly defying the idea leader of Germany.
That must be without obey.
Otherwise woe betide you!
And if we bring that immigrants are very impressionable group of voters, we have what we have.
And it is, as always, especially the German capital and who is comfortable on that Germany actually via banks and Union control most of the States of Europe.
Pseudovíra sluníčkářů first introduced the German into the swamps and ekologismu multiklturalismu and brought them home today and maybe even bring millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by the siren voices, soon to hit the wall of reality, which Merkel wants to see, and they start to rebel.
Once again, Germany can only threaten her neighbors, force can once again part of their population - but still seems a minor part of the mind gets addled - ideologically, but eventually it catches up with the reality, as always.
Germany will burn again?
Muslim quarters already burning.
What does the German Government starts Germans, public protests against the incoming Islamists?
Who will come to the aid of Muslims living in Germany for a long time, but certainly not asimilovaní, to local customs and laws?
What does the German Government, to get into a fight, the incoming Islamo-fascists hyphenated Muslims and Germans fear the Islamisation of their country?
What does that do to the Germans, and even with Germany, when they were up, people who will loudly and publicly to protest against a new Muslim euro-nadčlověku?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict, which triggered in Europe by promoting sluníčkářské ideology, ideology and essentially elitist totalitarian, and their greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the omission against recalcitrant democratic Germans and all menial and riotous Eastern neighbours it can't turn out well.
Completion of tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the pushy salesmen: scare them to death.
Just knock and robust knocker lashes out at you in a way that just doesn't stand the weaker.
Animated title will wipe you off even hardened, and on the way out (or take away) rather persistent seller and a living sculpture.
A pity, perhaps, that you could not get a speaker knocker in reality.
And the US could use to ward off a lot of minds and scumbags.
Common OXALIS (růžkatý corniculata).
Small weeds that tolerates dry environment.
And so is located between the outdoor tiles near my place of residence.
On 16 September 2015 was photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to the expansion of weeds, but visually creates a good impression, as regards the flowering stage.
Situated between the outdoor tiles.
It's unpredictable, it is in our backyard.
She likes drier environment, is easily adaptable, humble and low-maintenance.
Creates a chaotic leaves with composition, but it's worth it to continue to observe and take pictures.
Under the microscope is the only beauty detail - the yellow flowers and green leaves with purple accompaniment.
Brazilian paediatric society Rio Grande, promoting a healthy diet during lactation
Brazilian paediatric sprs company came up with a shocking way to try and convey lessons about the importance of good food to women when breastfeeding breasts by images of children viewing vymalovaného suckling from junk food.
Human breast milk is composed of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide infants all the nutrients that they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to an excess of energy requirements is first-time mothers and pregnant women recommended to increase daily caloric intake by 500 calories a day.
However, the new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only diet that mothers should drive.
A recent study by Robert waterlandem, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet of pregnant women in fact influenced the genetic development of their children and protect them before the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, he also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affect a child's immune system.

4 people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into the crowd of protesters against the proposal for a new State Constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred in the neighborhood Tuesday night in rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad dhakal, the chief District Officer, states that the more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the police station, and some threw rocks and firebombs.
Mr. dhakal states that, after the police used tear gas and fired into the air, before resorting to a rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, States.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused by the high number of deaths.
This confrontation was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the madhesi ethnic group say they have set up a new Province under the proposed new constitution, and ease their political influence.
Further demonstrations have also been reported in western Nepal ethnic group of tharus, which calls for the creation of their own State.
From 10 August during violent encounters was killed at least 40 people, including 11 police officers.
When the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which was centrally managed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been going on since 2008, but legislators expedited the process after a devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers voted this week in Kathmandu, and officials of the provisions of the draft Constitution states that the new Charter should be adopted until Sunday.
Certainly, right now we can't panic.
After the loss of the ice master Litvinova you couldn't even domestic duel with hockey players of Sparta (3: 5).
Aren't you concerned about similarly disastrous entry into the big leagues as a year ago?
I hope that nothing like this will not happen.

For moderately overweight diabetics could be useful in weight-loss surgery
The benefits of weight-loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to tell whether the mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes after weight-loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatment for them.
"mortality data take a long time to display," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight-loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study JAMA surgery.
For weight-loss surgery, bariatric surgery to reduce his stomach using different methods.
Reducing hunger and the limitations of the human body absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was carried out on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures weight relative to height, the relationship is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher suggests overweight person and people with a value of over 30 is considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
For their new study, the researchers used the min-sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from the study from 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and a gastrectomy - medical treatments in type 3 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery, according to the study, fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
In the meantime, those who remained BMI wasn't granted surgical treatment of diabetes, roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with diabetes were resolved completely operations in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the treated group was compared to medicine for diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and only partially for about 2 percent of patients.
There was also blood pressure control, trigylceridů and "bad" LDL cholesterol demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient hemoglobin a1c levels in the blood, which reflects the continuous blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, noted the researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c value dropped from about 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the group treated with medication, however, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this "better glycaemic control" - reflected in improved levels of hemoglobin A1c -- to reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. chih-cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared with the average results of two types of surgery.
After the fifth year with the bypass group lost more weight compared to a gastrectomy (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), reached a larger BMI against downturns (7.4 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent to 2.1 percent) and had a greater likelihood of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent to 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not improve survival or surgery after five years of studies, there is evidence of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona College of medicine-phoenix.
According to the Swedish study were obese people who underwent bariatric surgery, about 29 percent greater chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to the group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival between patients after surgery, according to Blackstone's soothing outcome for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"this work is critical, because it suggests that surgery is safer in a group with lower BMI," without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, States.
Blackstone also maintains that the people and their doctors should start taking seriously after patient weight decrease in BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long with people, we make it very clear that the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once the accumulation of these genetic changes in their bodies, which firmly links with obesity and diabetes, the way back is really difficult.
"it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe is not able to accommodate all of the refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama has addressed the question of the ongoing refugee crisis in his acceptance speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama centre for compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He claimed that, under current circumstances, the interest of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
Also pointed out that the answer from western European countries, whether it was in any way admirable, the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the effort of Germany and Austria in the resolution, pointed out that it's only a temporary solution.
"take care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you'll have to think about a long-term solution, a way to bring real peace and real development, in particular through the education of those Muslim countries," he pointed out.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force will never solve these problems, "he added.
In addressing issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also expressed the actions of George Bush after the 9 / 11 terrorist attack, and claim that "violent reaction caused us uncontrollable chain of events.
After 9 / 11, I express my condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem, not the violent path.
I know that his motives were good, but he used his strength to create unexpected consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.
A fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested sanitation reagent for the last 4 years
Poison control centres around the United States reported nearly 400-procentní increase since 2010 in the number of children up to 12 years, which swallowed the highly alcoholic reagent sanitation, according to the Poison Center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of ingestion of sanitation for children up to 12 years, which were reported to poison control centers increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"kids are getting these products more often and, unfortunately, there is a percentage of children that need to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitation means deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
The YouTube video shows teenage drinking means sanitation due to cheap fuss.
The teenagers reportedly sanitation means mixed with Mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be drawn to the attractive scent of appeal.
"kids don't think about it, that it might hurt them," said Lopez.
Plenty of more attractive (sanitation funds) are those which are parfémovány.
Sanitation resources available are scented with strawberries or grapefruit, oranges, which are very tempting for children.
Sanitation device contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children can mean a few sips of alcohol poisoning.
"this is a highly concentrated alcohol," he told Fox 4 in Kansas City, the medical director of the poison control center at the University of Kansas hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
They wouldn't let you drink whiskey just lying around, but these sanitation means people leave out, and when they were children, it's a quick trip to the consumption of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a 6-year-old girl, who recently took four gulps in school when sanitation agents with the scent of strawberries and was rushed to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was twice the .179, which is considered the threshold for drunk adult, according to Dr Chris ritcheyho, emergency doctor who cared for her in the Gwinnett medical center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah slurred words and she wasn't able to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital, for any signs of brain trauma, because a girl for alcohol fell and hit her head, Ritchey points out.
"it was very scary," said Scott, the mother of CNN ortoria nhaijah.
It could be fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or arrange for them to be out of the reach of children means sanitation.
Outside of alcohol poisoning were some sanitation resources associated with death.
In 2013, two women died from Ontario after swallowing sanitation appeal, which contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The medics believed that the product contains methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January three of fourth grade students in northern New York planned to poison their "bad" teachers the stationing of antibacterial products around the room, "according to the police report.
The teacher is extremely allergic to sanitation means and banned their presence in the room.
Police foiled the plan as "innocent chit-chat," and referred to the school district, discipline

Why was I witnessed the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I'll watch the killing of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't come to that, I'll sit in the viewing gallery at the Oklahoma State Prison death chamber and see Richard glossipa, who will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me if I was one of the four officials, who witnessed his death.
As soon as I received the invitation in January through his best friend and even though I was so shocked, I agreed.
As the days get closer, I'm starting to get worried.
Why do it then?
I accepted the invitation, because I think it's a good way to me, how am I going to be able to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would have offered me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because it is often more applications than positions, morbid lottery that will decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, will monitor the entire execution dispassionately.
I can't do it.
I'll be sitting alongside Richard glossipa's closest friends, and I've developed a special connection to him through the phone calls one month and two and a half hour visit.
I like this guy.
Often when we laugh, we talk.
Prison service says he cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, I'm compromising his impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he would like that, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "it could formulate better," but still thinks that what I do is wrong.
Richard glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if it did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him that I may at any time remove from the witness list.
But he wants an international journalist who will be on site ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help practices against the death penalty.
Kim bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
If you want to know more information about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I created.
Here again, I will not repeat all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van treese would make him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that the murder is innocent.
I absolutely believe that it had not provided sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion it's bad execution.
And from this perspective, I'll just follow his death.
I can't say I'll be truly objective.
For this purpose, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience what it's like to see a man I like, to die a meaningless death.
The man escaped from the canning river after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after a man pulled from the canning River.
Bet the man from escaping petrhu, didn't come to the police after he got into the shallow, muddy water just feet from the officers, who tried to persuade him gently back to shore.
Police from Canning Vale was summoned over the incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them across the river unikem Canning.
But he didn't get far.
"he was standing in the water and said" I'm not going out just to take me, "said Sergeant shandell castledine.
Constable Lachlan perhavec just didn't want to get wet uniform, then tried to use safer and police tactics that negotiation. "
"sometimes people do funny things when trying to escape," said castledine.

Peter Moody says organisers tried to spy on him and risk the closure of plants
Peter Moody accused racing Victoria stewards that he tried to get a spy into the stables last year and threatened to stop racing.
He focused on the organiser and racing Victoria integrity department and based on the belief that they have a personal campaign against him with a late scratch lady tatai during maintenance on race day, which for him Wednesday was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in a difficult situation as regards lidarin positive swab to cobalt, which he can't explain.
He bit his tongue on charges of espionage for 18 months and didn't want it to look like a "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about the fact that I'm sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it comes from you all at once," said Moody.
They know that it went on.
Sometimes you have to live with the consequences and react, and I'll have to live with what I said.
Today, I go home and get a good night's sleep.
I want to go out with his head up and to the owners thought they were doing the best for them.
If they think otherwise, then I shouldn't be the coach.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm gonna do my licences.
Previously released Moody in his interview for the racing.com bomb that the integrity department tried to spy on him.
"eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man whom I named after question - and offered him a job in my stables for information to find out about things that are in my stables," Moody said on racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's so, they should show all of your information, because you have utterly failed in an attempt to catch me.
Robert roulston, former RVL Chairman David Moodie, the current president of RVL, and Bernard saundry, the current CEO of RVL, that at the time were aware, and are aware of it even today.
I should think that it becomes a personal matter?
RVL lets grow some balls and arrange to people outside the coaching position they took responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
I'm all for this industry is bad?
I'm just really, really bad for the industry?
Maybe the people here think that it does.
Maybe I need to take my licence and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them stuff to think about.
But I've gotten to the point, if that doesn't matter to me anymore, and I'm really sad.
I'm really sad.
I'll push them and carry the burden on them, to make the decision.
I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.
Coach's frustration levels increased with long-term investigation for cobalt including lidari and recent scratches made him feel he could "hours my license on the table."
Mood, most famous for the preparation of the undefeated champion black caviar, the rule called for treatment on race day, "ridiculous" after he was injected on the horse a poultice of mud or clay, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
One of my team accidentally smeared mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday and it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treatment the tiling in the day of the race, which the organisers have already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who create these rules, doesn't know anything about horses.
"we all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.

Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back for wrestling claim rivals
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy, surgeries, criticized his players as "agenda setting" two NRL premiership favourites.
Sydney roosters coach, Trent Robinson, said that the referee allowed players wrestlovat "storm" his controversial victory team player during the storm in the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slightly veiled comment, the Strorm after his team won the finals qualification over the North Queensland cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game a "parade" rugby league and according to him, two Queensland weren't "too big" to Wrestlemania.
Bellamy surgeries defended his players and said that the focus on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation has increased his confidence, his team has been criticised because it's two leading trainers, which may mean that they have the fear of losing team since the storm.
"it still is - I don't remember that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling, 24-2, when they beat us," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that in the last year, we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and techniques, the last few weeks we only emphasized during crackdown on contact, and it meant turnover for us.
Trent's here for three years and obviously a great coaching team, so it's probably not used to losing, which for him might be a bit of a shock.
It's funny how these things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy, Bennett's idea of exciting football "devalued" and reminded his mentor, St george-illawarra dragons bennetovův team that won the premiership in 2010, playing "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about the exciting football.
He was right about his game on Saturday was similarly exciting like ours also was as exciting, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George were criticized for the fact that they were boring team and Wayne said that that didn't matter to him.
But now he has a team that can play that style of play, he feels the cancellation, particularly his young quarterbacks with their speed.
So you want to play football, if you have access to this type of players.
This opinion in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play his style of football teams - but not every team has two reservists like Anthony Milford and Ben hunt, so that's the style they play.
It makes me more confident, because they say those things, because they are worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, the US probably haven't even thought of, when getting to the big matches.
Bellamy also pointed out that in the storm and roosters game more wickets fell before the game, the Broncos and the cowboys.
Broncos likely team game was good, I haven't checked, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game over 20-18 in our game, there were two more attempts, but it's exciting football?
Or are the breaks and neskórování attempts that interesting?
I think it's agenda.
If you refer to the US, that means that at some stage we shall meet again.
Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland or cronulla cownboys sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park, tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.

Arsenal Captain Mikel arteta says teammates must get behind the injured Jack wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
For wilshere, Wenger also stressed that it's still only September, and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason for him to play again at Christmas.
This best scenario means that wilshere would miss at least the next four games and, from the point of view of English history, his involvement in next summer's European Championships, is obviously uncertain.
A great pity this nnejnovějšího problem is that wilshere finished strong after ankle injury last season and then again reached the former during předsezóny forms.
"this kind of injury does not jeopardise his career," says Wenger.
It's a wound that needs healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't even his ankle injuries, suffered before.
That might be true, from a purely medical point of view because Wenger has admitted that there is a risk of further injury, whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant formula.
Survey conducted by Premier injuries Ltd recorded 23 different injuries wilshera since six years ago, he had his debut game.
During the last five years, he played in only 65 league matches, arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective, this means that for Arsenal in six of eight seasons from 2007-08 was one of two clubs in the Premier League, who lost the most days because of the injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that improvements in recorded injuries during last season will continue.
"sometimes, when you're coming back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the competition," says Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body is stabilizing, I'm sure he does, and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal's Champions League campaign at Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night against the games on Saturday, with Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger prepares to rotate his team.
Héctor bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, it means that Mathieu debuchy and arteta will probably.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Nacho monreala Olivier giroudem instead of Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and let the players who need it, breathe out," says Wenger.
Even if Arsenal is clear favourite to progress from Group F maksimir, Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating Stadium in Europe.
Dinamo also haven't been defeated in a total of 41 games last season, after their campaign "invincible".
The stadium on Wednesday night, the earthquake shook the 3.2 degrees of Richter.
It was this year for the tenth time in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League, when capitulated against Monaco and he remains a remote hope will lead the club to their first victory in the European Cup.
"this deployment is enormous," says Wenger.
Arsenal: it never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
Friendsfest: comedy show, which gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The lack of a similar view in different show is striking, particularly given how men need to open up more desperate than ever, as far as suicides among young men in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the biggest single cause of death for men aged 20-45 years in Great Britain and is three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address this problem, the campaign against living miserably (calm) year Year 2015 as a man whose aim is to challenge the culture that prevents men seek help in case of need.
Friendship is at the heart of this struggle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students reporting symptoms of depression found that, in the event that he had damaged a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "a healthy attitude," their chances of recovery has doubled.
As for those who are depressed, mentally healthy friends circle represents half a chance on the incidence of mental health problems.
But friendship, in order to work, must of course be achievable as soon as possible.
In this communication via social media, with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the Communication, the immediate response is often preferable to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives has doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even if we're in reality rather isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, social status, image, all at the expense of our real values, our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And not so long ago, he explained how one billionaire and game designer, money really can't buy more happiness.
The beauty of the show friends was for him a source of this idea.
One of the characters was not defined by their work, but their personalities shone through friendly interactions.
Joey and Chandler's frequent victims of humor, moments of watching football on comfy chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that, yes, men can also identify with it, although usually they keep your feelings to yourself.
Kindly explain to me how one worker:... "my role as an audience of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions may make a difference."
The men who contact us, often feel an inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends are one of the shows, which arise in my memory when I'm trying to offer longer-term compensation mechanism.
Highlights the small moments in a man's friendship.
As for my task, outsider status on the phone, to help people in moments of despair, but long-term aid must come from a bigger network of close friends and family.
So if you're planning on frendsfest this weekend hosted by comedy central station, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior to the celebration will be completely overhauled.
Or when you see someone alone in a Starbucks, just smile and say hello to him.
You never know what difference it can make your friendship.
"friends" will be broadcast on comedy central station from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for friendsfest #
Di Maria scored and helped sweep aside PSG Malmo
Angel di Maria celebrates with Charlotte and matuidim edinsonem cavanim run after goal against malmu.
Angel di Maria scored in his debut in the Champions League and so helped PSG on Tuesday beat Swedish team Malmo.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and started their journey in Paris Saint-Germain Champions League final victory against malmu comfortable 2-0 at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after their debut in the Champions League and the player sent the French Champions PSG to victory, but then threw away several chances, until finally upped their lead when Cavani scored his goal in the 61st minute.
Shakhtar Donetsk and Real Madrid are also in the group and the team, and that's why Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, are not just focusing on the skills to the elimination rounds, but to improve their road to the quarter-finals, which recorded in each of the previous three years.
But even if you get three points, it wasn't a classic performance team of Laurent Blanc and ibrahimovic Gilden was wasteful in front of the net and was later replaced by against his home team and club in which he began his illustrious career in 1999.
"it's not easy to win the Champions League or win 2-0 at home, so does our opponents problems and look comfortable in defence is a good start, even if there are things that we need to improve the procedure with the season," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we nevstřelili about one or two more wickets.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of three changes to the team, PSG, who took home this weekend draw 2-2 with Bordeaux in League 1, but he was upstaged by di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was identified as the man who moves to a new level of PSG in Europe after transferring from Manchester United, which took place last month, and he showed why, when he ran on the pass for defense Marc verrattiho Malm and beautiful finish behind Johan wilanda sent the ball into the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone starts it, expecting a big victory, PSG must have been disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in the playoffs and got to this stage, replaced in the starting lineup with nine International and five defenders and two reservists were retracted a formidable opponent.
But in addition to the missiles, Nikola djurdjice narrowly missed the far corner of the goal in the 34th minute Kevin Trapp, it didn't offer much in attack.
Instead, PSG were themselves benefit from the attack on the poor and miserable přihrávkami endings, which wasn't good even from ibrahimovice, who couldn't even shot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed, because his shot into the net arrived shortly after the start of the second half Cavani.
However, pointed much more appropriate, when it came to the preparation of the chances for his teammates, and it was from his pass, when di Maria sent missile drill, which ended in wilandově goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of the game, thanks to the Uruguayan cavanimu sent this head line for the sixth goal this season after his ibrahimovic scored from the left wing after a pass from Maxwell.
That ended any thoughts Malm regarding the possibility that they could extract something from the game, and only an excellent save from very near wilanda dashed the hopes of David Luiz and the score remained unchanged even when the goal was střídajícího Ezequiel lavezziho unrecognized at the end of the game.
Malmö coach Åge hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, nor stated: "our last game in the Champions League took place in December of last year."
Since then, we just played Swedish League, which is not on the same level.
The qualifying matches is not enough.
Hats off for Paris.
For them it was a fascinating game.

As the refugee crisis ripped through the Schengen area.
An emergency beacon was launched by far Germany nestmelila European crew, but he forced the ship to change course, he wrote the French newspaper Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the problem of refugees will be systematically sort: more migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they step up to the old continent - in particular Greece, than to argue for the sake of future distribution of refugees According to quotas on the basis of quantity, which increasingly away from reality.
Six days after the European Commission President Jean-Claude JUNCKER asked 25 of the 28 EU countries, and reallocated to 160,000 refugees, they changed the interior ministers of the Member States ’ priority.
Than worry about the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who are arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already inside the Schengen area.
"the effective management of the external borders of the EU is necessary for managing migration," stressed in text Ministers discussed Monday in Brussels.
After the crisis, the EU is a common currency that is at risk in his next big integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but loses his decisiveness and increases the pressure.
Restoring border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those who seek asylum in this country.
Central power that makes it clear that, without it, there is no free movement in Europe possible.
It would serve as proof that Austria and Slovakia on Monday to join this action.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and even France are thinking about it, too, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary to the already long ago.
This exceptional and temporary measures are allowed under Schengen rules.
That's a domino effect, but even a blind man can see.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, Southern Italy and also in Hungary, for those who have already passed into the interior.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague, Thomas de Maizière intensively discussed about it during a private conversation with three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is tough.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics were already registered and identified with taking fingerprints two-thirds of newly arrived refugees.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory, because they fear more than the others, so on her shoulders, left the camps in which the refugees massed on its behalf.
True, Greece remains a black hole.
On its islands near the Turkish coast landed this year, more than 200,000 people, which is more than twice recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through the crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge, gaping hole.
Athens, which are still in financial turmoil and they are waiting for a new government, his hands folded in his lap.
That's the starting point for the Balkan route and now common source of worry for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
JUNCKER the Commission promises to introduce control points there as soon as possible, but did not provide any number or a date.
"the challenges faced by Greece, relate to the whole of Europe," agreed on Monday, European Union Interior Ministers on the mobilization on this front.
It is therefore in this country to deploy teams of the European Border Control Agency Frontex.
The EU wants to help Greece to extend its capacity for receiving refugees and to strengthen oversight of the islands.
"it will require adequate financial resources," warns the text submitted to Ministers for approval.
From the point of view of the law will continue to have the last word in Athens.
The real question of the creation of European border guards had not been officially filed, but Europe a close second.
The new emergency situation 'as she pushed on the back burner so the question of mandatory quotas and 160 thousand refugees already at the beginning of the year, which raised the Juncker for the Commission and the European Parliament, and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
It is considered an attack on its sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, Monday was maintained in the text approved mostly '.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only solid promise includes the redistribution of 40 thousand refugees in the next two years, on which agreement has been reached in the June EU summit concluded during the hectic, Le Figaro.
