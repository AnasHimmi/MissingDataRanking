When an emergency call the professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend
During the calls to the emergency line to his voice Professor Shannon lamb admitted to police that he shot his girlfriend and it is necessary to come to their home.
Lamb himself, that his "Sweet Dog" house was alive and probably upset, and that contacts the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on the White Paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," said the letter signed by Lamb, who, according to authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles on a school campus, where police believe he shot favorite professor Ethan Schmidt in the door of his office.
The police chief in the Delta State University Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
Lamb said the fateful phone call to an emergency line shortly after.
Finally came another death; lamb took his own life when police came for him.
The day after the school shooting, students and the faculty, forced to hide behind locked doors, the responsible authority is still trying to figure out what was the lamb's motivation.
The details, which the investigators published on the part of the State and the students and staff who knew him, and together they created the image of a talented, but probably a troubled teacher.
Students have confirmed that his lessons forward.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt himself included lamb in the book, which he wrote, in a thank-you "great people" with whom he shared academic life.

Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that it was confronted with stress at the end of the academic year HWC 2014-15.
Lamb has previously applied for Delta state university for some time off for health reasons, when it stated that he has a problem.
And this year only taught two online courses.
The recent changes regarding the recruitment of University meant that a Phd on which lamb worked hard, he would be guaranteed automatic term to become assistant professor.
University President William LaForge stated that he didn't know about any conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. lamb obviously worried about something."
To answer these questions we have lamb.
After he left the campus, the police caught his foot when he crossed the border of the State of Arkansas back into misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, lamb jedinýmvýstřelem killed from a gun in the yard of the house about a mile from his parents on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington State confirmed the coroner, methel Johnson.

Lamb in this country grew up.
Lamb started work at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of training.
In the spring, he got a doctorate in education.
One of the long-time friends lamb described him as a bright, charismatic and funny man.
Carl Hairston stated that she was 15 and lamb, 20, when they met through mutual friends.
She was with friends in high school and he was a great older guy who tutored her for a few years playing guitar.
It was a heartbreaker.
Heart of the girls softened as soon as he appeared, "said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in a suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss allegedly together some time.
During the emergency call, Lamb said: "I killed my wife," but the record of marriage never existed.
Had a dog named lightning, who lived with them in a brick house, which adjoins the river shoulder Gautier.
The police said that the dog was fine.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O ’ Steen, said that broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"she was completely collapsed," said O Steen about his daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
O ’ Steen said he met with lamb, but through his daughter Abigail to know that lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met with prentiss, When together with Abigail vystuopovali at Summer Festival three years ago.
Later played together random gigy.
O ’ Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse, who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender, and occasional entertainment coordinator in the julep room, a dimly lighted bar near Gautier, said he last saw lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, sweat, what lamb played guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"it was just a happy couple," he said.
Oprah and recording each other on a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, killed a professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, professor of English at school.
He was married and had three small children.

This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Feet for the Associated Press, Emily wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this story.
This story has been amended to reflect the fact that the police now claim that lamb did call the emergency line after killing Schmidt, and although Lamb called Prentiss, his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.

8 electoral numbers, which show that Donald Trump in real light
Some tried to label him as a person, which often change their minds.
Others waved above as a joke.
And some are preparing for the implosion.
But some Republicans Donald Trump trying to pull down from the top of the elections, they're not (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead for a two-digit number, and some people are beginning to seriously ask what it means for nomination chances of this real estate tycoon.
Of course, it is still only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of the year 2011 Rick Perry's leadership made its way to the rise of Herman Cain, in the end, neither of them won the only position in the nominating process.
There are many reasons why you might encounter in the general election.
But outside groups like super PACs Jeb Bush and economic conservative group club for growth are aware trumpovu will endure and began unloading their dollars on the table in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent poll numbers, which suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
The evaluation trumpovo turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, monmouth university poll showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnate.
In mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
He now has six of the 10 Republicans to take a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are in the early stages.
After the vote, quinnipiac University, which took place last week, found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Donald Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN / ORC poll, which was conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans indicated that they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" with Donald Trump as a candidate.
Only two of the 10 reported that they were "outraged" of his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as trump (43 percent of people said that they would be "delighted" against 40 percent who say the same of Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if the front-runner Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans see Trump as a temper problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticised for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide is receptive to the idea that the real estate magnate has the right temperament for the presidency, according to the Monday vote ABC News / Washington Post.
The same number are holding senatorial club in the State of Iowa, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality of a leader, according to quinnipiac from last week.
Yet 44 percent think he has the personality to serve effectively, and almost six out of 10 independent says his temperament does not belong to the White House, according to ABC / post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When he puts on his učenecké hats, Republican voters think Trump is the real candidate.
On the question of who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was the best choice, according to the CNN / ORC poll from last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: the GOP voters had in the past, the brightest crystal ball.
At this time last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans selected as the winner of a Rick Perry candidacy against 28 percent for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.
Yet, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump as a credible campaign.
Even if Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everybody.
Some scholars point out that a fragmented field is likely to contribute to trump's leadership, while possessing anti-trumpovská aid is distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But monmouth university poll from early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always majority support.
Carly fiorinou leads by 13 points, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, John kasichem 33 points in each.
He's in a race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead over businessman about broad 19 points in a hypothetical match one against one.
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters argue that he has already made his opinion.
A new CBS / nyt survey on Tuesday shows that just more than half of the voters supporting trump maintains that she will not change her mind.
It is obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that he never changed his mind.
46 percent of States that keep options open for change among the candidates.
Yet Trump's current strongest opponent his outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who regard their minds in the final, if they were twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans allegedly agrees with Trump on immigration issues.
Even from the moment when Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech, immigration still holds as the main and the central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that the bombast of Trump to lure key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and the damage of a re-branding effort.
But according to Monday's new ABC / Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans claim that agrees with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will also stay.
Frustration with the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are today roughly half the support from Republican voters, especially given their underdog status.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new Monday night vote ABC / Post claims that they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry at Washington.
Vote Des Moines Register / Bloomberg Iowa several weeks revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated Republicans in Congress, 54 percent is "unhappy" and 21 percent "angry as hell."
The House of Representatives supported a greater share of State charges for coal.
The Czech Republic receives more than 400 million.
The Chamber of Deputies in a first reading The government supported Amendments to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of revenue from fees open-cast mining brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (čssd) promised members that, because they get extra money as the Treasury, municipal budgets.
The draft was criticized by members of the opposition, who fear that the mining companies won't want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they pay higher fees directly to the state government supported rozpočtu.sněmovna at first reading amendments to the Mining Act, which among other things means that the State should receive a greater proportion of revenue from fees from open-cast mining brown coal from mining companies.
The State ’ s share will increase to 67 percent, while the share municipalities will be reduced from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also change the method of calculating reimbursement for minerals that the firm mined.
The change in charges for the extraction of minerals is to bring to the Treasury about 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
On revenue budgets of municipalities have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee is to be higher.
In the year of the fee received from roughly 450 million kroner and the State budget of 150 million kroner.
From brown coal mining was municipalities about 200 million crowns and State 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in remuneration of extraction space with allowed mining at 1,000 kroner per hectare per year.
Income from these payments still has in its entirety belong to municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (čssd) members said that the municipalities that gain a year instead of 14 million to 100 million kroner.
The amount of mining fees won't determine the law, but it provides government regulation.
The payment will be calculated by multiplying the amount of newly harvested the mineral and rates for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, is the reason for the amendment, among other things, the possibility of flexible reactions to the current economic situation.
MP ODS Marek Benda but warned that setting the fee by government may not be in line with the Constitution.
According to the Minister, but the doctor isn't in this case because the State tax levied on mineral, which is state property.
The fees, receive only municipalities, whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep-sea mining coal will get three quarters of the money municipalities and a quarter of the State.
The same ratio will also be the case for the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money, which the State mining royalties from selects will be ring-fenced.
For example, 28 percent will have to go on damage control, after logging, mining or to ensure the emergency services.
The draft criticized opposition MPs who claimed, in particular, that damaged municipalities affected by mining region.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and mayors), warned that mining companies no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they pay higher fees directly into the State budget.
"it is not possible to tunnel in one of the poorest regions, because the Minister of Finance to improve budget," said David Kádner (dawn) elected in ústí.
Before the surge in unemployment pro MP warned KSČM Han aulická.
Kádner and aulická unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to reject, Kučera wanted to return government to the completion of the law.
In the explanatory memorandum is that, according to mining firms to increase fees reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent of long-term contracted.
The main consumers such as power plants or CHP should therefore not feel price growth.
"on the other hand, however, this really increases the risk that mining organisations will increase reimbursements to compensate for efforts to reduce its operating expenses, which primarily means reducing the number of employees," admits the government.
It is, however, an increase in fees from the point of view of employment.
According to the rapporteur, to the novel Milana Urbana (čssd) is key to members before the approval of the law knew the conclusions on the updated Energy Concept, and especially the government's decision about the limits on coal mining.
If coal will also benefit the limits, then it will have implications for the proceeds for the State and municipalities, he pointed out.
Urban disagrees with Mládek, in that the decision of the breaking down of the Czechoslovak army should fall until after 2020.
Limits on the CSA down, he says, should break it for social reasons, and because of the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Jolly will lead the Czechs as number one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players appear in the Davis Cup draw Thursday baráže in India on the board and this time each of them probably even hits in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil is planning that, given the difficult conditions spread the load across the quartet.
In Delhi, there is heat and high humidity, therefore expect challenging matches, which can stretch to five sets.
We need to take that into account.
I'd like it spread by the weather.
And, depending on how it will look back at today's training, said Czech selection in downtown gladyou kumára khánny.
With one team and the world forty George cheerful counts in both Friday and Sunday's singles.
The position probably 2 roll back Luke jelly and Radek štěpánek.
I'd like to engage in almost everyone.
Slowly, I got it in my head, but I won't say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech lineup should be štěpánkova participation in Saturday's doubles.
Only question is, who will stand next to an experienced deblisty, who is in doubles in the Davis Cup record 18: 4.
It probably won't be happy.
Options with jelly, or Adam pavláskem.
"I really don't know who and how it will look," he said.
Decides to singles under development.
Option may be Pavlásek, with a surprise in the first round in doubles, winning over Australians.

Against Australia, I did it right, if I play, I'd like to show the same performance, I've been there since the second set.
"I'm glad for the experience and I would like to bring," said Pavlásek.
Domestic singles to Yuki bhambriho (125th in the ATP rankings) who won a challenger last week in Shanghai, where he beat players ranked third and fourth hundreds.
Two will be somdev devvarman (164).
They are both players of challengerů and our experience of the ATP Tour, but a lot of times we've convinced in the Davis Cup rankings to decide.
"the present form, the weather," he said.
Friday's opening singles start at 6: 30 CEST and can stretch out because of the weather.
Rain is forecast and Kurt is not under the roof.

Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour leader standing in silence during the singing of the national anthem in the service on Tuesday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was met with criticism from a number of conservative members and is the centre of attention a couple of stories on the front page of the newspapers.
The decision of Mr corbyna no singing the national anthem has attracted attention on yourself
A spokesman for Mr. corbyna said he would be "stood in respectful silence" and recognise "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of the Shadow Cabinet, Mr corbyna, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that labouristickému leaders recommended to sing the national anthem, "notwithstanding" his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in a top team Mr. corbyna, citing differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth parliamentary parties initially supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work also "add" following the appointment of Mr corbyna over his position in the European Union and the government limit benefits.

Mr Corbyn is the fifth leader of the labor party, he faced David Cameron in the last decade since his election as Conservative leader.
The leader of the labor party, who promised a different approach to politics, argues that he has ideas "from the crowd," the questions for Mr Cameron and received more than 30 000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that pmq are too confrontational and refrain from how "ready answers," sprocket, trade and instead promises that will focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn argues that Angela Eagle, the shadow Business Secretary, will represent him at pmq, when it will not participate — like, for example, when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
Also dropped from the thoughts that would let other colleagues to him from time to time, because that, still discuss the matter with the Speaker of the house John bercowem.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said that he wants to divert from the Punch and Judy style of politics "," which was often associated with pmq, but a few years later, he admitted that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990 pmq were seen as a key barometer of opinion leaders, their leadership of the house and their position among the other MP, although critics argued that became a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.

Metcash's campaign in the country, to fight invasion Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IgA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Metcash's campaign in the country, to fight invasion Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers, and the first of the more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, metcash and IgA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build brand IgA using marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IgA retailers and suppliers to add brands like dunsborough based on the ice cream maker Simmo's tastings in Iga stores and the store owners are selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League, local customers.
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defence strategy of 29 September, when sales of food, alcohol, hardware and celebrates its annual strategic investor day.
There is a lot at stake here, because southern and western Australia account for almost 30 percent of metcash IgA commercial steps and generate higher turnover than metcash IgA network in the eastern states.
Customers in the south and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IgA stores are enjoying a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - in SA, more than 30 percent and 24 percent in wa compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
Anyway, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believes that Aldi have the snares 5 per cent of the food market in these two States during the 12 months since the opening of the first shops that have taken sales from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
In its report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom kierath, estimated that retail IgA could lose $360 million in annual sales and metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West during the next year, it will generate sales of 500 and 600 million USD in different markets.
Waste of food sales and volumes in fixed price basis metcash would have cost around $13 million on pre-tax income, said Mr kierath.
At the same time, metcash loses share of markets in the eastern states, especially to Aldi and Coles, although recent Roy Morgan survey found that shoppers in Iga were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks metcash food sales fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and its market share reduced from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by the year 2020.
Last week a leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could be "highly likely to disappear within decades.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to the Douglass comment.
But it is known that a member of the Board of Directors of metcash contacted Douglass last week.
IgA's market share dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and earnings from the food trade, metcash, which supplies IgA, about 1,200 retailers fell by 43 percent from 2012, reflecting operational development changes speculation, because sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesale counterattacked and invest more than $150 million a year to supplement the regular price in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and helping IgA retailers to recapture the business by adding the rapidly growing food and news from investors.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice, argues that programmes increasingly prices and retrofitting shops caught momentum and hopes that velkoprodej returns back to the basic profitable growth profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves for his behavior glory rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became collateral damage during the recent fuss around his friend Nick kyrgiose and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, the President of tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a junior member of the talented duo often called "Special KS," Drew unwelcome attention thanks to her affair with the infamous kyrgiosem and wawrinkou tent at the Montreal masters.
Soon after, in passionate qualification match in Cincinnati, had to be his opponent Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison two separate arbitration, Harrison said afterwards: "wawrinka had one stretch kyrgiosovi and I should reach out to him, too."
While he was last seen smashing a racket after he thwarted a possible defeat Richard gasqueta at the US Open, staunchly defended kokkinakise Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where they compete with Sam Groth on the location in the second singles behind Bernard romicem in the Davis Cup semifinals against Britain.
"pretty intense, I was thinking about that in my opinion the thanasi was a bit drawn," says Healy.
Destroyed his racket when he lost because of spasms in the US, but it's not the first player you would because of the frustration of himself took his anger out on his rocket thanasiho know well enough, and I can tell that this event will not be proud of.
But I really was very good, because he was in the US exposed to very provocative circumstances about Harrison and so on, so, in my opinion, deserves great credit.
He has a great team around him, he also has a great family around me, and I think that his treatment was a little hard.
It's a very grown-up 19-year-old man, he works very hard, and the team is great and so on, never had a problem with other players in the dressing room is very respected, he trains hard, he's in great shape, it's a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged according to their own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook kyrgiose for an important match, which starts on Friday, and states that the "mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports a native of Canberra to return to the team as a long-term star.
"first of all we want our team completely focused on the game and not at all the controversy around him [kyrgios] was formed," says Healy.
And I think Nick rose very quickly how Federer, Murray and other people point, in the eyes of the public is growing rapidly, have also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight, when he would think about that, in my opinion, is the best solution for the team and for himself.
The European Migration Crisis: Hungary Declares State of emergency, closes borders and holding migrants
After the notification of the emergency Tuesday Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia and held off those who tried to have her illegal crossing to stop the tide of migrants.
On the border chaos, while hundreds of migrants piling up in no man's land and the Serbian authorities have responded indignantly.
Those who stuck to an unknown time on the strip of land between two States are those who are fleeing the violence in their native countries, tents and settling in.
But the feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter overhead, migrants together are calling "open the borders!" and cursing a Hungarian police riot unit.
Some of the protest are refusing food and water.
Serbian foreign minister declares that it was "unacceptable" to the refugees were sent back from Hungary, while there are still more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, and not just the indirect harm.
During the next days will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries, "says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest maďarsko-srbské border came a day after the block 28 states to come up with a coherent immigration policy on the ongoing meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to sharing responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in a surprised Italy and Greece and talked with the hope of achieving the eventual agreement next month or at the end of the year, which EU nations have accepted more than 120 000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, their hope Junior ROTC at Brussels or his neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the road and speed up court cases discussing asylum.
In the meantime, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania, to stop refugees who seek to transition through their country, if it's now completed a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News korepondent Charlie d'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped put barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary became the main weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom fled from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted, however, that most of them are economic migrants who are coming for a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, which is a look that clearly differ from other EU States, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalising violation of 4 a three-foot fence, which the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for a longer period in jail for those refugees illegally transferred.
"because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we have the clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, the Parliament must still approve the deployment of the army, which is expected in the next week, but associated press reporters on the border watching a heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy bakondi, adviser to Orban for home defense, said that authorities captured 45 people who tried to cross the border and captured 15 already on the territory of the State.
With the damage to the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing offences under the new laws.
Authorities quickly left to fix the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after they used a tractor truck covered with barbed wire.
At the main border crossing at roszke created chaos, because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and crowds of people.
About 20 of them to fit in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, when they refused food and water until they're allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton ahead of Bernie Sanders was halved in the national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders gaining on her lead.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to be president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months prior to major competitions, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are clearly the decision about which candidate they will support.
But Clinton ’ s sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
From a CBS News poll from last month, Clinton lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and mitigates, but her lead is narrowing.
Her support among men has reduced dramatically, and Sanders at her loses only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under 50 years evaporated and now are equal to Sanders.
Clinton still has a big lead thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in double digits ahead of Sanders among liberals, but now her Sanders loses in this group only 5 points.
About half of Democratic primary voters in the United States say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support it only for that, that's a candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
I guess it's no surprise that are current přivrženci Clinton because of her particular passion.
Views are mixed between those that currently do not support Clinton -- only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same thing about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When are the Clinton supporters asked in an open question, why do they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that he has the right experience (16 percent), followed by, that is, it's time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Supporters of Clinton also mentioned her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It also cited a big choice election and consensus on the issues.
While the Vice President is considering a potential candidacy for President, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would wish to face - a third thinks that she would not run.
When Democratic primary voters were asked whom they would have chosen as the second choice for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters claimed more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton will spread out of 20 points, when Biden will run, 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning in the general election; but this number dropped from 78 percent from last month.
Biden is on a scale far in the second, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely zvolitelného increases.
However, when it came to the question of greater importance, the Democratic candidate, voters prefer solutions to problems before a greater chance of being elected.
As of last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, have good results in certain key characteristics among primary voters of his party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and he thinks they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden from all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same of Sanders (15 percent), but the 27 per cent it doesn't have this view.
Democratic primary voters also generally sees that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
For all those standards, about a quarter of democratic voters to Sanders has no opinion.
How questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email account and server as Secretary of State continues, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of this matter, and they say that their overall view of the affect her at all.
But among the American public, it's a whole different story.
Half of Americans is now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on this topic were divided in March, shortly after this problem came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, compared with 36 percent of their thoughts on Clinton.
It's all about the Republicans, where more than 6 in 10 say their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Despite the fact that Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy among voters her party, this question is still a problem among registered voters overall: just 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, which is down eight points from last month, and about 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters think is honest and trustworthy.
And at the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested in honesty best led Biden, Carson and bush.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters think of him didn't mind.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson over Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest survey, CBS News / New York Times
The two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest survey and others for their support.
Voters from the ranks of Republicans across the country continue to support Trump with an overwhelming majority, and climbed from 23% support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the debate fox news last month, 27% on Tuesday.

Five members of the fraternity accused of death of a first-year student Baruch College
Almost two years after a student died during přetěžovacího fraternal ritual in the pocono mountains in Pennsylvania, was filed murder charges against five men.
Members of the brotherhood of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during initiation ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
The police stated that he was blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand, a total weight of 30 pounds and he was repeatedly harassed, when trying to get to the target across frozen fields.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of headaches and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity called 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and allegedly waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, the police said.
However, they have found the time to change clothes, Deng Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the National President of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, said police chief Chris - at the press conference.
"in this moment they hide members gear and basically preferring welfare brotherhood before life Michael Deng," stated chief Wagner.
Unable to revive him and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck by blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"too many families were zdevastováno due to overloading in bratrstvích and at least one student die every year because of hazing since 1970," writes Douglas fierberg, an attorney representing dengue family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and their members must responsibility and this step by the authorities is important.
Monroe County grand jury recommended charges of murder in the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault and criminal coming back.
"we want to hold not only the person concerned, but in the event that there is an organisation, which approved it, whether officially or unofficially, shunting responsibility also," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and national fraternity revoked its relationship with local branches.
This, with tents, when the Fed raises interest rates
Growth rates comes and bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy slides into recession.
All this we know.
What we don't know is how much time it would take and how long it will take.
For the economy, in particular, offers a little history on the timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, though not always, decisive in how the economy and financial assets to respond.
This is the reason why the American central bank officials stressed strongly so that investors would not be focused on when it begins raising rates, but rather the trajectory, how long will it take to standardisation.
The game is actually more variables.
In the end, however, may be members of the market to make sure that all the fuss about speed increase may be exaggerated.
"the Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as' the end of an era of cheap money, '" he said in a note for clients Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
By contrast, we don't anticipate that a gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low, creates a seismic shock, which many fear might be.
It means that there will be adverse effects.
Here's a look at how they react to certain areas of the economy, on the basis of historical trends:
Given what the market recorded last approximately a month, may be expected to raise rates to make the air a little bit unstable.
But as soon as there is increasing, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"it appears that there is a trend for stopping shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect LAGs in monetary policy," argued Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study about what happens after the Fed ’ s increase.
More specifically, the market for the last 35 years most often - about 14 percent - aiming to increase rates in relatively flat in 250 days (the average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with the average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis of Bob dolla, chief equity strategist of Nuveen asset management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the stock tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rate increases and the return of beginning to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but increase rates often help her.
Currently, the Fed is facing certain conditions that still exist, and which could hasten a recession.
The most remarkable is that the gross domestic product, close to its lowest point in the history of the Fed ’ s interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank was during 118 raising rates only twice since 1950, the year-on-year increase in nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few expect his keeping when, in the third quarter was only 1.5 percent, the Atlanta fed.
Raising rates in this difficult economic background could be risky and could occur, "the question of whether this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market participants were ready for the Fed ’ s growth all year and all eyes turned to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which was held this week and ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that at this meeting, the FOMC could approve the increase, future trading indicates only 25procentní probability.
"in our study since 1950 were all zvyšovací cycles so far in the great cycle of increasing leverage with the GDP peaks recession very quickly after the beginning of the recovery," it says in the report.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of these, when the Fed waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we're on 74 months and still continue.
Fixed income was also volatile, because the market is expected to increase rates and the model is somewhat similar to what they're experiencing shares.
The main difference is that the impact is more obvious in bonds than shares, when the Fed will change the direction of policy.
For bonds, it appears that the proceeds are changing direction immediately after the arrival of the first cycle of increase / decrease.
At the end of a cycle of increasing bond yields fall immediately, "said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that the increase in rates will cause approach yields between long- and krátce-datovanými bonds, which matched the curve.
High-yield bonds often in this climate, they work better, though, "we're still cautious about tightening yield," stated in its analysis, Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab.
What's interesting is that Jones thinks that the markets are no longer adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market adapt to tighter monetary policy prospects," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, firms which carry out most of their business in the US, win for an increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will be worse, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the area of the world market and their debt will also be larger.
"history shows that" quality "shares tend to overcome during the three months after the initial rate increase," said analysts at Goldman sachsve in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets ahead of the company ’ s weak balance sheet in any increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004, an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high revenue from capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also overcome their counterparts lower quality (an average of 4 percentage points) or 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of variable interest rates lose most, Goldman said.
Beyond purely stock games benefited consumers also thanks to the rising dollar.
Savers may also see their profits through higher yields, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the classic FM, claims MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "fertilizer"
Takes the view that it's increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rivals
Also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says he just cheat the British
A parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked voice and says he is not even original idea
BBC Radio 3 to "changes" in the classic FM, claims a leading parliamentarian and piling fresh pressure on broadcasting, to demonstrate that they are doing something that commercial broadcasters don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said BBC bosses, the public service radio station that seems to be "ohlupována" and is increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rivals.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word" ohlupováno "- but he seems to be turning into classic FM," he said.
Also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December of last year.
The BBC music awards, which began in the last year, seems to be the British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to mind, when in fact it only simulating what we already have on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC denied the charges on the grounds that the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival, in terms of live music and public education.
What I've learned about classical music on Radio 3 would be to any other radio station.
And their commitment to live music and making music is, in fact, on the top level.
"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and marketing to new works in service is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, argued BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey, it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before, because the British are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was the only element of the production of the BBC, which came under fire for stepping on the foot of commercial competitors during the broadcast of the Culture, Media and Sport, and they got to the hearing.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked the voice - the musical talent show, which the BBC bought from a Dutch producer Talpa media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
You can see why this programme is discussed as non-original and not especially different?
Lord hall insisted on BBC1 show - in which the September stars Paloma faith aboy George as judges - was made "in a manner typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the corporation to "found a hit of his own stables" when's next start entertaining series.
However, refused to rule out ordering more future seasons of the show the voice or spending taxpayers ’ money in royalties to other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest rate since August and guilt can be black Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month was the lowest growth recorded since the year 2000, when the records began
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that the November black Friday could be the reason for braking spending
More than a decade was a virtual shopping on the rise, thanks to him, one of many British main streets has become a ghost town.
But experts say that there are signs of stabilising online sales, and the new figures show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.

Experts say that there are signs of stabilising online sales, and the new figures show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"if you look at the level of growth in the past years and you're going back to the year 2000, the status quo will always eventually be rationalised," says Andy Mulcahy, for guardian editor IMRG sales Index.
Explains that internet sales were strengthened three years ago, when customers began to use their mobile phones to carry out the purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the couch.
But now (growth) somewhat stagnant, and therefore, it seems that is bottoming out.
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which was transposed from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers can delay purchases ahead of the event, which takes place the last Friday in November.
In the last year, five times more than average shoppers turned to their computers to make purchases over the web and dropped several vendors.
Experts believe that black Friday, shoppers bargain again, may keep customers from other purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales conducted through the Web business.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in Stone fashion stores.

The company also produces Sesame oil and roasted sesame seeds used exclusively white.
An hour can handle our press press 8 pounds sesame.
Mechanical pressing the material heats up to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for designation as extra virgin.
At higher temperatures would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil is good for diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
Czech favourite between oil is sunflower.
From research hamerské Jarmila Novotná, who led at the Masaryk University, has shown that it prefers in the warm kitchen, 43% of respondents.
In reality, however, the cooking is not suitable, at 180 ° C begins to burn through.
It's better to use it for seasoning salads and convenient particularly in the diet, which helps to prevent cardiovascular disease.
It contains a high proportion of Omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all the fatty acids most reduce cholesterol.
Problems with the heart's need to beware of the overall amount of fat and calories.
For example, in one spoon of sunflower oil is 62 calories in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil is 99 calories.
As regards the energy value of foodstuffs, it is important to realise that there are natural foods with more nutrients than the so-called empty calories.
You are part of the industrially formulated products.
It is therefore appropriate to reach for extra virgin oils.

For this designation is the highest content of Omega 3 and Omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids your body can't make itself and one must receive from food.
Particularly important is the intake of Omega 3 fatty acids.
Scientists study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that a daily intake of the substance is insufficient.

According to statistics are passionate nation grilovačů Americans.
There seems to a household 1.4 grill.
All over the world, then held a variety of barbecue contests, which only confirms the success of the culinary discipline.
Behind the Czechs are not.
On the basis of consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that a mere 4% of the people in my life negrilovala.
The vast majority of then barbecuing and several times a year.
To make the barbecue was successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - the ideal is to adapt the marinating meat several hours before the heat treatment.
That oil is the best and at the same time, the barbeque leaves health beneficial substances?
In general, the actual trial barbecue should conserve fat.
Experts agree that a large part of the oils at high temperatures begin to lose its flavour.
Healthy extra virgin oil then comes about body beneficial substances which of them otherwise we get during the consumption of the oils of the dishes prepared at lower temperatures.
But that doesn't mean that extra virgin oil find barbecue in their application.
Grape seed oil for the barbecue, health and beauty.
When you say meat, experts from the firm of Bohemia oil from the kraslic Sokolovsku comes immediately to mind grape seed oil.
Beautifully complements the taste of the masses and fish.
In the kitchen is characterised by a unique characteristics increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, because it has a high degree of incineration, when 216 ° C.
Even with such high temperature, as one of the few oils keeps health beneficial substances, describes the advantages of grapeseed oil Daniel Wolfie from the firm of Bohemia oil, which is one of the few Czech producers of this oil from the vine.
Experts agree that grape seed oil is 50 times more potent than vitamin E and 20 times more potent than vitamin c.
It also contains high levels of linoleic acid, and is effective in fighting with an excess of cholesterol.
In grape oil also takes our body important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the positive content of these substances helps reduce high blood pressure, increases the metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
The consumption of grapeseed oil also help increase our external beauty - improves the elasticity of the skin, it is used to treat acne and helps care for dry and brittle hair.
The chef's use of grapeseed oil in the kitchen pork.
Not only is suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, the seasoning salads, but also for thermal adaptation dishes.
The barbecue can be used in two ways, when marinating and grilling itself.
Marinating meat and fish keep their succulence.
In preparing the marinade must be present three components: oil, acidity and spice.
The acidity of the cider vinegar and deliver, for example, to soften the meat.
Again, spice adds flavor the meat and oil preserves and delivers the right edge, says Daniel Wolfie.
At the same time, it adds that grape seed oil for marinating is ideal because as one of the few oils can penetrate through the dark meat.
Marinated meat or fish are therefore ready to barbecue, how to proceed?
Extra virgin olive oils are characterised by the fact that in the preparation of foods are just a few drops.
The same is true for a barbecue.
Some of the oil for this method of preparation are taboo.
This concerns in particular the flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not at all warm.
Prior to the barbecue grill with oil to prevent light meals.
Barbecue is also an essential part of the preparation of the Annexes.
To grilled meat and fish goes virtually anything - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, a green salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia oil they recommend, for example, salad, hot summer.
To him you need: • 1 pack peaches • 1 bunch arugula • 1 cup sliced cucumber • 1 cup of mixed salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of grapeseed oil
In a salad bowl, add to a mixture of salad leaves, sliced cucumbers and arugula pulled on the big diced peach.
According to taste salt and pepper on me, you can also sprinkle with minced chili and soy sauce.
At the conclusion of a few drops of pokapejte of grapeseed oil.
For exceptional taste then you can gently sprinkle the salad with sliced almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: not only on medication, but also on the will of the patient to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs care expert series: neurologist, a physiotherapist, therapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
But it's not just about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultation, if they decide to have a child, to care for these sick include social advice, recommendations on housing arrangements, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient.
The more actively fight with the disease, the longer it can work and does not fundamentally change the style of his life.
Indeed, as doctors point out, the passivity of patients for the disease activity.
It is, for example, demonstrated that regular exercise significantly delaying the time when sick needs some compensatory aid such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their surroundings were not subject to various myths, such as that the disease is automatically leads to end up in a wheelchair.
And that's page have a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaigns, give yourself a chance.
The most important person in the care of patients with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis pays twice the adage that the disease starts to heal sooner, rather, your doctor may influence things.
It's because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when it's not neuro-degeneration process so strong.
The earlier we intervene, the greater the hope is that we can stop the illness and delay the debilitating, explains Dr. Eva honey from a neurological clinic General University Hospital in Prague.
It's very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitative care, which most often addresses the weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
With the sick to work according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthening the pelvic floor, mitigate swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.
"it's very individual, depending on the specific problems of the patient," says Dr. Martin kövári, the chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis may indeed suffer from the same disease, but each has a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation can't stop the illness, but always can alleviate her symptoms.
Physical activity also stimulates the immune status of the organism, which in the case of multiple sclerosis is desirable.
Another encouraging sign of regular exercise is the fact that you are sick, what can handle everything, and it reinforces their confidence.
"exercise also releases endorphins, wash and they make you feel good," notes Camilla řasová Ph.D.s from the clinic rehabilitation medicine, university hospital of Vinohrady.
The physical side of our relationship, we operate the limbic system responsible for emotion.
Right so we intervene in psyche even immune processes and disease stabilize, it adds.
"previously, these patients so-called saved, we now know that they need a targeted burden," says prof J.R. Pavel Kolar, the head of the clinic for the rehabilitation and physical medicine University Hospital in Motol.
Physical therapy is in order to be self-sufficient as long as possible, including the post.
Physiotherapists therefore cooperate with ergoterapeuty, everyone got to compensatory aid made his peace.
Many patients needs and care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When you get a serious illness in my life, most people will shake it.
Experiencing shock, panic, fear.
Must respond to a major burden - the loss of health.
With such aching souls have gone to someone, not to try to take everything on his shoulders.
"I work with them, so that it finally came to the conclusion that, even with a handicap you can live a full life and multiple sclerosis, that doesn't mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata raspberry - Schubert from the neurological clinic of the general University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague latecoere manufacturer Airbus would fly.
Aircraft production is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technologies.
The new planes are full of titanium or solid and light composite materials, which now so someone can't make and process.
Still, it's next to superpřesných, computerized machine tools, beside autoclaves for shaping the composites hit on something so mundane, such as apricot seeds.
In the drum, which recalls the pot on the cotton candy, in a pile of stones to espouse the edges of metal parts, which just came out of the frézovacího machines.
"no one has yet come up with anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of the manufacturer of air door latecoere Czech Republic.
In campus in Prague earlier Letov Vystaviste manufactures complete the door to Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world supplying the door for Brazilian Embraer 170.
The door, part of which is drawn up in Prague, also come in first and upper class passengers on the upper decks of the world's largest airliner, the Airbus A380.
They're installed here the door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the motto here.
Maybe cold-cranking keys leaves the company adjusted twice a year.
If the yellow sticker missed the record, they should be in Prague race to explain what auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who rides regularly to check if the door produced according to agreed rules.
Human senses but advanced technology not yet.
On one door into the A320 is 1,500 rivets.
You must shake nýtaři manually.
It takes them two days ago.
Even the sound of hammers to see if it's properly rivet flustered.
Tolerance, in which they move, it is the minimum.
Rivet may above the surface of the aircraft to perform from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
When it comes to a number of trained touch.
When the controller runs a finger across a row of rivets, it knows if one is out of tolerance.
Then take in hand the precise úchylkoměr.
Letov fed before 1989 L-39 training programme for military aircraft.
But in 1991 he made neither one.
The firm had to quickly find a new contract.
That's when put together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
Won the tender for the supplier of the emergency door for the A321 model.
Courtship with Boeing were not so happy.
"we were for them, then a small firm, which did not have enough money for investment and to Boeing could guarantee a long-term stable supply," recalls the outcome.
The door to the American producers would remain closed if Letov in 1999 delivered at the Prague Conference of the International Association of Aerospace Industries latecoere French group.
I was talking about our collaboration with Airbus.
The second day started negotiations with the French, says the outcome.
A year later, the Czech firm latecoere bought and companies with a new contract.
Right in 2000, started assembly of parts of the doors for the A320.
Three years later, the doors were added to the upper decks for the A380.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for processing composites for supplies for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without latecoere we ourselves to these big contracts.
Maybe we did parts or small parts.
Partners want guarantees of supply for twenty or thirty years, explains the outcome.
Last year, the Czech latecoere reached 2.9 billion turnover over and profit after tax 147 million crowns.
An exclusive position between suppliers and aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague since 2000 has invested 1.5 billion crowns.
The company must have certificates of quality, certification, 170 special production processes and certificates of qualifications for key staff.
Without them the company would make no door to the aircraft.
To obtain certificates that manufacturing processes meet customer requirements, and multiple checks to keep them standing under Dubský million crowns.
The production processes changed every year.
They are more accurate and more stringent.
We have staff, dovybavovat doškolovat equipment and again the whole process to certify the outcome, adds.
Now the firm is finalising the preparation process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the existing human health harmful cadmium.
The award was received from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology for equipment or chemicals, which are used in Prague.
People come from Boeing, will examine the concept of the entire line.
Then they show production.
Check our laboratory.
One set of samples to test themselves in his lab and then compare the results with our approach, the outcome the way customers control.
The reward is Prague firm long-term exclusive contracts.
With Prague race stands today and falling production embraerů.
For the A320 family generates half of the total volume of the door.
Replace the Czech latecoere is for the Brazilian or European producer either impossible, or very difficult.
That does not mean, however, that the door might say at any cost.
Part of the contract's price curve.
This indicates how many doors will happen after ten, fifty, hundred of pieces produced.
The price is still dropping to a certain limit value.
Into this price formula, we need to go.
If not, we'll lose money, says the outcome.
Half of the lobby, where the electrical closet assembled for military Airbus a400 m, is still empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, there is building new polorobotická line on the riveting and fitting doors for innovative model of the A320 Neo.
The riveting to accelerate and refine.
"this is the trend, which the assembly in aviation is going," adds the outcome.
Sales has secured future line.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of new A320 model.
Just a couple of yards off line for a complete fitting doors for the upper deck of the A380.
It's a strategic decision our parent company.
The aim is to reduce the time of production and reduce costs.
The full assembly could begin within two years, says the outcome.
However, the company must go through before qualification tests necessary for fitting certain electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is betting on further development of production of composite materials.
In addition to the Boeing should involve on the new Airbus A350, which will compete with the Dreamliner.
"for a company that's huge credit, when they can also process materials besides metallic composites," he says proudly, the outcome.
However, latecoere in the Czech Republic is on the edge of the production capacity.
In the area of Letov, where another place is not.
Before the entry of the French company's 180 employees.
Now has 800 and within three years there would still be about 100 more.
As long as they compete to Airbus and Boeing, how many hundreds of new aircraft, the airline order every year, may not have a job.
Although he has a contract for several years, the parent company of Prague latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group should have enough money for the September loan repayments.
Finally, latecoere could deal with major creditors.
At the end of August they traded part of the loans for shares.
Creditors in the company of a capital increase to €57.4 million share of 37.4 percent.
The debt of the company decreased by two thirds, i.e. EUR 180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company signed between existing shareholders new shares for 222,9 million euro.
She raised a total capital of EUR 280 million.
However, the group benefited from the increasing production of the Airbus and Boeing, who are involved in sales, 85 percent.
The average expected growth of about four percent per year until 2017.
In the custom book has orders for €2.6 billion, which corresponds to a four-year production.
French Media claims that latecoere, finally, after years in the VA can breathe again.
The Czech race in Prague Vystaviste is significant for the group.
The sales group contributes 16 percent.
According to the number of employees is the largest foreign branch of the group.
The deputies supported a greater share of State charges for coal.
The change in charges for the extraction of minerals is to bring to the Treasury about 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
On revenue budgets of municipalities have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee is to be higher.
In the year of the fee received from roughly 450 million kroner and the State budget of 150 million kroner.
From brown coal mining was municipalities about 200 million crowns and State 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in remuneration of extraction space with allowed mining to 1,000 kronor per hectare per year.
Income from these payments still has in its entirety belong to municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (čssd) members said that the municipalities that gain a year instead of 14 million to 100 million kroner.
The amount of mining fees won't determine the law, but it provides government regulation.
The payment will be calculated by multiplying the amount of newly harvested the mineral and rates for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, is the reason for the amendment, among other things, the possibility of flexible reactions to the current economic situation.
MP ODS Marek Benda but warned that setting the fee by government may not be in line with the Constitution.
According to the Minister, but the doctor isn't in this case because the State tax levied on mineral, which is state property.
The fees, receive only municipalities, whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep-sea mining coal will get three quarters of the money municipalities and a quarter of the State.
The same ratio will also be the case for the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money, which the State mining royalties from selects will be ring-fenced.
For example, 28 percent will have to go on damage control, after logging, mining or to ensure the emergency services.
A draft today criticized opposition MPs who claimed, in particular, that damaged municipalities affected by mining region.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and mayors), warned that mining companies no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they pay higher fees directly into the State budget.
"it is not possible to tunnel in one of the poorest regions, because the Minister of Finance to improve budget," said David Kádner (dawn) elected in ústí.
Before the surge in unemployment pro MP warned KSČM Han aulická.
Kádner and aulická unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to reject, Kučera wanted to return government to the completion of the law.
In the explanatory memorandum is that, according to mining firms to increase fees reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent of long-term contracted.
The main consumers such as power plants or CHP should therefore not feel price growth.
"on the other hand, however, this really increases the risk that mining organisations will increase reimbursements to compensate for efforts to reduce its operating expenses, which primarily means reducing the number of employees," admits the government.
It is, however, an increase in fees from the point of view of employment.
According to the rapporteur, to the novel Milana Urbana (čssd) is key to members before the approval of the law knew the conclusions on the updated Energy Concept, and especially the government's decision about the limits on coal mining.
If coal will also benefit the limits, then it will have implications for the proceeds for the State and municipalities, he pointed out.
Urban disagrees with Mládek, in that the decision of the breaking down of the Czechoslovak army should fall until after 2020.
Limits on the CSA down, he says, should break it for social reasons, and because of the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
The time for a decision on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The whole world is watching how the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision about whether raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists contacted by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve will take the decisions, now thinks it will stay dormant for some time, and still retain the interest rate in the range of 0-0,25 percent.
It's a historic event, because he passed years from the moment when the Fed cut rates to zero.
The first time we're approaching a situation where the central bank might be able to get out of the bar to zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates, "says Angel ubide, manager at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The American economy is doing relatively well, the recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the State account and only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore less pink global perspective.
Markets have been warned to be prepared for the increase, but the circumstances indicate that he also sees a big chance against that step.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday, 20: 00 CET.
Shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who on Monday he shot his girlfriend in Mississippi - and later the same day, even your colleague - wrote a message in which he says he's "Sorry" the first murder and that she wished she could take it back, revealed on Tuesday the government offices.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months out of the game for a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of the right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender leaving this injury in tears and knocked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive, thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
Injuries caused by reckless intervention - Moreno in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw pushed his way into the area of PSF.
Nine minutes was treated on the field and was also needed an oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "he suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
Will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the next day and then further surgery in Manchester.
It's terrible - the boy who comes to Manchester in 18 years, it's very hard, but he's playing fantastic, and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he was also wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of therapy and wouldn't be able to play in the group stage.
I believe that he will play again this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli Mexican punished.
Van gall hinted that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for themselves whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly surgery on both legs.
A tweet from the account, Shaw says: "thank you everyone for all their news," words cannot express how I ruined my road to recovery begins now and come back even stronger. "

English defender will have added motivation to recovery in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip coke, coach of PSV, he said: "it was a very nasty wound."
If any player leaving the field with such injuries, everyone is very sad.
It's never the aim of our players to hurt the opposition.
Moreno suffered a fracture to his feet in the game for Mexico against van Gaal's Holland at the World Cup 2014.
"it's very difficult for him, because his intention was not to hurt opponents, and when you hear about the severity of such injuries, it's not good," said coke.
I wasn't able to see this moment.
I just saw the ball, who was heading in the other direction, so it seemed that touched him [Moreno], but I haven't seen surgery on Luke.
In an interview for the sbs6 Moreno stated: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult it can be such a thing.
I feel very badly, I'm very sorry.

David Cameron certainly knows the Lorax better?
This thing every parent knows: when you fall in love with a book, it doesn't take long before you'll teach her almost by heart.
However, this must not be David Cameron.
The children's drawings, the service providers to name a favorite childhood book, chose the President of the government, the Lorax, Dr. Seuss story from 1971.
It was hard to choose, says Cameron in a report published on the website of the company supercamps and continues: "funny, touching, creative and with strong content, so I like to read to their children, because it was always the image or message, which I haven't seen before."
Well, except that in the following paragraph Cameron allegedly described the book as the lift from the film of 2012, added more characters and details to fill the brief original text.
"in town thneed-ville walled, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by complying with her wishes to see a real tree," is a summary of the content of the book, which is the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that alone wasn't enough suspicious text supplied Cameron reads like a summary of the film the Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "in town thneed-ville walled, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would meet with the plot of the book, where the unnamed young man knows that greed is destroying the local nature, trees, removing industrialista Once-ler, who despite the protests the cover loraxe, crouched, mustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely so relatively few significant PR Task got sidekick, who never read the Lorax child 20 times in a row.
A spokesman for Downing Street indicated that the text probably came from the office of Cameron.
Supercamps confirmed that text provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam lyth was in danger, but the omission of England still holds
Compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England selected for this tour, it will be under me repeating 3-0 defeat suffered last time in a test series, not very likely.
I'd also directly rule out winning guests.
Party Alastair Cook may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup, and also the collective thinking is strong; bear the scars of 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball, moeen Ali emerging spinner and Adil Rashid, although it is unknown to level the test series, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam lyth fell out of the England team experienced in the series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
Decision to omit Adam lytha for me is hard to analyse, because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests was against two good attacks in challenging conditions and simple, but the harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on the basis of performance.
For instance, around the names Joe root were no question marks, which led to the announcement, because — and this I've already stated previously — players are their best'but.
A few other half-century and lyth could extend his series, but it had control over its own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, it's another opportunity.
The main England coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position even though his performances were not completely 100%, and it doesn't surprise me; he's always been a team player.
The question of how much time he gets test batsman, to show he is a tough nut to crack.
Lyth got seven caps — as well as Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance at home and abroad.
The only thing for which you might gripe, is that England did in the Caribbean first chance Jonathan trottovi — though lyth was in the best form — but this wasted opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales comes and it's batter, whom I rate very positively.
It's x-faktorový cricketer, whom we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when we get on the field against 236 Trent Bridge that so little was done.
He must at least be afforded the same opportunity, one given to his predecessors, but all this will of course depend on the overall lineup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, when moeen begins alongside cook, which would have got the extra spinner while retaining four quicks were raised and I have no reservations against it.
I don't understand why strokemaker cannot hit left-handed and this man has already demonstrated that it is an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was the number 3 for them and a big difference in it.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played their first 38 tests before his performance in 2001.
He immediately have accomplished three century and never looked back.
The team comes as a back-up spinner Zafar Ansari and when I had the chance to follow him, took me as a very impressive young man.
People can watch his crude statistics — an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball — and see it as a ferry, but not a lot of spinnerů who raised their hands, and selektoři opted for youth.
A lot on this tour.
Outside the team, it appears that England made a few changes and smart addition to their coaching staff.
The appointment of batsman mahela jayawardenea, from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches can be a masterstroke.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who bring experience that have experience with all the conditions and all of the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part white-ball tour and bring into the team as energy, so ruthless a spark.
I always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and as mahela has intellect, which can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are consistent voices saying things which have been said earlier, may occasionally lighten and freshen up the atmosphere.
Collyho Durham team-mate Ben Stokes got the day off, as well as root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this Decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and generate selektoři timetable.
And you have to remember, as the players that their job depends on results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
Brexit campaign could win, if the economy starts to stagnate until 2017.
Half-baked David Cameron's renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with each passing day without election genius Jeremy "is that a yes or no?" Corbyn to the head of the Labour Party, or will take you to the TUC on Tuesday to hand the whole situation around Europe.
Foreigners are also his corbyna and Nigel faragese.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained, as Europe is mired in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British egocentric agenda, dividing concessions and disruptive changes to the Treaty, which mostly didn't want.
At its Annual Meeting in Brighton with the TUC decided that they don't want it even if eroding social protection.
We can even call it a selfie agenda Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor goes to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, they take a picture in front of the famous local monument, with or without the local dignitaries, and then returns home with the words that win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to wear nezahleděnou Britain in European Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some myopic ministers and officials in some major cities to get to a point where we left them on the matter.
Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, is carefully balanced ally, but have been in power for 10 years and he wants to leave his post, before it becomes wrong, as it has for too long continuous Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand and Kohl (14) (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
Also his power is waning.
Poland may soon have the nationalist government on the right-hand side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how breaking legs to help the selfie of the Britons, who could better invest your energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want to, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these may be planning ministers deliberately unhelpful remarks style SNP during the referendum campaign in 2017 the UK to accelerate the process of Brexit, says a friend.
"the renegotiation solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value from negotiations."
Europeans to its own injury knows how ferocious Fleet Street may be and how the EU are skeptical of the press barons, oligarchs, because they weren't inspired by Tony Benn during the referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973, in a ratio of 2: 1.
You may vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, dishonest euro-oportunistu, who made his name as a Brussels correspondent "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his vanity Ed Miliband knew its enemies.
Included a mixture of bad taxes, non-payment of foreigners hackujících phones and pseudo nezámořské departments, which owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, about them Tony Blair thought the same thing, but he realized that when you're in a cage with violent gorilla, she must throw bananas, to give you to dinner and then to tea.
In fact, it was Miliband more like Blair than Blair himself, when he said Cameron ’ s referendové routine, since Blair admitted principle repealed the constitution of the EU, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and acquired his card being fired.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who on Monday in Westminster a friendly pat on the back - I told him that he must not waste time on me - seems to be in danger of accepting strategy boycott Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy involving the media, not me, but I'm sure with Andrew Marr, whose chair at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin official attitude towards Europe, I say it nicely, develops.
Claims that he wanted to stay in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the rabid UKIP tendencies and wild shores Tory's little englanderismu can certainly accede.
The same Hilary said "bemm, but no benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner boy scout couldn't bring herself to admit that abrazivního corbynovo Appointment of McDonnell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father fought on TV about his allegiance, without going too far and lost his job.
The game Hillary was much more attractive.
But to fight for it, to stay "in all circumstances" - bennina phrase - apparently it wasn't, what McDonnell said, nor what JC said colleagues and members on their private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the background, any sensitive image that Corbyn wants to communicate - don't forget, he touched me - Discipline Reports remains important in ages televising all day and particularly in faith, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal, which are social media
Is it fair for Cameron not to provide a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider aid workers party in referendové campaign for granted, as stated by McDonnell.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But mcdonnellovo and corbynovo basic equivocation about membership of the EU - in accordance with their besiegers Bennite economy anti-kapitalistickou past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion between leftist dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences is the central principle of the doctrinal bickering.
As with his rationalization about NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that it doesn't want to terminate the campaign JC - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin to spend political capital - are also suspicious voters - concessions for Britain when it seems pointless?
The United States are already quite disappointed from the British "weak military power in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, and even in reducing the costs of the Conservative government in power, as I was reminded on Monday night the start of something, what was the name of the Security Forum of British influence.
Experts criticise the electronic Review published by public health England
A statement by the government funded agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking, came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links with the tobacco industry, the researchers argue.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet criticized the evidence used in its report on electronic cigarettes by public health England (Phe).
The Agency published the Phe "mezníkovou" report last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
But a few researchers questioned the robustness of the data and highlighted links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in The Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy base", on which the Agency Phe based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ, challenged the claim, which was supposedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "the fundamental principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of efficacy."
They indicate that the general public might expect, that's a statement of the Agency, which Phe is "the current best estimate is that the e-cig are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting convened 12 people to develop multi-kritéria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their views on damages associated with the different products containing nicotine; the results were summarized in a research report.
McKee and capewell points out that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called euroswiss health whose CEO allegedly has previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent study.
Also endorsed the credentials of public health bat in the sustainability report, States.
One of 12 participants in the meeting said funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but no financing, which reportedly earned previously from a tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for the selection of members of the panel is not available, but contains several known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of which also claim in the paper industry funding.
Some of the others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
Phe also attended the meeting in tobacco control.
The report arising in this group "eloquently admits" missing "hard evidence about the evils of most products on most of the criteria," wrote McKee and capewell.
However, none of these references or restriction is not described in the Phe report.
McKee and capewell said that Phe claims that "so far, there is no evidence that the e-cig acted as a path to smoking for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at phe, said that the allegations in the BMJ was answered earlier.
He said: "electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
Phe has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and what also displayed, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative risk compared with tobacco.
Almost 80 000 people a year die from diseases related to smoking and smoking cost the NHS £2 billion a year.
A clear emphasis on current evidence - that even if the e-cig are not without risk, carry only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fill our national competence.
The BBC should end up with EastEnders, says former director of Channel 4
Former director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as Eastenders and the voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would give their right arm "for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programmes which are not made of other British television.
BBC criticised for her public service programmes, which will likely see only a handful of people, in the complex broadcasting times compared to his rivals "biggest rating show, and on channels such as bbc4.
After Director General Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said, he was trying without success to the connection with the BBC for six years, which worked on Channel 4.
"I struggle with the idea that the BBC and broadcasting programmes that would surely have been broadcast rivals without the contributions of the state," Johnson said in the Commission for the communication in the upper house, as part of the discussions on the future of the BBC.
If you can keep your licence fees, which, I'm not sure whether they are in the medium or long term is a good idea, should reduce the production of at least as regards the other programmes, which produce or not.
The voice broadcast in prime time, because they want to gain the widest possible support in the future.
The idea that no one else would not be broadcast, it's ridiculous joke, and, of course, nonsensical.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programmes, which may be funded bezpříspěvkově.
The voice is one of them, EastEnders next, and, of course, produced on home soil.
Honestly other channels for them would be just right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting service.
I don't think it would in no way weaken the BBC.
Johnson, a businessman in the field shows that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that they feel guilty by gaining ratings "for the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comment about the popular BBC show repeats those former Sky Executive Director, Tony ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC sells a show like EastEnders.
Johnson said that even hýčkanější public service programmes the BBC "passes on bbc4, where quite often cannot be measured audience, but its power and can argue when they embark on their mission of false justification for £4BN income from royalties," but of course we are doing all these obscure programmes, to which no one is looking. "
It is broadcast at a time when no one's looking at them.
As for the licence fee to the Commission, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find regresivnější system about who gets the best value out of him.
Of course we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people for whom £150 is a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much, because on the BBC not so much.
The former director of the sky and Channel 5, David elstein, who spoke before the Commission on Tuesday, said that the BBC should revise its reithovskou mission in the sense of "inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that the BBC was now a small volume of production has previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take a model for public public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, explain and talk."
On the partnership elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms, which was aired on TV only a handful, and connect with commercial reporters, so we can all see online.
“sonogenetika ’ or control brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound pulses affect the direction of nematodes.
Scientists bred worms with genetically modified the nervous system, which can control the sound waves.
Tiny nematodes changing direction at a time when they are affected by sound impulses, which are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses are working so that they switch cells genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists reported that these worms are a perfect example of the new methodology called sonogenetika, which uses ultrasound to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells and activate cells outside the body.
Sreekanth chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, explained to the guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - invasive procedure, in which the patient's brain electrodes that stimulate the brain lymphoma-specific. Such method is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson ’ s disease.
Nematodes usually on ultrasound chalasani intact, but found that the reaction will be when it is placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found, bubbles are intensifying ultrasonic waves, which then passes through the body of the worms.
Enhanced ultrasound waves operate in trp-4 ion channels, which are located in the membranes of certain cells of the worms.
He used sound waves to these channels open and activate cells to which they are linked, according to a report in the journal Nature communications.
To control nematodes using ultrasonic waves, chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain trp-4 ion channels.
Then, when he used the modified worms ultrasound, the sound waves were strengthened mikrobublinami and transferred to the worms, where on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is much like optogenetice, groundbreaking instrument, which enables scientists to neurons on and off using light.
Chalasani, but left to hear that sonogenetika could have compared to many of the benefits of this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent to the optical fibre to the desired location in the brain may ultrasonic waves penetrate tissues without restrictions and be sent directly into the brain.
"we believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target the human neurons and make them susceptible to temporarily ultrasonic signals used in clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases," said chalasani.
He added that his application would method also found in the treatment of muscle cells and the cells producing insulin.

Ads embarrassing British arms trade.
Look at the video about protizbraňovém market from Amnesty International.
Formidable killer drones!

High-explosive rounds!

A cheerful voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that advertising on the world's largest arms fairs is sharp parody created for amnesty international to highlight the willingness of the British government selling arms to repressive regimes across the defence and security equipment International jamborees in the Excel centre in London's Docklands.

They toyed with the creation of more realistic risky corporate advertising, but "adding bright colours and animation, I achieve that will attract more people."
"they did a fantastic job and help us raise concerns about selling nelegálích torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in the amnesty.
What we need now is to the United Kingdom Government has adopted measures and ensure that illegally traded with torture facilities on our doorstep.

Eight golden rules for student life on campus

No culture permits you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship continued, but I need you to leave, to go back to the energy I had used to talk with you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socialization - and maybe write him a knock.
Speaking of: knock knock.
One kid in my dorm had a habit of that, if the doors are locked, it's invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to baking.
Because you started going to university at the top of baking mania, knocking on a stranger's door and show with plate upečenými cakes seems slightly less weird, less than "welcome to the neighbourhood, I baked you, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering home-cooked treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommate will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe it's all over, so that your face is assigned to the succulent surprises.
It is, of course, the subject that you're a decent Baker.
Wrong condensed pieces of flour, sugar and jams, that will probably lead the others pretend to sleep, if you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is common crime on college campuses.
The theft of the whole chicken, of course, is a crime, but it's a little bit of milk to your tea theft?
Check it twice with the owner of the milk.
There is a chance that the milk you offer even if they are inside the rampage.
If someone steals something, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little bit more mature than my roommate, who swapped my milk for the dishwashing liquid to punish thieves.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't make noises, which distracts people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also notoriously people in glass houses.
A girl from my hall asked her neighbors if they could down a little drum and bass because there were 3 in the night and in the morning she had a test.
Their answer was to amplify the music.
When it finally fell silent at 5 o'clock in the morning, let them sleep for two hours and then let out loud his own music, locked the door and left on his three-hour exam.
It would be romantic if your future husband went to the same college as you?
And on the contrary, it would be awfully embarrassing if you mistook the roommate for his future wife, slept together, split up and they had to see each other every day, and it might also take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try to talk to at least a little bit with his groin.
The sublime moment when you realize that someone had left the keys in their unlocked room, is only a fine line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable lesson and amusing about their security by hiding something - never don't ruin someone's room and toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door for them and give them the keys to the bottles with water, then put in the freezer - but they aren't their stuff to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva is looking forward to the twins, despite the uncertain outlook for the future.
Eve's been through some rough times already during pregnancy with seven-year-old vítkem today.
His father broke up with her, and for the preparation and raising the child was alone.
I dealt with the situation relatively quickly - so I'm looking forward to the baby and I was looking at the positives.
Uncertainty and by being alone with a child, I tried not to.
And I'm sure I had hope that long, we are not alone, says Eva today for their first pregnancy.
Then she met on the Internet to the cabin older Vasek, who had started to talk about popular movies.
Vasek Eva with vítkem even brought him home from the hospital, but in the role of my stepfather was too hasty.
"for a time, then pulled out of the programme," she described Eva in the documentary series four in that 3.
A third series of Czech TV series is just the pursuit of happiness at the second attempt.
Vitek care and financial security families cope with a part-time job and a big help mothers and aunts bailouts.
Even the prospect of responsibility for someone else's child eventually Vaska's affection for Eva spoil.
Definitely got together around vítkových second birthday and he now understands Vasek as his dad and also address him as such.
Although he has two adult daughters Vasek, fatherhood in sixty under their words used and children are also more.
Besides Vitek added another two years and I'm finally even twins.
"Vasek into our family into the kind of naturally, maybe even by the relationships that my mother didn't talk much," he thinks the smiling Eva.
Few places?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and ELA was born by cesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis in pregnancy.
It is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which then in excessive quantities are found in the blood of pregnant women, and in particular the itching.
The disease is dangerous for unborn fetus facing premature birth and death for mothers after childbirth usually resolve spontaneously.
EMA and ELA to Eva's and Vaska's luck they were born healthy, even if they were only in the 36th week.
Emičku placed in an incubator at the intermediate ward, where he works and vaškova niece, which made her take and accommodate.
Elinka was larger and right after the transfer of the ICU room I had it in her possession, describes the difficult period after giving birth to Eva.
In the maternity ward spent 20 days, until doctors nesvolili with release of babies, who had managed to reach the border of two pounds.
Waiting for the weight gain in children in maternity Eva joy but it didn't.
"I was mad with longing after her husband and children," recalls the difficult moments on the department puerperium quadruple mother.
She and her husband even signing a statement of liability due to, inter alia, necitlivému approach one of the doctors.
But it finally happened and the doctors released Eva with the twins into a care home.
The stories of four pregnancies and births sends CT1 on Tuesday night at 21: 45 hours.
Large family can downsize.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with the electric dvouplotýnkou and crowded conditions.
A house had increased, but Vasek did Eve joy is mounted gas cookers to food preparation for six people more comfortable.
When will nejůř, we take turns on a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive in particular family fun and pleasant atmosphere, and no size or shabbiness cottage.
For now, we're piecing together very well, better than we expected.
Although the mess worse hides in a small space and kutalející babies are sometimes, but at least we're all around, smiling, Eva, who can find a positive side to every situation.
Vaškova work lighting in a movie is no guarantee of regular income.
That's why sometimes goes out into the streets as a taxi driver.
In his 60 years in the care of family finances and children physically can, but how long is it going to be?
"I realize that given our age difference that I'm the one who's going to support this family," admits Eva straight when asked about the future.
She'd like to go back to work, but more still attracts the possibility her own business.
With four kids, I'm not a bargain for the employer.
If the worst comes to the worst, we can take turns with her husband, joking about a nice blonde.
Apple had a yo-yo effect.
For everything they can display.
Faster processor, a camera with higher resolution, stronger chassis or speech-recognition force touch display, it is in a nutshell the priority recently presented the ninth generation of iPhones.
The two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6S and 6s plus.
Apple's current trend has been that each new generation iPhone is easier than the previous one.
The exception were only the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to the previous iphonům.
Dvougramový weight difference to the detriment of the news was truly negligible.
It's the new iPhone, however, far from being the case.
Iphonům compared to last year's 6 and 6 plus the mass had grown at the smaller model about 14 grams for bigger then about 20 grams.
On the one hand, no wonder last year's affair bending in pockets, apple racked up considerably.
The chassis of the news is so resilient aluminium alloy 7000, which also reflect the weight.
But the much bigger impact they have on her display.
The apple news used 3D touch technology, which can display the power of touch.
It was necessary to display another layer of capacitive sensors.
Mass displays of new iPhones as compared to previous generations increased by more than double.
At the smaller iPhone originally from 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of larger then from 19 to 40 grams.
The iPhone 6s is so display the hardest component.
Weight only 143 grams is then for this news achieved thanks to a treadmill, which touched on most of the remaining components.
The larger model is then applied to the heaviest element of batteries, its weight, however, compared with predecessors didn't change.
Even in this case, it is the biggest increase in apparent just for display.
Mass 5.5 "iPhone 6s plus is 192 grams.
How will the new display technology practical to use.
The first users will be able to test it on the Friday September 25, when launched in selected countries will sell iPhones 6S and 6s plus.
The flakes are breakfast of champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta paglicci, archaeologists have made a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of modern human habitation here from different times, including wall paintings, remains of tools, and so on and so forth.
In the stratum 23a, which is dated instruments until around 30 years ago but scientists discovered but something very like the remnants of breakfast buffet.
In fact, the traces of oat grains, which obviously went through a process of production, so popular today flakes.
The grains first wet, then dry today, get rid of the packaging, the so-called glumellae, then steamed and rozlisují flat.
Cave in paglicci were able to discover grains, which was apparently nahřáta or buried, and then he probably crushed between two millstones - at least suggest the use of tracks on two stones in a cave.
The scientists thus failed in its publication for the magazine PNAS demonstrate that the cave was a complete production process, but the similarity is striking.
We have no evidence about how people could eat cereal, but the theory that it was with some fluid and maybe even warm, of course, offers a completely logical.
At the same time, it's a very interesting document of how intensely people use cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If it is vločková interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes overtaken agriculture about twenty thousand years.
New reports of stations in the city of Brno.
So I listened once again to report the names of the stops in the trolleybus: hnusáčkova, ghost, frázova, spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was somewhat louder, so reports the male voice was slightly less comprehensible than before, when the station reported in a female voice.
A woman's voice is higher, so the noise of traffic is more recognizable than the deeper man's voice.
Although dpmb.cz argues that this anchor chose passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but I'm sure it collected from the studio recordings made in silence, which of course sounded quite differently than in the noise of the bus engine.
I live in Brno a few decades, so the correct names of all those zastávkek I know by heart, so I don't need this report, but foreigners from elsewhere in Brno novices and for which these reports are intended in particular, may be confused and may on the final, where they accidentally, then claim that the stop, which should get out of the car, was not reported.
Maybe he should get the choice of speaker - but better anchor again - do it again, and this time tinged with normal traffic noise and engine noise, in which the speaker croaking in the bus almost loses.
We didn't have to keep listening to the names of the stations, water heršpice šmírova, or then dive in creaking šalině, to which I transferred in VW.
I suppose that my old hearing worsened suddenly so much during that one day, when the announcer stops changed.
Before that day I understood the reports quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the notes traťováka.
Not many people know what the biggest and brightest the government parties were the so-called comprehensive background checks.
I took the liberty to reminisce.
The bus was late.
The dispatcher's office I ran into at the moment when the voice on the radio, that's just seven hours.
"you're lucky, that you hit with Comrade Chief, came a minute before you, and it seems that's not in the mood," said the dispatcher, while I'm writing in a log book.
Thanks, I'll watch it.
Write me, that I'm going after the districts for the revision of the small mechanisation.
It won't work, today they are vetting.
They are all shitting bricks.
What's it all about?
"you'll see," said the dispatcher.
Next you'll be too.
I ran out to the corridor.
Then the door opened and he appeared náčelnikárny chief.
Uptight, deadpan, in an impeccably tailored uniform.
"good morning, Chief, sir," I said politely, and quickly switched the two buttons on his uniform jacket.
"good morning," came the reply, and I quickly ran to the second floor, I realized I was cold, the ominous tone of old, he said.
"you're messing with," welcome me engineer Eva, an elderly lady, which I appreciated.
She said she was even chief than her comrades deposed.
They are vetting, and you get barely.
How many times have I asked, what are you a comprehensive background check, but one doesn't really want to talk about.
They tend to be once every three years, must the rest of them, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
He said, however, I see.
I pulled out of the drawer in the file with periodic reports and then phone.
"holcman here, come to me," said the chief's voice.
What is that?
Now we've met, and not... "I muttered, but no one answered me, each with just your thoughts.
"good morning, Comrade Chief, I came to your order," I barely omeldoval I entered náčelnikárny.
Chief sat behind the desk and a clipboard.
"comrade mechanizátore," he said after a moment, he lifted his head and still looking closely at that paper, "your behaviour doesn't appeal to me."
He dropped the paper on the table, leaned back in his chair and stared at me watching the usual, unpleasant, bad, piercing.
I faltered.
What's going on?
Yesterday, his deputy, said that for a few months in office I worked very well and is very happy with me.
The Chief did very well when he pulled me out of the squad for the long-haul event.
And now this?
You realize you're techniques to track distance and it must behave.
Such a greeting, like you used this morning, is simply unacceptable.
I stammered that using a greeting from my childhood, I was brought up that way and I don't see anything wrong with it.
The chief that was like a red rag to a turkey.
"you're on socialist rail and the only acceptable greeting is an honour," said the chief of petulance.
And besides, you're still addressing superiors.
Once you say "sir" and the second time again "comrade".
But I'm not Mr. Chief, but the chief comrade.
Deputies are comrades, deputy chief traťmistři are comrades chief traťmistři!
You mind!
Excuse me, sir... sir, but I salute you normal civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... it's an honour and a job, or comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...
"it's not your priority, you're not in the cold side," said the chief, who had calmed down a bit.
Still talking about that.
Anyway, remember that the chair up you don't have a prepaid retirement.
It wasn't good.
When the chief said someone, something that is not his priority, with the concerned it didn't look good.
For a moment he glared at me, cold, piercing and I searched for words I said.
It also annoyed me his haughty first names.
He was just a few years older and playing God, actually soudruhaboha.
A jovial, pompous, arrogant, authoritarian, as it suited the moment.
All to be even more.
Well, it's the chief.
Actually, not all of them, the President of the party organisation he like all straníkům, but even nestraníkům, informally.
But the chief informally to many, especially those in which he could exert his superiority.
Just wipe off me now for complete bullshit.
I thought about my ass and it cost me enough composure to shoot him in the face.
But I didn't come back to ride the picks, let alone doing it anymore Official for railways.
What do I feed two kids?
And out of the house!
I was ready to cry but I controlled myself.
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
"that's all for now, you can go," said the chief of the audience and began again inspected the paper, which had been in the hands.
At 11: 30 she called me.
Everyone from the office were already there and on what issues, and how, they said, yeah, that would be good.
Just jožin pointedly said, as was his wont, we can't all out, because he would have had to do the job Comrade Chief himself, with his followers, and that there was no danger.
The word "comrade" pointed out, as if he knew what me old wiped this morning.
In náčelnikárně was a nice reunion.
Comrade Chief behind his desk and at a long conference table the other comrades, who had to decide about my way of existence or non-existence.
Cadre, President Roh, reporter from personnel officer for special purposes, something on the way to war, and Deputy kontráše, my boss.
And also the most important person, the President of the party organisation.
I knew him from the road.
A track worker podbíjel sleepers or pitchfork thrown gravel.
But also a former guard.
There were rumours at the time that it wasn't any fun, says a big beast.
Tongues, they argued that school came in seventh grade, no more trade, no he couldn't.
And when the prison was canceled, ended up on the Sunday-afternoon picks.
But, comrade, that yeah, comrade was forged.
Chief motioned for me to sit.
My heart in my throat, nespolknutelná cone.
Read the opinion from the cadre of the civil Committee of the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two kids, and so on and so forth.
So far, so good, I thought, and I breathe a little better.
Then the opinion of the street party organisation.
This reflects the opinion of the Committee, is the same person wrote both.
But then it came!
Parents are longtime members of the party, refused to appear before the Commission and, subsequently, a revision from the speakers, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked sharply at me.
Cadre noticed and stopped reading.
The chief indicated that he should continue.
The rest was just worse.
I was a member of the municipal committee of the SSM, and there I was obtained for the candidate of the party.
Regardless of the parents, who are from the speakers, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and a wedding in addition to the National Committee, I was also in the church.
I trust the parties failed in the worst way.
That's why I was deleted from the ranks of its candidates.
But it wasn't enough!
I had two children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I said a church funeral, although that was a former member of the party.
All that I show negative attitude to the party leadership.
When finished, the chief's personnel manager only pencil tapping the table, punctuated by silence.
Everyone was staring at me and I wish I was somewhere far, far away.
I kept repeating to himself "communists - supermen, communists - supermen." what have I got myself into?
Why I stayed in the Smiths?
Repair switches as I can without some crappy clearances.
But now?
Railway Official took his career before it began.
To return to the squad?
It probably won't work, the chief me for an hour.
"comrade, how were you checked here present comrade?" interrupted the silence the chief question at a cadre.
Well, according to the report from previous employment.
You have him here?
It was obviously not kádrovákovi twice.
Beads of sweat on the forehead, blinking nervously, as if he himself was prověřovaný.
He nodded vigorously and handed the chief some paper.
"well," the chief said with a hint of joviality, but which was often a harbinger of storms.
At first glance, nothing but praise, trained with honors, he graduated from college, he worked as a locksmith piecework, standard filling on average, a hundred and twenty percent.
But it is essential.
Where did you get that opinion, comrade? "turned again to a cadre, who felt that it kind of starts to turn against him and that would very soon you might not even be kádrovákem.
This comrade gave it to me at onset.
That was enough for you?
"well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to the crew," the cadre.
And there are opinions not required, his was, somehow, so I gave it to a folder.
"so the inclusion in the technical functions you this piece of paper," the chief said.
Cadre blinked nervously and didn't have the answers.
"never mind, we'll discuss it later," said Chief business and kádrovákovi looked relieved.
For now, take it.
"so what with you, comrade?" the Chief turned to me again.
Suddenly vyká me, so it's over!
In the eyes of my mind went blank, I felt the heat.
Burst of remorse and accusations, and I knew it was the ugliest creature on earth that does not deserve the slightest mercy.
That by planting an incomplete report I misled comrade cadre examiner, while I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I got it from a cadre at the factory.
I also antisocialistický element, which at the time of building socialism supports the religious obscurantism, or even participate in them.
That was a lot of everything that I've committed, or maybe even commit and I silently prayed for it to end.
I didn't care.
I was one out of my place mechanizátora.
I was one, I think they'll take the pick.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not an enemy of the people, which in my eyes Comrade Chief was.
"that's enough, sir," said the party chairman and chief's levity interrupted.
This comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake right bullshit did!
But he already got his punishment.
Forget it, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young person, than that on his time we close the door to the side!
To be opened again, he will have to prove he has changed, that is worthy of our trust again.
An uneducated hack talking like a book.
Where did that come from?
She's so well-read or parroted phrases from partisan training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must get away from us a chance!
A chance to prove that he's changed.
And who does give it to him, if not just you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade, support in his efforts to remedy!
It's your party, which you'll never be rid of it.
Actually, it's also party to all of us.
This comrade must see that his party didn't.
Being a good mother not only punished, but that she also loves.
When the president finished, no one said a word.
Such a turnaround situation no one expected.
At least I do.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade Chairman," Ice chief said in an effort to regain the initiative.
If you'd let me finish, you heard that I was going to just such a conclusion.
All nod their heads, but it was evident that he doesn't believe a word of it.
"so I was confirmed for the independent examiner care about basic resources," I shouted back to the office and then I began to cry.
Another addition to the engineers, Eve, they were all at lunch.
She listened in silence my incoherent makeup fresh experiences and I had calmed down.
When I finished, she asked whether the coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, put water on the stove and cups.
Meanwhile, vented about kádrováckých practices.
How one opinion, often full of praise, give a man in the arm, and the second, in which any dirt, they send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to, but a Sunday-afternoon picks, and comrades from the factory didn't know where to send it to.
And our cadre?
He's just old, where what he ate or drank, and so it turned out, as it turned out.
"it's from an old gets it," she said mischievously.
Today he won't like it.
Still, watch out for him, he's very vindictive.
And party chairman?
In fact, far worse chief, no philanthropist.
Zero from the picks with great power.
Boiled water for coffee, and then just in the office was filled with the smell of coffee.
I threw the cup a sugar cube and silently mixing hot potion.
Perhaps I'm out of the woods.
Now kick me and other reviews are for three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief me that today he won't soon forget.

Symbol of life.
Bike moose over chlumem after years of spinning again.
To see them from far away, because it is situated on the fifteen feet tall flagpole.
People from a wide area they call him "the fan Chlum."
For the municipality to 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the municipality acquired the opportunity to natives reunion in 2010.
"we requested was about character and the character of Course fan we want, everyone knows it," said Mayor George Masek.
Chlumské wind pump is local technical monument.
It's kind of memento: currently recalls a time when the people here fought for good quality drinking water.
The Chlum in centuries past was a rarity.
When in 1910 decided chlumští representatives for a solution that suited then until the mid 1980s.
In a village at the mouth of the cave číchov left seven meters deep well.
Three years later they were joined by a metal structure with a wind pump, which benefited from the water in the reservoir at the highest point of the municipality, near the church.
"the construction has Anthony d border from Moravia cargo 2 400 crowns," says Memorial inscription on the pedestrian fence construction flagpole.
The pump after a few corrections and wipeouts windmill broke down in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, then started writing a new chapter in the fight for water: that day in Chlum started to serve a new pipe.
Wind pump have remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a rarity here.
Dominating work at this year's reunion natives.
When in 2008 the chlumští decided that wind fix bike again and again to bring into operation.
One made a replica of the original wheels - reduced on average by half a metre.
The bike was fitted to the mast, that same year, however, have to be put down.
The manufacturer did not reply suitable material and bike couldn't resist the wind.
After several years of dominant Odlezelské jezero was dismantled under the roof.
From June this year, however, the bike on a tall pole is spinning again.
On the occasion of the reunion natives left municipality replica wheels edit osadila him again and again and again to the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws water from the well to overflow blind shoulder.
And over the summer it was completely cut off because the well water was scarce.
At least turned up empty.
"in the autumn then shaft the windmill from pumps in the suction basket off again," explained Mayor Masek.
Chlum isn't the only municipality in the Czech Republic, where the wind got round to the municipal character, however, is the only member of this kind throughout the Highlands.
Similar element in their character to honor local technical monuments such as the chvalkovicích and Green Mountain on vyškovsku in Kuzelov on hodonínsku, partutovicích on fantasies or on the shelf at vsetínsku.
No offense, but I don't know, she admitted lafatu rock Tripoli goian.
"the fight against match I remember very well, even my goal, as in all my career," grinned the 34-year- goian at the pre-game press conference.
Then coached us georghe Hagi, it was unfortunate that we lost.
I hope I score now Sparta.
Except that this time we will not, "said goian.
This man, who has played 60 games for Romanian representation, is a key pillar of the Greek team.
A shortstop will face raids Spartan offensive.
It comes a few thousand people, no hell, says about the Greek duel Spartan hop.
And partly, he knows what he can expect on Thursday night.
Well known fataie, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Luciano.
In that time, I saw all their games.
I know it's a very good striker, too, which is why he went to Sparta, said goian.
Another footballer Prague club name, and then came the direct question if he even knows David lafatu, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and lightly with a reproachful look he was aiming at Czech journalists.
Clueless expression on his face marked: "why are you asking me this?"
After a moment of silence, he said.
We saw some videos, and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot as a team.
He's got really good players.
And lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone else besides fataie.
The Spartans about goianovi knows very well.
"my experience of the larger clubs, you can tell he's holding asterasu defense, it's their Games Organizer," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav hob.
Goian has had the best years behind him, but boasts a very interesting football curriculum.
Its time to care for him, Borussia Dortmund - Stuttgart, both Manchester United and city, units of steauy but headed into the Italian Palermo, also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're aggressive and unusual style, says coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing The European cups, he fights for victory in the Czech League.
For me, it's the favorite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want the group to launch a good result.
Like Sparta, we try to win, said goian.
I'm in the room with the Slovak goalie Tomas košickým, which on an opponent from the Czech Republic enjoyed a lot.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.

Test the objectivity of Czech Television in informing the migrantské crisis.
Another little test of objectivity and balance of the main Czech news media about the refugee crisis.
This time the main broadcast news bulletins Czech television.
And how did she pass?
When they are on the faculty of journalism to teach about how the media can manipulate reality, to be broadcast today, the Czech television event.
Migrantské crisis was dedicated to about 80% of the news broadcasts.
Except for the first minute, when Thu informed srbsko-maďarské riots on the border and attacks on police officers are euphemistically called migrants, they ran out of patience - they threw rocks and attacked with metal bars), driving the current promigrantská propaganda - The judge names of individual stories.
Criticism of non-governmental organisations - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticise the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - The story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but as a chance.
Wandering refugees - Thu consistently used expressions a runner or a runaway and not a migrant.
What's striking is that the camera uses Thu ilustračních consistently and only footage on small children and women.
But in the same broadcast stated that, of the migrants apprehended in the Czech Republic is 80% men.
Summary: mostly propaganda, which is unprecedented from communist agitek.
I have to say, as a former journalist colleagues to shame.
Ecology in practice.
When I used to be able to place concrete building, I soon ceased to be the sole inhabitant.
The Formica toilet Silverfish moved me.
Roaches domestic, insects with incomplete metamorphosis, i.e., the transition from neprodělávající caterpillars on the beetle and cub looks like an adult, it's just a small and gradually rising.
I was disgusting and I took to them.
First, manually and chemically later.
Socialist drugstore at their disposal to provide a sort of blue crystals.
I think it was called Zyklon-B.
Or something else?
It is, however, successfully destroyed.
Later I handled it with the Pharaohs.
A box with a sort of juvenalizátorem, who brought the ants to the nest, and then he allowed the queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went on, I became the object of my admiration and I am increasingly leaning towards the view that they have the same right to life as we the people.
Plus I took experience of life, that the interference with the ecosystem does not lead to success and a pest can replace the other.
True for fleas and bedbugs would probably worsen ain't karma by killing them.
In a new residence with a partner we agreed that if we're not roaches climb the neck, let them eat in peace crisps renegade skin, some invisible eyelashes and the like.
Their quiet existence over time undermine the spider.
It was the usual kind of pokoutníka, who was on the ceiling.
We should consider that the lives of the occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only added to comfort us.
Because we lived for several years, we discovered that mostly rybenkami and that their number was probably kept on constructing únosném condition.
Confidential regular contact at every need done, we discovered that it is female.
We were witnessing romantic courtship with a partner about one-third less, how careful is fraying threads of spider webs, in order not to get eaten before it reaches the hoped-for copulation.
It took about three days of moving and not to respond to our control.
Under the toilet bowl, where love games played, we're next to the female later found the remains of a male.
Then the spider long weeks, didn't move.
When we thought it had surprised us, the amount of small spiders, hanging around in her neighborhood.
Soon disappeared.
The work they were eaten by the mother, the work of scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
If she went somewhere else or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, popped back up on the ceiling.
True, slightly smaller, probably daughter that praobyvatelky toilet.
From the ceiling while warily watching our behavior and movement under the toilet bowl to evaluate our non-aggression as friendship.
The numbers somewhat seeding rybenek decreased again and spider in his normal activities to ensure the food.
A whole year to our ecosystem.
Our daughter has reached the age when the use of pot was a disgrace.
Yet we tolerate it, but eternal spilling its contents to us.
We exhorted her harder still to use the toilet.
The daughter, however, found an excuse to maintain their habit in the spider, which when wiping very well seen.
We are talking about a spider, happiness in the house didn't have at all.
Crying and screaming to coerce your potty.
There was no avoiding it.
There was a moment when he had to, in the interest of the spider evolutionary shift daughters, command.
It was left up to me.
Was whisked into a glass and banished over the balcony into the garden.
I was saying goodbye to him as a friend, but I felt awful after so long together, as if throwing a relative.
We assumed that the roaches will appear more often and they begin to multiply at a geometric rate.
Wonder of wonders, a week or two, we wasn't there.
I began to speculate on the cause.
I was wondering if there's a spider after model ants somehow grown that the toilet is not so favourable environment for their existence, as we thought.
But then there were the first pieces of medium size, and were again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause their disappearance, and I found that their link with the spider must have been the cause, when you see him, he's hiding in some other place, and that the danger to them from anywhere.
Or maybe they had a telepathic link with a predator and his rapid disappearance triggered an alarm response in them.
The more that their vision no illusions.
Some light shyness showed, but that would respond to hand-waving or quick movements, no.
My daughter goes to the toilet regularly.
I think you forgot the chamber pot.
Only to attract back some spider.
I've got their wishes into the ether and hope for me after the execution, Jeanne.
Otherwise we would have to use the Cyclone b.
The Ten Commandments of Albert Einstein, which enriched the world.
Statements by brilliant scientists of the last century, apparently humanity never cease to fascinate.
He managed to dive so deep that a figment of was always stunning findings.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the greatest scientists of all time.
The awareness of people came for his special and general theory of relativity, which has so far best describes the universe in its gigantic proportions.
Nor can we overlook his clarification fotoefektu kvantování or thought of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the mere hodnoty and system knowledge popular theory of relativity is for many a convoluted enough that, for the intimate acquaintance rather opt for easy comparisons.
It's not easy, however.
Of course it wouldn't be Albert Einstein, even if on this brilliantly found a simplified form of explanation: an hour in the vicinity of your nice seems a minute; a minute in hot oven seems an hour - and that's relativity.
I took the liberty of his entire Pleiades famous quotations to choose these ten, which literally mesmerized me.
Intelligent people are trying to solve problems, genius is trying to do.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
The first one I'm not so sure.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove that I was right.
However, the only time can prove that I was wrong.
But it's a sad time, when it is easier to disintegrate an atom than destroy prejudices.
If the mess on the table reflects the mess in mind, then what reflects an empty desk?
I don't know what we'll be fighting in the third world war, but in the fourth it will be with sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect him.
Few know is dangerous and know many too.
If I had had an hour to tackle the problem, which depends on my life, I spent 40 minutes in his studio, 15 minutes his analysis and 5 minutes his solution.
The hardest thing in the world to understand income tax.
Finally, I cannot forbear to Einstein's formula on the definition of success: taking and for success, the formula a = x + y + z, where x is y and the rest of labour, is to hold your tongue.
The new and modern.
Hospital waiting for changes in Zlín region for $1.5 billion.
"it's an accomplishment, considering that this year all four holds in the black," said Captain Stanislav who was with.
Total profit regional facilities at this moment is about 32 million crowns.
The shares are mostly higher reimbursement from insurance companies, which are as favourable for this year.
This really shows that after poor years, the hospital finally can afford a bigger investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Shepperton to happen thanks to the edifice, which together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
A long period of time, when we were shopping mostly apparatus, ended.
Now we have to build new buildings, because without them we can do, to justify the high-end health plans, the regional deputy for health Petr Nečas.
The changes are in all hospitals.
Clients come to hospitals next year.
Vsetín now choose the supplier of a new internal pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
In Kroměříž have scheduled an addition of dialysis.
Uherske Hradiste wants to open this year, central pavilion build a medical, for around $200 million.
And zlínskou baťovu hospital waiting the long-delayed construction of a new central income and medical ward, which will need to be three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, it is the fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"for the whole region, patients and doctors, it's an extremely important step," she said, for example, to build medical vsetínské Hospital Director Vera prousková.
A five-story building there has to be ready in about two years and offers comfort for medical equipment and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds, and intensive care unit.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which will significantly especially patients, affect all regions.
The new building will replace those in which, for example, many patients lying on the floor in one room, they have only one bathroom, beds are nepolohovatelné, leaking windows and paramedics do not have adequate conditions for work.
"for example, our interna was built 35 years ago, and now it's on the border of their useful life," pointed out while the hospital director Pavel Calábek.
In a few years it will replace the seven-storey modern building connected with urgent income.
Doctors and patients will be in one place all the acute division, especially in new areas.
The same model is already half done Uherske Hradiste.
Central income is already built and in three years will be added to the ward.
"we pay for construction of the loan, and partly from his own resources," explained the director Peter Brewer.
It was this hospital's own funding as the only one in the country can afford.
He still has the highest profit and loss are not even two years ago, when maybe Zlínský hospital dealt with almost dvousetmilionovou loss.
"we have good contracts with insurance companies, an excellent performance, increasing revenues and effectively manage costs in the entire hospital," named vajdák Rudolf, who is in charge of the economy.
The improvement will be even kroměřížské hospital patients.
Within ten to fifteen years will go to repairs, new equipment and reconstruction up to half a billion crowns.
This year will be ready repair station, then begin the rehabilitation of dialysis, or the construction of a new building for an mri.

No one explained to me how I should be adopted to keep refugees in the country, if you don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan CHOVANEC (čssd) after negotiations with their European colleagues complain that the Czech Republic is pushing other States to adopt quotas to redistribute refugees, but refuse any discussion.
He notes, too, that no one has been able to explain how he had assigned to keep refugees in the Czech Republic, when we just don't want to live.
"we didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted to quotas were deleted from the final text," said inmate journalists.
Can you describe more specifically the position which you came at a meeting of Foreign and Interior Ministers of the European Union?
We disagree with the mandatory quotas as a system that simply won't work.
We can't talk about migrants like bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings which have some vision, going somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues, how we're able to migrants on the territory of the Member States to maintain, if redistribuovali.
We can't imagine it.
We didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted to quotas were deleted from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, registrars, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we don't have any problem with that.
We've been talking about this year, and we say that this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Not long ago we talked about forty thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do you keep people on that territory?
Ninety eight per cent of all the people who pass through us, wants to go to Germany.
He didn't want us to almost no one, we simply don't know how to keep them here.
To us they have the ambition to go other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as the destination country, receiving us fireman today, but the interest of the people of this migration waves, from Syria and other countries is approaching close to zero.
You mentioned that we actually don't want the refugees, but fifteen hundred people we've already committed to take.
Would it not be possible to adopt them this way more?
We have pledged to accept 1500 people, but with the condition.
We said: the functional hotspots, border control, military operation.
Even in the 1500's, that's 1100 people settle asylum procedure.
They will come to our detention facility and we treat them as well as to those that we captured.
The big question is, and that we have a debate with Europe if we can detain people, who will be registered in Italy and Greece, possibly in Hungary.
Because Europe to acts so that, in order to register, they can't be detained.
That means, they come to our territory with registration, and if the agreement, which is not yet, it may be that even those 1100 hold on the territory of the Czech Republic, and they're coming in again to leave Germany.
If we can hold off for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will deal with them asylum procedure.
If it's the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 percent, according to European statistics, receive international protection.
Then they get the documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think that these people end up once again in the target countries.
Then there's four hundred people, who will be přesídlovat.
It is the second project, which is still there, and we're making progress only in that debate with churches, the possibility that they could help get them jobs, housing and so on.
But it is a very long haul.
You said that at the meeting of Ministers with us the other States were not willing to discuss.
But it's not so that the Czech Republic just refuses to quotas, but offers no solidarity step, which could unlock the discussion here?
And what exactly is it you think solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany will cast an incentive that all migrants from Syria, they can have access to them, so the news spread in the hours after all camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages the next migration wave, which is going to Germany, because the us just don't want.
We think that the protection of external borders - just you deter waves of migration, to help those in need, and to separate the economic migrants.
Clearly show them that they don't have a chance.
Just last year, came to Germany to fifty thousand Kosovars.
From the safe of Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of the State, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor ’ s office.
If we managed to separate them and accept them or accept only according to the needs of the economies, so would the fifty percent of what social systems in vain for them today, they could go to the refugees.
On the first day, when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic.
Now it's 80, the first day it was twelve.
Where it does occur, to border controls tightened?
We feared capture in the order of hundreds of people.
These are numbers that we got.
We still have a few hundred vacancies in land-based detention facilities.
Of course, all the people that hold them, we'll be back within seven days of Austria.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who these people are, with Hungary's complicated and Greeks - it's completely pointless story.
Where is the tipping point?
It would have to be a grand a day?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days, we will run out of capacity, enough contingency plans will succeed.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister, that would immediately called an emergency government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're several times a day in telephone contact.
If this is the situation, the government can sit down immediately and de facto one would order decided to reinforce the police, army, customs, or prison service.
The extreme option is a state of emergency, which now in some places declared Hungary?
I think it can't happen to us.
Remember that our position is different, we're national State within Europe, Schengen border we have only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldavia, Serbia, Hungary, suggest rather that the Hungarians will try to divert the flow of migration to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route into Austria.
The Czech Republic that would have offended very marginally, at all.
Slavia paid off at the last minute a large part of the debt.
He's trying to avoid bankruptcy.
Football Slavia pay debts.
Their money and their players.
Football Slavia stood in for the first time on Tuesday for insolvency proceedings before the Court.
Almost three months after her for roughly 20 million crowns submitted a proposal for a company online services from Pacific Samoa.
Attorney Susan vamps Mládková tried to judge Michael wenzlovou during several hours to convince, not above slavií bankruptcy.
And I must say, from the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the week before the new owner vamps became a big Chinese industrial and investment group cefc and Czech billionaire Jiri šimáně.
Obviously, since the new owners came in the club money, and at the last moment.
It proves even observations before Tuesday's judicial conduct vamps - vršovický club on Monday, just a day before the hearing in court, sent owed tens of millions of crowns.
"everything was between September 11 and 15 September paid," stated attorney Mládková vamps.
Slavia, who paid for that?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak exreprezentantovi Milano Ivan or Czech záložníkovi Maria ličkovi.
Slavia also paid the fee Agent Alexander losenickemu.
On Friday the club pay the outstanding fees of Prague 10.
Part of insolvency proceedings remain de facto only claims that the Abrahamic vamps.
Under either the club commitments not incurred at all, or lead litigation.
However, we are prepared in the event of losing these disputes the amount to pay.
"we have the necessary funds in a bank account, which can produce a statement of account," she told Judge Advocate Mládková.
"everything is paid in arrears," said Mládková and added that the only are unpaid or disputed liabilities.
Also certain is that, in the next few days the judge decides and the proceedings will continue.
Match gave three weeks ago to send detailed evidence that actually paid the debts.
Subsequently, there will be an evaluation of all the evidence.
The decision can therefore be expected in November, as soon as possible.
The judge ordered the continuation of negotiations on November 3.
The decision, however, she will not fall at this meeting, but after writing to him.

But it would cost about half a billion more, says an expert from the firm, which projected the tunnel.
Blank could imbue even safer, says an expert.
Tunnel complex Blanka was able to build, so there were two busts of soil in the Prague Park, claims the director of production company satra, which is the main tunnel, designer Alexander butovič.
He said that on Wednesday evening, when journalistic search the tunnel.
It would be but according to him, about half a billion kroner more expensive.
Drivers opens on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between cost and security.
"the tunnel could make safer, but the costs are growing exponentially," said butovič.
Conditions in the park have been under him after the same thing all the time, yet the country collapsed just a few steps from the place where he began to make safer and more careful method.
"if that was the measure used about 500 meters before the tunnel would have been about half a billion more expensive," said butovič.
Blanka tunnel during the construction fell three times.

FedEx profits mixed, reduce the fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in full-year profit forecasts because of low demand for freight and higher costs for the inland division.
The company also stated that the holiday is planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers.
In this period last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Shares of the company fell about 2.5 percent in trading předtržním 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx indicates that it expects earnings between $V5 and $V5 for the fiscal year, which ends next May, which represents a decrease of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
Reduced outlook comes despite an increase in interest rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will take effect in January 4, and higher bonuses for ground transport heavy or big packages, which start in November.
The company stated that it still expects profit growth compared with the previous year because of cost reductions, higher revenue, and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "showed a solid performance despite a weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing industry, and global trade."
Holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rivalská ups stated that he plans to hire 90 000 to 95 000 extra workers, which is about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter, which ended in August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is about 6 percent more than last year.
Profit per share amounted to $probable, which is less than the $2.44 per share, which was predicted 12 analysts the Zacks investment research.
Sales increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx was in recent years, hit by the decline in international priority shipping, which caused revenue in its express unit stagnated.
But the boom in online shopping, FedEx results boost ground troops.
In the last quarter of the inland revenue increased by about 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same for more packages and higher prices for their own insurance.
The express unit recorded a higher income due to the higher base rates, while profit decreased in the cargo trade because of higher prices for labour.
Předtržním in trading about an hour before the opening FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
Ended Tuesday with a decrease of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of 11 June.
At its hottest meetings in years, Federal Reserve policymakers this week will spend two days at 27 feet long Honduran mahogany desk and will determine whether, after almost ten years the time has come to increase the key interest rate.
Towering above them at one end of the Central Bank, the two-storey design conference room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The central bank has a dual charge of Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep the price stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be x-faktorem in too close to the predictable decision, which is to be announced on Thursday, about whether the US economy is ready to run in the decommissioning of the unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rate in place since the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows solid growth of the economy, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the fed already cautious about adding to volatility by increasing its benchmark federal funds rate — and that's nothing more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"it is clear that the labour market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"but I think they were just looking for an excuse to not hiking rates, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives sufficient grounds to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed does, which in itself is causing nervousness on the financial markets.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Blomberg had anticipated an increase in rates this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to hold off on the matter, a key indicator of only about 30% chance of an increase.
That would have pointed to a decline in the stock market, in the event that the Fed will raise rates only if politicians softens the slump, promising that further increase is in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599,85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that the Fed will delay rate politicians this week in peace, says John Lonski, the chief economist at Moody's capital markets research group.
"it would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates," It states.
If it's the politicians, the Fed did, "they would have to go to great lengths in the programme Declaration and hold hands in the financial markets, not to panic."
Other experts said that the increase in rates would have calmed financial markets, because it would remove the uncertainty of how the Fed will proceed.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the Fed is on track to increase rates by 0.25 of a percentage point this month, the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions, which would confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that through the spring and early summer is expected to increase rates this year, despite complaints from liberals, there is a need for more economic progress.
Even if job creation slowed in August, the labour market this year recorded solid growth.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
And even if inflation remains below the Central Bank's annual 2% target, the politicians, the Fed maintains that the main reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.
"the economy can cope with higher rates and needs is, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to struggle at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped to a record 16% below its value in May, when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy dragging down global growth.
The market rebounded somewhat in this months ago and only now the Dow loses nearly 10% from the peak in May.
The Fed ’ s policy makers anxious market situation adds a complex calculus, when to start raising interest rates.
"in the absence of that, what happened in the financial markets, and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. oliner, senior researcher, UCLA ziman center for real estate and former Fed official.
Now predicts that at least wait a month, to gain better control over the consequences.
"there's a lot of uncertainty about what impact it will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data on which they could rely on the latest developments in China," oliner said.
The health of the global economy is one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically shouldn't be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed became the monetary authority all over the world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years was enormous.
The mere suggestion of the then chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013, that the Fed could "taper" its monetary expansion on the market, triggered spasms throughout the world.
In a world where markets and economies are still closely linked, it can be expected that Fed officials also are watching developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central bankers and experts, better to be able to read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary karabell, head of Global Strategy for envestnet bohatství-management Company Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "the Fed has a history with exaggerated movements on the financial markets, which seem inconsistent with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, which pushed for the increase in rates, citing the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point during three meetings "despite limited identifiable impact on growth in the U.S.," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials turned these cuts.
The Fed should prioritise financial stability concerns only during the Great Depression, as was the market meltdown of 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee setting rates by the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil to even come close to this level, he said.
"you don't want to be in a situation of fear from the growth rates, because markets are upset," said Posen, president of Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate and mentions financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think he should get to the top.

The Hungarian Government but denies this charge.
The alleged incident happened Saturday night, when AP cameraman Luca Muzi, migrants who were filming across the cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke crossing the border with Serbia.
Against the refugees police stepped in and one of them left a Syrian attack dog with a basket on the nose.
The dog, a man who was shouting "please, please, please, please, I'm a runner," he claims the men.
That man all filming, he noticed one of the officers and wouldn't let him leave.
A journalist then I couldn't even make a phone call to his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The officers were taken to a dark place muziho at registration centres for refugees and asked him to show them what is recorded.
Then ordered him to erase the footage.
The men came as the result of a two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger, because they were dogs.
The AP sent a letter of protest to the spokesman zoltánu Kovács, the Hungarian Government.

Kovács, relying on the police report muziho account of events questioned.

Unpredictable League champions.
A win for city kick us, believes Juventus
"it's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of the city.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic game of the Champions League.
Neither team created a lot of chances, but dumped the ball we had longer.
"the cause of the defeat was not in the tactics Juventus just scored two beautiful goals a game," said Pellegrini, whose team cashed in competitive matches after long 636 minutes.
Last season's runner-up Juventus were mutual encounter exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, as the defending champion only point and with the score 2: 4 is up to 16th place in the table.
That is also why the turnover at Etihad stadium was the big surprise.
"this win will help us mentally, kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Mestre, who had before the New Year to deal with the loss of three pillars - Italy, téveze and Vidal.
In Manchester is blocking pogba, mandžukič and Morata.
"it's so, this victory is very important, perhaps thanks to him we're going on a winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the offensive phase.
This result my players deserve.
"before our balancing goal we could on the contrary cash at 0: 2, but (No hold us up," said coach Mestre buffona goalie.
"we burned several good chances," sorry Yayu tourého, midfield city.
We need to take from Champions League experience next time and try for a better outcome.
Goodbye Angela, goodbye old Germany II.
Before we go on about immigrants, we should remember that all the media frenzy around is managed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
And so let us pause for a moment.
Today news and media are full of babies, which are at the hands of their parents after the dusty roads of the exodus.
And that raises in a man - therefore in European man - automatic guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't come here just desperate children, notice on the shots landing boats to the Greek islands, babies on them so much to see!
Well, the last time us somehow disappeared from the TV pictures of ships heading to lampedusu refugees before the French border near Menton, whose beautiful promenade of thousands of young men.
Largely young black men.
And also vanished pictures from Calais, where these brown and black men are waiting, whether they manage to get through the tunnel under the English Channel.
I guess it doesn't.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian Church Eritreans somehow done per capita of Europe special impression.
Much of it was disproved.
So when it comes to the quota for refugees, somehow, that it's not just the unfortunate children from Syria, but also about the styling - for older: vyfešákované fashionably - young men.
Whose muscles look like they've just climbed out of a gym.
Just one personal experience.
Last summer at a turkish Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on a private beach Hotel.
Regardless, it was a private, arrived to the beach suddenly large group of cars.
But no ham.
And one of them got out young black men.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years ago.
They went to the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes in hand, how differently, smartphones.
It's a private beach, interested and staff - Turks, Muslims! - they are obviously worried.
Occupied all the deckchairs.
Who was on it and was in the sea, he was unlucky.
They were dressed as American rapperského movie.
Wearing a hat with a fingernail, white and colored Adidas shoes on his feet.
Besieged the local beach bar and feasting.
Occupied tables around, stuff sitting next to brown and white guests bar - Read it Muslims and Europeans, without asking.
Mothers with children, fleeing the dining terrace somewhere in peace.
Incoming Indians drinking beer straight from třetinek - how in soap operas from the USA?! - on the beach, they threw empty bottles around.
Constantly shouting loudly at each other.
English, of course, it was.
Then they also drink wine straight from the bottle.
They jumped into a hotel swimming pool in a swimsuit designer, especially those young ladies, in the water screamed and yelled, mothers with children and pensioners ran away and half an hour later, he was on the beach or in a swimming pool or one nečerný guest.
They all disappeared.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff are worried about them and just talk.
A waiter murmured to me tonight he said: "you see that sweetie, what they wore?"
"yeah," I said.
"well, it certainly wouldn't work," said the waiter.
I thought: "I know, I know, they all had a massive gold chains around their necks.
And the one he had on his neck, like a massive cross of gold.
And women were as jewelry store.
"those are drug smugglers?" I asked.
"well, you saw how drinking," the waiter said.
Party drugs, even non-users.
They smuggle you something completely different.
So, it was clear to me what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105 it wasn't so important for me.
I had no idea what would follow.
But the Secret Service and top politicians ought to be the first to know.
I don't know.
To Europe in that time has about 1.5 million immigrants.
And they go and go and go.
Today it turns out that the main problem of the European Union, is that politicians, like totalitně-politicko-korektní intellectuals and embodied them lobbying and economically important groups in Europe have the greatest power.
Germany and its politicians - now publicly accepted the main power in Europe - they lie, lie and lie - but not only them, also the EU ’ s leaders and television, including our own.
For example, the recent television images of excited about welcoming refugees in Germany are at the level of the Moscow TV images from August 1968.
Of course, the station was a few sluníčkářů, but mainly - staroněmečtí - Muslims greeted his fellow countrymen.
The long weeks of blather on the news on Czech Television, how they are according to some research, almost all Germans for the arrival of immigrants.
Of course, who was only a few days in Germany, he knows this is a lie.
Which confirm other information.
For example, the famous poll organized Ard public television companies - English Association of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to Ard wanted a week ago, more than 50% of Germans accept more refugees.
It also meldovaly our TV.
However, from what the other day snapped in Germany: anketním vote in the article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want immigrants - votes were attended by 67 000 persons.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, five years ago, said: "our efforts to ́multi-kulti ́společnost totally failed."
Then she said: "Germany is giving up the fight on a multicultural society."
"all efforts to such coexistence totally failed."
In the country where they live four million Muslims, according to her, the strategy didn't work, that people from different cultural environments to live side by side without Spanish live here with us today, and we've been deluding ourselves for some time, that the possibility that one day disappear.
But that's not reality.
A multicultural approach where we say we just live happily side by side, so this approach has failed.
Completely failed.
But even Merkel probably doesn't have the strength to go against powerful Germany and Europe and especially against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
Conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euroněmec Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, the MP for the SPD in Parliament ’ s, the one who allegedly doesn't even have a high school diploma - yes, that's the one in the EU Parliament, Berlusconi said he could from minutes to play guard in a concentration camp, as he demonstrated again.
It seems, especially under the impression the last statements of German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that except for some, most European politicians, statesmen, these statements does not support countries that were victims of Nazism, are horrified.
What's happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who tried for years, at least outwardly, deal with your terrible past aggressor and killer million?
They are right, who say that, in the spirit of Germany's aggression to be the devil, superiority and violence?
He was right the Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, when all of his strength stopped attempts velkoněmců controlling the middle of Europe?
When he said that the great German idea to destroy Germany?
Probably should.
When it started out, preparing for the first world war.
Thought velkoněmecka, who led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably in a different form.
After attempting to control the state, for example with the rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, in Germany for example, ecology, which by the way, was one of the main forces of Nazism, began to develop the new German ideology.
We'd say well Sunny.
The German elites have long prevented the emergence of German nationalism, and so left alone all these fighters against the atom, enthusiasts looking for Paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi password our forest must live.
To satisfy restless young people everywhere in the world they want to do something different and better, to fully side with the warriors against the warming of the planet, nuclear power plants, etc.
And have forgotten that in this current there is also strongly anti-Semitic - so-called propalestinský - and current antislovanský criminalising all Slavs difficult scum - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after Parents, a Jew, was mainly German Nationalist.
And also, as shown by the latest statements by Schulze and German minstrů openly defying threatening eastern states, the idea of a leader of Germany.
Which must be without obey.
Otherwise woe betide you!
And if we bring that immigrants are very impressionable group of voters, we have what we have.
And it is, as always, capital, especially the German who is comfortable and who benefit from the fact that Germany actually via banks and Union control most of the States of Europe.
Pseudovíra sluníčkářů first introduced the Germans into the swamp and ekologismu multiklturalismu and brought home to them today and maybe even bring millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by the siren voices, soon hit the wall of reality, which Merkel wants to see, and they begin to rebel.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbors by force, can once again part of their population - but still seems a minor part of the mind gets addled - ideologically, but eventually it catches up with the reality, as always.
Germany will burn again?
Muslim quarters already burning.
What does the German Government, to launch public protest of the Germans against incoming Islamists?
Who will come to help Muslims already living in Germany for a long time, but certainly not asimilovaní, to local customs and laws?
What does the German Government, to get into a fight, the incoming Islamo-fascists hyphenated Muslims and Germans fear the Islamisation of their country?
What does that do to the Germans, and even with Germany, when they pick up people who will loudly and publicly to protest against a new Muslim euro-nadčlověku?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict, which triggered in Europe by promoting sluníčkářské ideology, ideology, elitist and essentially totalitarian, and their greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the omission against the dissenting democratic Germans and all menial and riotous Eastern neighbours it can't turn out well.
Completion of tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the pushy salesmen: scare them to death.
Just knock and robust knocker lashes out at you in a way that weaker nature just doesn't stand.
Animated title you off and make even hardened, the journey will take away (or, rather, will) persistent seller and a living sculpture.
A pity, perhaps, that the Speaker could not get a knocker in reality.
And the US could use to ward off a lot of minds and scumbags.
Common růžkatý (OXALIS corniculata).
Small weeds, which tolerates dry environment.
And so is located between the outdoor tiles near my place of residence.
16 September 2015 was photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to the expansionary weeds, but visually creates a good impression, as regards the flowering stage.
Between outdoor tiles is located.
It's unpredictable, it is in our backyard.
She likes drier environment, is easily adaptable, humble and low-maintenance.
Creates leaves with a chaotic composition, but it's worth it to observe and take pictures.
Under the microscope is the only beauty detail - the yellow flowers and green leaves with purple accompaniment.
Brazilian paediatric society Rio Grande, promoting a healthy diet during lactation
Brazilian paediatric sprs company came up with a shocking way to try and convey lessons about the importance of women good diet during lactation using pictures of children from suckling breasts vymalovaného displaying unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is composed of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide infants all the nutrients that they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to an excess of energy requirements is pregnant women and first-time mothers recommended to increase daily caloric intake by 500 calories a day.
However, the new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only diet that mothers should drive.
A recent study by Robert waterlandem, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet of pregnant women in fact influenced the genetic development of their children and protect them before the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, he also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affect a child's immune system.

Bishnu Prasad dhakal, the chief District Officer, states that the more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the police station and some threw rocks and firebombs.
Mr. dhakal argues that the police used tear gas and fired into the air, before resorting to a rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, States.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused by the high number of deaths.
This confrontation was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the ethnic madhesi groups say they have set up a new Province under the proposed new constitution, and ease their political influence.
Demonstrations were also reported in western Nepal ethnic group of tharus, which requires the creation of their own State.
From 10 August was violent clashes killed at least 40 people, including 11 police officers.
When the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which was centrally managed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been going on since 2008, but legislators expedited the process after a devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers this week in Kathmandu to vote for the provisions of the draft Constitution and officials stated that the new Charter should be taken into Sunday.
Certainly, right now we can't panic.
After the loss of the ice master Litvinova you couldn't even domestic duel with hockey players of Sparta (3: 5).
Aren't you concerned about similarly disastrous entry into the big leagues as a year ago?
I hope that nothing like this happened.

For the slightly obese diabetics could be useful in weight-loss surgery
The benefits of weight-loss surgery for obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to tell whether the mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight-loss surgery than those which receive non-surgical treatment.
"mortality data take a long time to display," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study JAMA surgery.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgery to reduce his stomach using different methods.
Reduce hunger and limitations of the human body absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was carried out on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measure the relationship of weight relative to height, is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher suggests overweight person and people with a value of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
For their new study, the researchers used the min-sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from the study from 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and a gastrectomy - in medical treatments type 3 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery, according to the study, fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile remained BMI, who wasn't granted surgical treatment of diabetes, roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with diabetes were resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the treated group was compared to medicine for diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partly in only about 2 percent of patients.
There was also blood pressure control, trigylceridů and "bad" LDL cholesterol demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient hemoglobin a1c levels in the blood, which reflects the continuous blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, noted the researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c value dropped from about 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the group treated with medication, however, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this "better glycaemic control" - reflected in improved levels of hemoglobin A1c -- to reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. chih-cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year with the bypass group lost more weight compared to the group a gastrectomy (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), reached the major downturns BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and had a greater likelihood of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent to 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not improve survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from studies of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona College of medicine-phoenix.
According to the Swedish study were obese people who underwent bariatric surgery, about 29 percent greater chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to the group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival between patients after surgery, according to Blackstone's soothing outcome for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"this work is critical, because it suggests that surgery is safer in a group with lower BMI," without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, States.
Blackstone also maintains that the people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after the decline in patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long with the people we have demonstrated the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think that once the accumulation of these genetic changes, which firmly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is really difficult.
"it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe is not able to accommodate all of the refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama has addressed the question of the ongoing refugee crisis in his acceptance speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama centre for compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, under current circumstances, the interest of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
Also pointed out that the answer from western European countries, whether it was in any way admirable, the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the effort of Germany and Austria in the resolution, stressed that it's only a temporary solution.
"take care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you'll have to think about a long-term solution, a way to bring real peace and real development, in particular through the education of those Muslim countries," he pointed out.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force will never solve these problems, "he added.
In addressing issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also expressed the actions of George Bush after the 9 / 11 terrorist attack, and claim that "violent reaction caused us uncontrollable chain of events.
After 9 / 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem, not the violent path.
I know that his motives were good, but he used his strength to create unexpected consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.
A fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested sanitation reagent for the last 4 years
Poison control centres around the United States reported nearly 400-procentní increase since 2010 in the number of children up to 12 years, which swallowed the highly alcoholic sanitation agent, according to the Poison Center in Georgia.

The YouTube video shows teenage drinking sanitation means for cheap fuss.
The teenagers reportedly sanitation means mixed with Mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be drawn to the attractive scent of appeal.
"kids think that it could hurt them," said Lopez.
Plenty of more attractive (sanitation funds) are those which are parfémovány.
Sanitation resources available are scented with strawberries or grapefruit, oranges, which are very tempting for children.
Sanitation device contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children can mean a few sips of alcohol poisoning.
"this is a highly concentrated alcohol," he told Fox 4 in Kansas City, the medical director of the poison control center at the University of Kansas hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
A glass of whiskey you left lying around, but people these sanitation means they let out, and when they were children, it's a quick way to alcohol consumption.
Nhaijah Russel, a 6-year-old girl, who school recently ingested when four gulps sanitation agents with the scent of strawberries and was taken for treatment at the emergency room.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is double the threshold considered adult drunkenness, according to Dr Chris ritcheyho, emergency doctor who took care of her in the Gwinnett medical center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah slurred words and she wasn't able to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital, for any signs of brain trauma, because a girl for alcohol fell and hit her head, Ritchey points out.
"it was very scary," said Scott, the mother of CNN ortoria nhaijah.
It could be fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or arrange for them to be sanitation means out of the reach of children.
Outside of alcohol poisoning were some sanitation funds associated with death.
In 2013, two women died from Ontario after swallowing the sanitation of the device, which contained toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The medics believed that the product contains methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three students in the fourth grade in northern New York planned to poison their "bad" teachers the stationing of antibacterial products around the room, "according to the police report.
The teacher is extremely allergic to sanitation means and banned their presence in the room.
Police foiled the plan as "innocent chit-chat," and referred to the school district, discipline.

Why was I witnessed executions in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I'll watch the killing men.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't come to that, I'll sit in the viewing gallery in the Oklahoma State Prison death chamber and see Richard glossipa, who will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me if I was one of the four officials, who witnessed his death.
As soon as I received the invitation in January over his best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
The day is coming, I'm starting to get worried.
Why do it then?
I accepted the invitation, because I think that's a good way to be able to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
They offered me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because it is often more applications than positions, morbid lottery that will decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, will monitor the entire execution dispassionately.
I can't do it.
I'll sit side by side with closest friends Richard glossipa and I made him a special bond through months of calls, and one of two and a half hour visit.
I like this guy.
Often, we laugh when we're talking.
Prison service says he cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, I'm compromising his impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he would like that, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "it could formulate better," but still thinks that what I do is wrong.
Richard glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if it did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him that I may at any time remove from the witness list.
But he wants international journalist who will be on site ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help practices against the death penalty.
Kim bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
If you want to know more information about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts, which I created.
I won't be here again all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van treese would make him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that the murder is innocent.
I absolutely believe that it had not provided sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion the execution is bad.
And from this perspective, I'll just follow his death.
I can't say that I'll be really objective.
For this purpose, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is to experience what it's like to see a man I like, to die a meaningless death.
The man escaped from the canning river after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after the free men of the canning River.
Bet the man from petrhu that runs the police, came out after he got into the shallow, muddy water just feet from the officers, who tried to persuade him gently back to shore.
Police from Canning Vale was summoned over the incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them across the river unikem Canning.
But he didn't get far.
"he was standing in the water and said" I'm not going out, just for me, "said Sergeant shandell castledine.
Constable Lachlan perhavec just didn't want to get wet uniform, so tried to use safer tactics and that police negotiations. "
"sometimes people do funny things when trying to escape," said castledine.

Peter Moody says organisers tried to spy on him and at the end of the races
Peter Moody accused organisers of racing Victoria, that he tried to get a spy into the stables last year and threatened to stop racing.
He focused on the organiser and racing Victoria integrity department and based on the belief that they have a personal campaign against him with a late scratch lady tatai during maintenance on race day, which for him Wednesday was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in a difficult situation, as regards lidarin positive swab to cobalt, which he can't explain.
He bit his tongue on charges of espionage for 18 months and didn't want it to look like a "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about the fact that I'm sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it comes from you all at once," said Moody.
They know that it went on.
Sometimes react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
Today, I go home and get a good night's sleep.
I want to go out with his head up and to the owners thought they were doing the best for them.
If they think otherwise, then I shouldn't be the coach.
I would then have to consider what I'm gonna do my licences.
Previously released Moody in his interview for the racing.com bomb that the integrity department tried to spy on him.
"eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dale brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man whom I will call the question - and offered him a job in my stables, that finds out information about things that are in my stables," Moody said on racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's so, they should show all your information, because in an effort to catch me utterly failed.
Robert roulston, former RVL Chairman David Moodie, the current president of RVL, and Bernard saundry, the current CEO of RVL, at that time, were aware, and are aware of it even today.
I should think it becomes personal affairs?
Lets RVL grow some balls and arrange to people outside the coaching position they took responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
I'm all for this industry is bad?
I'm just really, really bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think that it does.
Maybe I need to take my license and push me away and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them stuff to think about.
But I've gotten to the point, if that doesn't matter to me anymore, and I'm really sad.
I'm really sad.
I'll push them and carry the burden on them to make a decision.
I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.
Coach's frustration levels increased with long-term investigation for cobalt including lidari and recent scratches made him feel he could "hours my license on the table."
Mood, most famous for the preparation of the undefeated champion black caviar, marked the rule on race day, treatment for "ridiculous" after he was the horses legs applied a poultice of mud or clay, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
Someone from my team accidentally smeared mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday and it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treatment the tiling in the day of the race, which the organisers have already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who create these rules, doesn't know anything about horses.
"we all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.

Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back rivals for wrestling claim
Melbourne storm coach, Craig Bellamy, criticized his players interventions as "agenda setting" two NRL premiership favourites.
Sydney roosters coach, Trent Robinson, said that the referee allowed players storm "wrestlovat" his players during the controversial victory team storm in the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennett, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, he made a slightly veiled comment on the Strorm after his team won the finals qualification over the North Queensland cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game a "parade" rugby league and according to him, two Queensland weren't "too big" to Wrestlemania.
Bellamy surgeries defended his players and said that the focus on "contact."
Bellamy added that his confidence has increased, because this situation is his team criticized two leading trainers, which may mean that they have the fear of defeat from the team storm.
"it still comes - I don't remember that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling, when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have for the last year changed nothing from our defensive system and techniques, the last weeks we only emphasized during crackdown on contact, and that meant to us.
Trent's here for three years and obviously trains a great team, so it's probably not used to losing, which for him might be a bit of a shock.
It's funny how these things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy to devalue the idea of Bennett's "exciting football" and reminded his mentor, bennetovův st george-illawarra dragons team that won the premiership in 2010, playing "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about the exciting football.
He was right, that was his Saturday game similarly exciting like ours also was as exciting, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George were criticized for the fact that they were boring team and Wayne said that that didn't matter to him.
But now he has a team that can play the style of play, which seems the cancellation, particularly his young quarterbacks with their speed.
That kind of football you want to play, if you have access to this type of players.
This opinion in 2010, and now he wants everyone to teams playing his style of football - but not every team has two reservists like Anthony Milford and Ben hunt, so that's the style they play.
It makes me more confident, because they say those things, because they are worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, the US probably haven't even thought of, when getting to the big matches.
Bellamy also pointed out that in the storm and roosters fell more wickets than in the game, the Broncos and the cowboys.
A game the Broncos team was probably good, I haven't checked, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game over, 20-18 in our game were two more attempts, but it's exciting football?
Or are the breaks and neskórování attempts that interesting?
I think it's agenda.
If you refer to the US, that means that at some stage we'll meet again.
Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland or cronulla cownboys sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park, tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.

Arsenal Captain Mikel arteta says teammates must get behind the injured Jack wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for wilshere, it's still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason for him to play again at Christmas.
This best scenario means that wilshere would miss at least the next four games and, from the point of view of English history, his involvement in next summer's European Championships, is obviously uncertain.
A great pity this nnejnovějšího problem is that wilshere ended last season strong after ankle injury and then back into the former forms during předsezóny.
"this kind of injury threatens career," says Wenger.
It's a wound that needs healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't his ankles or injuries sustained before.
It could be from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger has admitted that there is a relative risk of other injuries, whenever any player returns during the season.
Also there is an unpleasant formula.
Survey conducted by Premier injuries Ltd recorded 23 different injuries wilshera since six years ago had his video game Debut.
During the last five years, he played in only 65 league matches arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a wider perspective for arsenal that means that, in six of eight seasons from 2007-08 was one of two clubs in the Premier League, which lost the most days because of the injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that improvements in recorded injuries during last season will continue.
"sometimes, when you're coming back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and obtain competition," says Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body is stabilizing, I'm sure he does, and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal's campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb games with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger prepares to rotate his team.
Héctor bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, it means that Mathieu debuchy and arteta will probably.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Nacho monreala Olivier giroudem instead of Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and let players who need it, breathe out," says Wenger.
Even if Arsenal is clear favourite to progress from Group F maksimir, Zagreb's reputation as the most intimidating Stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also defeated in a total of 41 games, after their last season campaign "invincible".
The stadium on Wednesday night, the earthquake shook 3.2 degrees Richter.
It was in Zagreb for the tenth time this year.
Wenger thinks that arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League, when capitulated against Monaco and he remains a distant hope, to lead the club to their first victory in the European Cup.
"this deployment is enormous," says Wenger.
Arsenal: it never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
Friendsfest: comedy show, which gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The lack of a similar view in different show is striking, especially given the need for men to open up to more desperate than ever, as far as suicides among young men in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the biggest single cause of death for men aged 20-45 years in Great Britain and is three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address this problem, the campaign against living miserably (calm) year 2015 as the year of a man whose aim is to challenge the culture that prevents men seek help in case of need.
At the heart of this fight is friendship for meeting this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students reporting symptoms of depression found that, in the event that he had damaged a sufficiently high percentage of friends with healthy mood, "their chances of recovery has doubled.
As for those who are not depressed, constitutes the circle mentally healthy friends half a chance on the incidence of mental health problems.
But to make the friendship work, must of course be achievable as soon as possible.
In this communication via social media, with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the Communication, the immediate response is often preferable to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives has doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even if we're in reality rather isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values, our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And how long ago he explained one billionaire and game designer, money really can't buy more happiness.
The beauty of the show friends was for him a source of this idea.
None of the characters weren't defined by their work, but their personalities shone through friendly interactions.
Joey and Chandler's frequent victims, while watching football on comfy chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all stems from the knowledge that, yes, men can also identify with it, although usually they keep your feelings to yourself.
How me one kindly worker explained:... "my role as an audience of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed that even the smallest friendly interactions may make a difference."
The men who contact us, often feel an inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends are one of the shows, which arise in my memory when I'm trying to offer longer-term compensation mechanism.
Highlights the small moments in a man's friendship.
As for my task, outsider status on the line to help people in moments of despair, but long-term aid must come from a close network of friends and family.
Therefore, if you're going on this weekend frendsfest hosted by comedy central station, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where will the interior to celebrate the completely rewritten.
Or when you see someone alone in a Starbucks, just smile and say hello to him.
You never know what difference it can make your friendship.
"friends" will be broadcast on comedy central station from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for # friendsfest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel di Maria celebrates with Charlotte matuidim and edinsonem cavanim run after goal against malmu.
Angel di Maria scored in his debut in the Champions League and so helped PSG on Tuesday beat Swedish team Malmo.
Here's the match report and reaction on the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in the Champions League final comfortable victory 2-0 against malmu at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after their debut in the Champions League and this player sent the French Champions PSG to victory, but after throwing away several chances, until finally upped their lead when Cavani scored his goal in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the team Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, not just focusing on the skills to the elimination rounds, but to improve their road to the quarter-finals, which recorded in each of the previous three years.
But even if you get three points, it wasn't a classic performance team Laurent Blanca Gilden and ibrahimovic was lavish in front of the net and was later replaced by against his home team and the club, in which he started his infamous career in 1999.
"in the Champions League is not easy to win out even at home, so does our opponents problems winning 2-0 and look comfortable in defence is a good start, even if there are things that we need to improve the procedure with the season," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we nevstřelili about one or two wickets more.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of three changes in the team, PSG, who took home this weekend draw 2-2 with Bordeaux in League 1, but he was upstaged by di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was identified as the man who moves the PSG in Europe to a new level after transferring from Manchester United, which took place last month, and he showed why, when he ran on the pass for defense Marc verrattiho Malm and beautiful finish behind Johan wilanda sent the ball into the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone starts it, expecting a big victory, PSG had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in the playoffs and got to this stage, with returned 9 International in the starting lineup and five defenders and two reservists were drawn a formidable opponent.
But in addition to missile Nikola djurdjice, narrowly missed the far corner of the goal in the 34th minute Kevin Trapp, it didn't offer much in attack.
Instead, PSG were themselves about the benefit of attack bad přihrávkami and miserable endings, which wasn't good even from ibrahimovice, who couldn't even shot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed, because his missile arrived at the network shortly after the start of the second half Cavani.
However, pointed much more appropriate, when it came to the preparation of the chances for his teammates, and it was from his pass, when di Maria sent missile drill, which ended in wilandově goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of games thanks cavanimu, this line has already sent the Uruguayan heading for the sixth goal this season after his ibrahimovic pass after pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
That ended any thoughts Malm regarding the possibility that they might struggle to make a profit, and only an excellent save from very near wilanda dashed the hopes of David Luiz and the score remained unchanged even when the goal was střídajícího Ezequiel lavezziho unrecognized at the end of the game.
Malmö coach age hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, nor stated: "our last game in the Champions League took place in December of last year."
Since then, we just played Swedish League, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches is not enough.
Hats off for Paris.
For them it was a fascinating game.

As the refugee crisis ripped through the Schengen area.
Emergency flares detonated Germany nearly nestmelila European crew, but he forced the ship to change course, he wrote the French newspaper Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the problem of refugees: will more likely be systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they step on the old continent - in particular Greece, than to argue for the sake of future distribution of refugees According to quotas on the basis of quantity, which increasingly away from reality.
Six days after the European Commission President Jean-Claude JUNCKER asked 25 of the 28 EU countries, to be reallocated 160 thousand refugees, changed the interior ministers of the Member States ’ priority.
Than worry about the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who are arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already inside the Schengen area.
"the effective management of the external borders of the EU is necessary for managing migration," stressed in text Ministers discussed Monday in Brussels.
After the crisis, the EU is a common currency that is at risk in his next big integration project.
Germany is maybe surprised, but loses his decisiveness and increases the pressure.
Restoring border controls, in particular with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those who seek asylum in this country.
Central power that makes it clear that, without it, there is no free movement in Europe possible.
It would serve as proof that Austria and Slovakia on Monday to this measure.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and even France about also considering, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary to the already long ago.
This exceptional and temporary measures are allowed under Schengen rules.
That's a domino effect, but even a blind man can see.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, Southern Italy and also in Hungary, for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague, Thomas de Maizière about intensely acted during a private conversation with three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is tough.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics were already registered and identified with taking fingerprints two-thirds of newly arrived refugees.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory, because they fear more than the others, so on her shoulders left camps in which the refugees massed on its behalf.
The real black hole remains Greece.
On its islands near the Turkish coast landed this year, more than 200,000 people, which is more than twice recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through the crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge, gaping hole.
Athens, which are still in financial turmoil and they are waiting for a new government, his hands folded in his lap.
That's the starting point for the Balkan route and the source now common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
JUNCKER the Commission promises to introduce control points comes as soon as possible, but did not provide any number or date.
"the challenges faced by Greece, relate to the whole of Europe," agreed on Monday, European Union Interior Ministers on the mobilization on this front.
It is therefore in this country to deploy teams of the European Border Control Agency Frontex.
The EU wants to help Greece to extend its capacity for receiving refugees and to strengthen oversight of the islands.
"it will require adequate financial resources," warns the text submitted to Ministers for approval.
In terms of rights will continue to have the last word in Athens.
The real question of the creation of European border guards were not officially raised, but Europe comes close.
The new emergency situation 'as so pushed the second question binding quotas and 160 thousand refugees, which earlier in the year raised Juncker for the Commission and the European Parliament, and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
It is considered an attack on its sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, Monday was maintained in the text approved mostly '.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only solid promise includes the redistribution of 40 thousand refugees in the next two years, on which agreement has been reached in June during the hectic EU summit concludes, Le Figaro.
