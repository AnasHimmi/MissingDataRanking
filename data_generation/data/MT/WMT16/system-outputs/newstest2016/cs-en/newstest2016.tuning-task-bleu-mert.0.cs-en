When an emergency call, the Professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend
During the call to the emergency hotline to his voice Professor Shannon lamb admitted to police that he shot his girlfriend, and it is necessary to come to their home.
Lamb himself, that his "sweet little dog" was a house alive and probably upset, and that contacts on the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on the White Paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back, I love Amy and she is the only one that ever loved me," said the letter signed by Lamb, who, according to authorities.
There was no suspicion that the lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would he go 300 miles on a school campus, where police believe he shot favorite professor Ethan Schmidt in the door of his office.
The police chief in the Delta State University, Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
Lamb said the fateful phone call to an emergency line shortly after.
Then came another death; lamb took his own life when police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school to students and faculty, to hide behind a locked door, the responsible authority is still trying to figure out what was the lamb's motivation.
The details, released by investigators on the side of the State and the students and staff who knew him, and together they created the image of a talented, but troubled, probably a teacher.
Students have confirmed that his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt himself included lamb in the book, which he wrote, in a thank-you "great people" with whom he shared an academic life.
They both taught at the School of Social Sciences and history, together with the other 17 members of the faculty, students, and many were on courses for both at the same time.
At the same time, inclination have occurred regarding the problems.
The student, who extolled the lamb, Brandon beavers, said he also appeared agitated and shaky, "like with him, something wasn't right."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that it was confronted with stress at the end of the academic year, the HWC 2014-15.
Lamb has previously asked for Delta state university for some time off for health reasons, when it stated that he has a problem.
And this year, he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes regarding the recruitment of the universities meant that a Phd on which lamb worked hard, he would be guaranteed automatic term in order to become an assistant professor.
University President William La Forge stated that he didn't know about any conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but that, "Mr. lamb obviously worried about something."
On these issues we have lamb.
After he left the campus, the police picked up his trail, he crossed the border of the State of Arkansas back into misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, the lamb was killed from a gun in the yard jedinýmvýstřelem house about a mile from his parents on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington State confirmed the coroner, methel Johnson.
A car left running outside on the street.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went into this house, although Johnson said that he probably knew the people who lived there.
Lamb in this country grew up.
Lamb started work at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009, and taught geography and hours of training.
In the spring, he got a doctorate in education.
One of the longtime friends lamb described him as a bright, charismatic and funny man.
Carl Hairston indicated that she was 15 and lamb, 20, when they met through mutual friends.
She was with friends at the high school, and he was the older guy who tutored her for a few years playing guitar.
It was a heartbreaker.
The heart of all of the girls softened, as soon as he appeared, "said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in a suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss together allegedly used for some time.
During the emergency call, Lamb said: "I've killed my wife," but the marriage never existed.
Had a dog named lightning, who lived with them in a brick house, which is adjacent to the cutoff Gautier.
The police said that the dog was fine.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O ’ Steen, said that he broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends and they had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"she was completely collapsed," he told O ’ Steen about his daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
O ’ Steen, said that with the lamb, but through his daughter Abigail to know that lamb was interested in music and playing the blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss, along with Abigail vystuopovali at Summer Festival three years ago.
Later played together random gigy.
O ’ Steen, said that his daughter, she writes and sings her own music.
Prentice was a nurse, who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender, and occasional entertainment coordinator in the julep room, a dimly lighted bar near Gautier, he said that the last time he saw lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, sweat, what lamb played guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"it was just a happy couple," he said.
We fooled around on each other, and they were a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, killed a professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in Native American and a colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the student body of the boys' club and the student government.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, with about 900 people, including members of the faculty, staff, students and members of the Community, took part in the consultation events with candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff vigílie Schnidt also attended, during which the University choir sang "bright morning star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, the school started again.
"we're trying to get our students back," says La Forge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Feet for the Associated Press, Emily wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story has been amended to reflect the fact that the police are now saying that the lamb made a phone call to an emergency line after killing Schmidt, and although Lamb called Prentiss, his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.

8 election numbers, which show that Donald Trump in real light
Some tried to label him as a person, which often change their minds.
The others walked away as a joke.
And some are preparing for the implosion.
But some Republicans Donald Trump trying to pull down from the top of the polls, they're not (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead for a two-digit number, and some people are really starting to ask, what does it mean for the nomination chances of this real estate tycoon.
Of course, it is still only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of the year 2011 Rick Perry's leadership has made its way to the rise of Herman Cain, in the end, neither one of them didn't win a single position in the nominating process.
There are many reasons why it could face in the general election.
But the outside groups like super PACs Jeb Bush and economic conservative group club for growth are aware trumpovu will endure and began unloading their dollars on the table in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent poll numbers, which suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
The evaluation trumpovo turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, monmouth university poll showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnate.
In the middle of July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
He now has six of the 10 Republicans to take a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are in the early stages.
The quinnipiac university poll, conducted last week, found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Donald Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN / ORC poll, which was conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" with Donald Trump as a candidate.
Only two of the 10 reported that they were "outraged" of his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as a trump (43 per cent of people said they were "thrilled" against 40 percent who say the same of Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if Jeb Bush the favorite to become the nominee.
Most Republicans see Trump as a temper problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of republican primary voters nationwide is receptive to the idea that the real estate magnate has the right temperament for the presidency, according to Monday's vote, ABC News / Washington Post.
The same number are holding senatorial club in the State of Iowa, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality of a leader, according to quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he has the personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 in 10 independents, saying that his temperament is not one to the White House, according to ABC / post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When he puts on his učenecké hats, Republican voters think Trump is the real candidate.
On the question of who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was the best choice, according to the CNN / ORC poll from last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: the GOP voters had in the past, the brightest crystal ball.
This time, in the last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans selected as the winner of a Rick Perry candidacy against 28 percent for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.
Yet, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump as a credible campaign.
Even if Republicans had gathered around a different candidate, Trump still beats almost everybody.
Some scholars point out that a fragmented field is likely to contribute to trump's lead, while possessing anti-trumpovská aid is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But the Monmouth University survey at the beginning of September, shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always be a majority support.
Lead over Carly fiorinou 13 points, Marco Rubio's 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, John kasichem 33 points in each.
It is in a race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead over a wide 19 points in a hypothetical match one against one.
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters claim that he had already made his point of view.
A new CBS / nyt survey on Tuesday shows that just more than half of the voters supporting trump maintains that she will not change her mind.
It is obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that he never changed his mind.
46% of the States that keep options open for change among the candidates.
Yet Trump's current strongest opponent his outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who think their minds in the final, if they were twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans allegedly agrees with Trump on immigration issues.
Even from the moment when Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech, immigration still holds as the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that the bombast of Trump's key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and a damage to the effort of a re-branding.
But in Monday's new ABC / Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will also stay.
Frustration with the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are today roughly half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their underdog status.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new Monday night vote ABC / Post claims that they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry at Washington.
Vote Des Moines Register / Bloomberg Iowa a few weeks ago, revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated Republicans in Congress, 54 percent is "unhappy" and 21 percent "angry as hell."
The House of Representatives supported a greater share of State charges for coal.
The Czech Republic receives more than $400 million.
The Chamber of Deputies in a first reading The government supported Amendments to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of revenue from the mining of the brown coal from mining companies.
The Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised members that, thanks to the extra money as the Treasury, municipal budgets.
The draft was criticized by members of the opposition, who fear that the mining companies won't want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they pay higher fees directly to the state government supported rozpočtu.sněmovna at first reading amendments to the Mining Act, which among other things means that the State should receive a bigger share of revenue from fees from open-cast mining of brown coal from mining companies.
The State ’ s share will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will be reduced from the current 75 per cent to 33 per cent.
The draft also change the method of calculating reimbursement for the minerals that the firm mined.
The change in fees for the extraction of minerals is to bring to the Treasury about 427 million more than in 2013.
On revenue budgets of the view of the government is to have a neutral impact, because the fee is to be higher.
In the year of the fee received from roughly 450 million kroner and the State budget of 150 million kroner.
From brown coal mining was about $200 million for municipalities and State 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in payments from the mining space to the mining for 1,000 kronor per hectare per year.
The revenue from these charges is still in its entirety belong to municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD), told members that the municipalities that gain a year instead of the 14 million to 100 million kroner.
The amount of mining fees won't be determined by law, but by the government.
The payment will be calculated by multiplying the number of newly harvested the mineral and rates for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, is the reason for the amendment, among other things, the possibility of flexible reactions to the current economic situation.
Member of the ODS Marek Benda, but warned that the fee by the government doesn't have to be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to the Minister, a doctor in this case, however, it's not a tax, because it is levied on mineral, which is state property.
The fees are only municipalities, whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining will get three quarters of the money municipalities and a quarter of the State.
The same ratio will be even in the case of mining radioactive rocks.
Part of the money, which the State mining royalties will be ring-fenced.
For example, 28 percent will have to go on damage control, after logging, mining or to ensure the emergency services.
The draft was criticized by members of the opposition, who argued, in particular, that the municipalities affected by the mining and the region.
For example, a (TOP 09 and the mayors), warned that mining companies no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they pay higher fees directly into the State budget.
"it is not possible to tunnel in one of the poorest regions, only the Minister of Finance to improve budget," said David Kádner (dawn) elected in Ústí.
Prior to the increase in unemployment, pro Party MP warned Hannah aulická.
Kádner and aulická unsuccessfully proposed amendments to be rejected, he wanted to go back to the government the Škoda completion.
The report says that, according to the mining companies to increase fees reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent of the contracted in the long term.
The main consumers such as power plants or CHP should therefore not price growth.
"on the other hand, however, this really increases the risk that mining companies will be compensated for the increase of efforts to reduce its operating expenses, which primarily means reducing the number of employees," says the government.
It is, however, an increase in fees from the point of view of employment.
According to the rapporteur, to the novel by Milan Urbana (ČSSD) is the key to members before the approval of the law knew the conclusions on the updated Energy Master Plan and the Government's decision about the limits on coal mining.
If coal will also benefit the limits, then it will have implications for the proceeds for the State and municipalities, he pointed out.
Urban disagrees with Mládek, in that the decision of the breaking down of the Czechoslovak army should fall until after 2020.
Limits on the CSA down, he says, should break it for social reasons, and because of the long term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Jolly will lead the Czechs as the number one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear in the Davis Cup draw Thursday baráže in India on the board and this time, every one of them would probably even in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil is planning that, due to the difficult conditions to spread the load across the quartet.
In Delhi, there is heat and high humidity, that's why they expect challenging matches, which could stretch to five sets.
We need to take that into account.
I'd like it spread by the weather.
And, depending on how it will look in practice today, he said, from a Czech collection in downtown kumára gladyou khánny.
With the number one team in the world and in his late thirties, George is happy to both Friday and Sunday's singles.
The two are likely to roll over to Luke jelly and Radek Štěpánek.
I'd like to get involved, almost all of them.
I got it in my head, slowly, but in the meantime, I won't say it, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech lineup should be štěpánkova participation in the doubles on Saturday.
It's just a question of who will be next to experienced deblisty, who is in doubles in the Davis Cup record 18: 4.
It probably won't be happy.
There are options with jelly, or Adam pavláskem.

Decide according to the evolution of the singles.
Option may be Pavlásek, with a surprise in the first round of the doubles, winning over Australians.
"it's nice to play some doubles," he said.
Against Australia, I did it right, and if I'm playing, I'd like to show the same performance, I've been there since the second set.
"I'm glad for the experience and I would like to bring," said Pavlásek.
Domestic singles to Yuki bhambriho (125th in the ATP rankings), who won a challenger last week in Shanghai, where he beat players ranked third and fourth hundreds.
Two will be somdev devvarman (164).
They are both players of challengerů and our experience of the ATP Tour, but a lot of times, we believe that the top of the charts in the Davis Cup, don't decide.
"the present form, the weather," he said.
Friday's opening singles start at 6: 30 CET, and can stretch out because of the weather.

Jeremy Corbyn will debut at Prime Minister's questions
Since his election is the debut of Mr. corbyna in pmq very eagerly awaited
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will have its debut in Prime Minister's questions later, and for the first time will have to work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will take the first of his six allocated questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be closely studied by the media and members.
In a weekly statement asked for "less drama and more facts."
He also said that he might skip a few sessions, which would have left his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of the leadership of Mr. corbyho, coming after his appointment to the Shadow Cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the TUC's Annual Congress.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour leader standing in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was met with criticism from a number of conservative members and is the centre of attention a couple of stories on the front page of the newspapers.
The decision of Mr corbyna no singing the national anthem has attracted attention for yourself
A spokesman for Mr. corbyna said he would be "stood in respectful silence" and recognise "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of the Shadow Cabinet, Mr corbyna, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that labouristickému leaders recommended that the national anthem to sing "notwithstanding" his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in a top team of Mr corbyna, citing differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party had initially supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work also "add" following the appointment of Mr corbyna over his position in the European Union and the Government's benefits cap.
Mr. corbyl said at the TUC conference that workers' Party putting forward amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the limit.
A few hours later, said Mr. Smith, the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, that the party is "very clearly" said government plans to reduce the cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn is the fifth leader of the Labour party, he faced David Cameron in the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the labor party, who promised a different approach to politics, says that he has ideas "from the crowd," the questions for Mr Cameron and received more than 30 000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that pmq is too confrontational and refrain from how "ready answers," sprocket, trade, and instead, he promises to focus on the important issues, such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn argues that Angela Eagle, the shadow Business Secretary, will represent him at pmq, when not to — like, for example, when Mr. Cameron goes to a foreign country.
Also dropped from the thoughts that he would let the other colleagues, from time to time, for him to come out, because of that, the whole matter discussed with Speaker of the house John bercowem.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said that he wants to divert from the Punch and Judy style of politics "," which was often associated with pmq, but a few years later, he admitted that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990 were seen pmq as a key barometer of opinion leaders, their leadership of the house and their position among the other MP, although critics argued that became a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.

Opponents of the chappaquiddick Prague apartment building.

The magistrate in the Decision noted that there has been a breach of the law has not been complied with, because all the territorial decision.
"some of the formalities of the territorial decision does not, for example, the kind of land, the distances from neighbouring buildings, sufficiently clear and described the shape of the building, the definition of the territory of the influence of the construction," he writes in his decision.
The magistrate considers illegal, too, that some of the supporting documentation for the decision they were issued initially to present the documentation, but that has changed.
For example, the opinion of the environment.
Part of the building has to be on the grounds of the National Gallery, an investor, but its not a valid consent.

Metcash's campaign in the country, to fight invasion, Aldi
Metcash's IgA stores try to protect from the onslaught of Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Metcash's campaign in the country, to fight invasion, Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers, and the first of the more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, metcash and IgA supermarkets to strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build through the Iga brand marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IgA retailers and suppliers to add brands such as an ice cream maker based in dunsborough Simmo's tastings in Iga stores and the store owners are selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League, local customers.
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defence strategy of 29 September, when sales of food, alcohol, hardware and celebrates its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake here, because the south and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of the Iga metcash business steps and generate a higher turnover than the metcash network IgA in the eastern states.
Customers in the south and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IgA stores are enjoying a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - in SA, more than 30 per cent and 24 per cent in wa, compared with around 14 per cent in the eastern states.
Anyway, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believes that Aldi have the snares 5 per cent of the food market in those two States during the 12 months since the opening of the first store, which took sales from existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
This week, in its report, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom kierath, estimated that the retailer IgA could lose $360 million in annual sales and metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West during the next year, it will generate sales of $500 and $600 million on the individual markets.
Loss of sales of the volumes of food and the fixed price basis metcash would have cost around $13 million in pre-tax income, said Mr kierath.
At the same time, metcash's share of the markets in the eastern states, especially to Aldi and Coles, although the latest roy Morgan research found that shopping in Iga were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that metcash food sales fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, with 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and its market share reduced from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by the year 2020.
Last week, a leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could be "highly likely to disappear within decades.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to the Douglass comment.
But it is known that a member of the Board of Directors of metcash contacted Douglass last week.
IgA's market share dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and earnings from the food trade, metcash, which supplies IgA, about 1,200 retailers fell by 43 percent from 2012, which reflects the operational development, change, because sales and profits are under pressure.
However, wholesale counterattacked and invest more than $150 million a year to supplement the regular prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and helping IgA retailers to recapture the business by adding a fast growing food and news from investors.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice, claims that the programmes get increasingly prices and retrofitting business momentum and hopes to come back to the basic velkoprodej profitable growth in profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by the President of tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit for his behavior, rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became collateral damage during the recent fuss around his friend Nick kyrgiose and he deserves praise for his behavior, rather than criticism, the President of tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a junior member of the talented duo, often referred to as a "special KS," drew unwanted attention thanks to her affair with the infamous kyrgiosem and wawrinkou tent at the Montreal masters.
Soon after, in the torrid qualification match in Cincinnati, had to be his opponent, Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison two separate arbitration, Harrison said afterwards: "wawrinka had one stretch kyrgiosovi and I should reach out to him, too."
While he was last seen smashing a racket after he thwarted a possible defeat Richard gasqueta at the US Open, kokkinakise staunchly defended the Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where they compete with Sam Groth in the other singles to Bernard romicem in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"pretty intense, I was thinking about that in my opinion the thanasi was a little off," says Healy.
He destroyed his racket when he lost because of the paralysis in the US, but it's not the first player to have because of the frustration of himself took his anger out on his racquet. Thanasiho I know pretty well, and I can say that this incident will not be proud of.
But I really was very, very good, because he was in the United States is exposed to very provocative circumstances for Harrison and so on, so, in my opinion, deserves great credit.
He's got a great team around him, he also has a great family around me, and I think that his treatment was a bit hard.
It's a very mature 19 year-old man, he works very hard, and the team is great and so on, never had a problem with the other players in the dressing room he's very respected, he trains hard, he's in great shape, it's a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on their own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook kyrgiose for an important match, which starts on Friday, and states that the "mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports a native of Canberra to return to the team as a long-term star.
"first of all, we want to make our team is completely focused on the game and not at all the controversy around him [kyrgios] was formed," says Healy.
And I think that Nick rose very quickly, how Federer, Murray and others point out, in the eyes of the public, is growing fast, have also made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight, when he would think about that, in my opinion, is the best solution for the team and for himself.
The European Migration Crisis: Hungary Declares State of emergency, closes borders and holding migrants
After the state of emergency on Tuesday, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia and held off those who tried to have her illegal crossing to stop the tide of migrants.
On the border chaos, as hundreds of migrants piling up in no man's land, and the Serbian authorities have responded indignantly.
Those who are stuck at an unknown time on the strip of land between two States, those who are fleeing the violence in their native countries, tents and settling in.
But the feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter overhead, migrants call "open borders together!" and cursing the Hungarian unit of riot police.
Some at the protest, refusing food and water.
The Serbian foreign minister, declared that it was "unacceptable" to the refugees were sent back from Hungary, while there are still more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, and not just the indirect harm.
During the next days will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest maďarsko-srbské border came a day after a block of 28 states to come up with a coherent immigration policy on the ongoing meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to sharing responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in a surprised Italy and Greece and talked with the hope of achieving the eventual agreement next month or at the end of the year, which EU nations have accepted more than 120 000 other refugees, including Hungary.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Austria on Tuesday convened a special European Union summit next week to discuss the refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, their hopes on the Junior ROTC Brussels or his neighbors.
On Tuesday, a state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the road and speed up court cases discussing asylum.
In the meantime, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a fence of barbed wire along the border with Romania, to stop the refugees, who are seeking to transition through their country, if it's now completed a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News korepondent Charlie d'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped put barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary became the main weakness, and the entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom fled from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
The Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, insisted, however, that most of them are economic migrants, looking for a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, which is a view that is clearly different from that of the other EU States, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalised breaches of 4 a three-foot fence, which the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for a longer period in jail for those refugees illegal transfers.
"because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declared a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we are quite clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, the Parliament must still approve the deployment of the army, which is expected in the next week, but the associated press journalists on the border watching the heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for a few days.
Gyorgy bakondi, adviser to Orban for home defense, he said that the Authority was caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and captured 15 already on the territory of the State.
With the damage to the fence, and are now in police custody, accused of committing offences under the new laws.
Authorities quickly left to fix the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after they used a tractor truck covered with barbed wire.
At the main border crossing at roszke was a mess, because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and the throng of people.
About 20 of them to fit in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, when they refused food and water until they're allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton ahead of Bernie Sanders has been reduced by half in the national vote
The former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders gaining on her.
Clinton now supports the 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether she will run for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the competition, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are right, the decision of which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more certain of their choice than those who support other candidates.
From a CBS News poll from last month, Clinton has lost ground on several demographic groups, while Sanders has a few.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and improving, but its lead is narrowing.
Her support among men has reduced dramatically, and Sanders on her losing only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under 50 years evaporated, and now they are equal to Sanders.
Clinton has a large lead thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in double digits ahead of Sanders among liberals, but now it is losing to Sanders in this group, only 5 points.
About half of Democratic primary voters in the United States say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 per cent would support it only for that, that's a candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
I guess it's no surprise that they are the current přivrženci Clinton because of her particular passion.
Views are mixed among those who currently support Clinton, only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same thing about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Hillary Clinton ’ s supporters are asked in an open question, why do they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that he has the right experience (16 percent), followed by, that is, it's time for a woman president (13 percent), and that is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Supporters of Clinton also mentioned her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It also cited a big choice election and consensus on the issues.
While the Vice President is considering a potential candidacy for President, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would wish to face - a third thinks that she would not run for president.
When Democratic primary voters were asked whom they would have chosen as the second choice for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters claimed more than half of the Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton will spread out of 20 points, if Biden would run, on 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning in the general election; but this number dropped from 78 percent from last month.
Biden is on a scale far in the second, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely zvolitelného, is increasing.
However, when it came to the question of greater importance, the Democratic candidate, voters prefer solutions to problems before a greater chance of being elected.
As of last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, they have good results in certain key characteristics among primary voters of his party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and he thinks they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden from all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same of Sanders (15 percent), but the 27 per cent it doesn't have this view.
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
For all of these standards, about a quarter of democratic voters to Sanders has no opinion.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email account and server as Secretary of State continues, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of this matter, and they say that their overall view of the affect her at all.
But among the American public, it's a whole different story.
Half of Americans are dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third of it's content.
The public's views on this topic were split in March, shortly after this problem came to light.
A majority of Americans say that the email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, compared with 36 percent of their thoughts on Clinton.
It's all about the Republicans, where more than 6 in 10 say their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Still, Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy among voters her party, this question is still a problem among registered voters overall: just 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, which is down eight points from last month, and about 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters think he's honest and trustworthy.
And at the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested in honesty best led Biden, Carson and bush.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters just didn't do it.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson over Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest survey, the CBS News / New York Times
The two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest survey and others for their support.
Voters from the ranks of Republicans across the country continue to support Trump with an overwhelming majority, and climbed up from the 23% support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the debate, fox news last month, 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired in the same period from 6 to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson doing well across demographic groups, and excludes trump between univerzitně educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and John Kasich, the governor of the state of Ohio is behind obeying Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker with a gallery of the 10% support fell to 2% currently.

"we need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of baruch college freshman student
Almost two years after a student died during přetěžovacího fraternal rituals in the pocono mountains in Pennsylvania, was filed murder charges against five men.
Members of the brotherhood of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
The police stated that he was blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand, a total weight of 30 pounds, and he was repeatedly harassed, when trying to get to the target over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity didn't call 911 immediately after Deng allegedly passed out, and waited for an hour before he was taken to the hospital, the police said.
However, they have found the time to change clothes, Deng, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the National President of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, said police chief Chris - at a press conference.
"at this point, members began to hide equipment, and basically they prefer the prosperity of the Brotherhood before life Michael Deng," stated chief Wagner.
Unable to revive him and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck by blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"too many families were zdevastováno due to overloading in bratrstvích and at least one student is dying every year because of hazing since 1970," says Douglas fierberg, an attorney representing the family of dengue, in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must be responsible, and this step is an important part of the authorities.
Monroe County grand jury has recommended charges of murder in the third degree for the first of five members.
Thirty two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault, conspiracy and coming back.
"we want to hold not only the parties involved, but in the event that there is an organisation, which approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will drive them to responsibility," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and national fraternity revoked its relationship with local branches.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
Growth rates will come and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy slides into recession.
This is all we know.
What we don't know is how much time it would take and how long it will take.
For the economy, in particular, offers a little history on the timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, though not always, in determining how the economy and financial assets to respond.
This is the reason why the U.S. Central bank officials have stressed that investors would not be focused on when it will start raising rates, but rather the trajectory, how long will it take to standardisation.
The game is actually more variables.
In the end, however, may be members of the market to make sure that all the fuss because of an increase in speed may be exaggerated.
"the Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as' the end of an era of cheap money, '" he said in a note to clients, Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we don't anticipate that a gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low, creates a seismic shock, which many fear might be.
It means that there will be adverse effects.
Here's a look at how they react to certain areas of the economy, on the basis of historical trends:
Given what the market has in the last month of the CCA, can be expected to increase rates to make the air a little bit unstable.
But as soon as there is increasing, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"it seems that there is a trend for the suspension of the shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which perhaps reflects the time lag in monetary policy," said analysts at Deutsche Bank in a recent study, about what will happen after the Fed ’ s increase.
In fact, the market for the last 35 years most often - about 14 per cent - Heading to increase rates in relatively flat in 250 days (the average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returned to normal after a period of five days, with the average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis of the bob dolla, chief equity strategist of Nuveen asset management, published in Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the stock tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rate increases and the return of beginning to decline.
The recession is a fact of economic life, but the increase in rates often help her.
Currently, the Fed is facing some of the conditions that still exist, and which could hasten a recession.
The most remarkable is that the gross domestic product, close to its lowest point in the history of the Fed ’ s interest rate increase.
According to the Deutsche Bank was in 118 rate hikes since 1950 only twice a year on year increase in nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few expect him to maintain, when, in the third quarter was only 1.5 percent, the Atlanta fed.
Raising rates in this difficult economic background could be risky and could affect the question of "whether this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market participants were ready for the Fed ’ s growth all year and all eyes turned to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which was held this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that, at this meeting, the FOMC would have to approve the increase, future trading indicates only 25procentní probability.
"in our study since 1950 were all zvyšovací cycles so far in the great cycle of increasing leverage with the GDP of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning of the recovery," it says in the report.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sample period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of these, when the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we're on 74 months and still continue.
Fixed income was also volatile, because the market is expecting an increase in rates, and the model is somewhat similar to what they're experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more pronounced in bonds than shares, when the Fed will change the direction of policy.
For bonds, it appears that the proceeds are changing direction immediately after the arrival of the first cycle of increase / decrease.
At the end of a cycle of increasing bond yields are falling right now, "said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that the increase in rates will cause approach yields between long- and krátce-datovanými bonds, which matched the curve.
High-yield bonds often in this climate, they work better, though, "we're still cautious about the tension of the revenue," stated in its analysis, Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab.
What's interesting is that Jones thinks that the markets are no longer adapted to the expectations of the Fed ’ s policy.
"in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are few signs that the market is the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightens policy.
In general, firms that carry out most of their business in the US, win for an increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will be worse, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market and their debt will also be larger.
"history shows that" quality "shares tend to overcome during the three months after the initial rate increase," said analysts at Goldman sachsve in a report to clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets ahead of the company ’ s weak balance sheet in any increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004, an average of about 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also have their counterparts in the lower quality, on average, about 4 percentage points) or 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of variable interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Out of pure equity plays benefit consumers, too, thanks to a rising dollar.
Savers may also see their profits through higher revenues, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for the "fertilizer"
Takes the view that it's increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rivals
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says he's just cheating the British
A parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the voice and says he's not an original idea
BBC Radio 3, the "changes" in the classic FM, claims a leading parliamentarian and piling fresh pressure on the broadcasters to show that they're doing something that commercial broadcasters don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said BBC bosses, the public service radio station that seems to be "ohlupována" and is increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rivals.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word" ohlupováno "- but it seems to be turning into classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December of last year.
The BBC music awards, which began in the last year, seems to be the British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to mind, when in fact it only simulating what we already have on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
The Director General of the BBC, denied the charges on the grounds that the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival, in terms of live music and public education.
That's what I've learned about classical music on Radio 3 would be to any other radio station.
And their commitment to live music and making music is, in fact, at the top level.
"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and marketing to new works into the operation, it is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, argued the BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey, it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than ever before, because the British are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was the only element of the output of the BBC, which came under fire for stepping on the foot of commercial competitors during the broadcast of the Culture, Media and Sport, and they got to the hearing.
The Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked the voice - the music talent show which the BBC bought from a Dutch producer Talpa media for an estimated price of £22 million.
You can see why this programme is discussed as non-original and not especially different?
Lord hall insisted that BBC One show - in which the September stars Paloma faith aboy George as judges - was made "in a manner typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the corporation to "find a hit of his own" when will be next time launch a fun series.
However, refused to rule out ordering more future seasons of the show the voice or spending taxpayers ’ money in royalties to other entertainment formats.

It meant that people were able to shop online, and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the couch.

For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, it is more than a third of sales conducted through the Web business.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in Stone fashion stores.

The vast majority of the barbecue, and then a few times a year.
To make the barbecue was successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - the ideal is to adapt the marinating meat, a few hours before the heat treatment.
That oil is the best and at the same time, the barbeque leaves health beneficial substances?
In general, the actual process of barbecue should conserve fat.
Experts agree that a large part of the oils at high temperatures begin to lose its flavour.

Grape seed oil for the barbecue, health and beauty.
When you say meat, experts from the firm of Bohemia oil from the kraslic Sokolovsku comes immediately to mind grape seed oil.
Indeed, beautifully complements the taste of the fish.
In the kitchen is characterised by a unique characteristics increasing the natural taste of food.

Not only is suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, the seasoning salads, but also for heating food.
At the barbecue can be used in two ways, when marinating and grilling.
Marinating meat and fish keep their juiciness.
In the preparation of the marinade must be present three ingredients: oil, acidity and spice.
The acidity of the cider vinegar and deliver, for example, to soften the meat.
Again, spice adds flavor the meat and oil, preserves and delivers the right edge, says Daniel wolf.
At the same time, it adds that grape seed oil, for marinating is ideal, because as one of the few oils can penetrate through the dark meat.
Marinated meat or fish is ready for grilling on how to move forward?
Extra virgin olive oils are characterised by the fact that in the preparation of foods are just a few drops.

In a salad bowl, then add to the mixture of salad leaves, sliced cucumbers and arugula pulled on the great blocks sliced peaches.
According to the taste of salt and pepper on me, you can also sprinkle with minced chili and soy sauce.
At the conclusion of a few drops of pokapejte of grapeseed oil.
For exceptional taste then you can gently sprinkle the salad with sliced almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it's not just the drugs but also on the will of the patient to fight.
Ms is a complex disease and the person with the diagnosis of needs care of a number of experts: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, therapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist and many other specialists.
Of course, it's not just about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultation, if they decide to have a child, to care for these sick include social advice, recommendations on housing arrangements, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient.
The more actively to fight the disease, the longer it can work and does not fundamentally change the style of his life.
Indeed, as doctors point out, the passivity of patients for the activity of the disease.
It is, for example, demonstrated that exercise significantly delaying the time when sick needs some compensatory aid such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their families subjected to various myths, such as that the disease is automatically leads to end up in a wheelchair.
And that's why the page get a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign, give yourself a chance.
The most important person in the care of the patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis pays twice saying that the disease starts to heal sooner, the doctor may have more influence.
It's because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when it is not yet a process neuro-degeneration, so strong.
The earlier we intervene, the greater the hope is that we can stop the illness and delay the debilitating, explains Dr. Eva honey from the neurological clinic of the general University Hospital in Prague.
It's very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitative care, which most often addresses the weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
With the sick to work according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthening the pelvic floor, mitigate swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.
"it's very individual, depending on the specific problems of the patient," says Dr. Martin kövári, the chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis may indeed suffer from the same disease, but each has a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation can't stop the illness, but always can alleviate her symptoms.
Physical activity also stimulates the immune status of the organism, which is in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another encouraging sign of regular exercise is the fact that you are sick, what can handle everything, and it builds their confidence.
"during the exercise, the endorphins up, too, and they make you feel good," notes: Camilla řasová of rehabilitation medicine at the University Hospital of Vinohrady.
The fact that the physical side of our relationship, we operate on the limbic system, responsible for emotions.
Right so we get into the psyche of even immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"previously, these patients are saved, we now know that they need a targeted," says Professor J.R. Pavel Kolar, chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University Hospital in Motol.
The aim of physical therapy is to remain independent for as long as possible, including the post.
Therefore, physiotherapists working with ergoterapeuty, for every person in the world to get the compensatory aid made his peace.
Many of the patients needs and the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When it comes to the life of a serious illness, most people can see this.
They're experiencing shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to a major burden - the loss of health.
With such aching souls have gone to someone, not to try to take everything on his shoulders.
"I work with them, so that it finally came to the conclusion that, even with a handicap you can live a full life and multiple sclerosis, that doesn't mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata raspberry - Schubert from the neurological clinic of the general University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague latecoere manufacturer Airbus would not fly.
Aircraft production is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technologies.
The new planes are full of titanium or solid and light composite materials, which are now so someone can't make and process.
Still, it's next to superpřesných, computerized machine tools, next to the autoclaves for shaping the composites hit on something so out of the ordinary, such as apricot seeds.
In the drum, which recalls the pot on the cotton candy, in a pile of stones to espouse the edges of metal parts, which just came out of the frézovacího machines.
"no one has yet come up with anything better," says Ivan Dubský, Director General of the aviation manufacturer latecoere, Czech Republic.
On the premises in a Prague Vystaviste produced earlier Letov complete the door to Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world, supplying the door for Brazilian Embraer 170.
The door, part of which will be drawn up in Prague, also come in first and upper class passengers on the upper decks of the world's largest passenger plane, the Airbus A380.
They're installed here the door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the motto here.
Maybe the seeds leaves the company adjusted twice a year.
If the yellow sticker missed the record, they should be in a race to explain what auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who rides regularly to check if the doors are produced according to the agreed rules.
Human senses but advanced technology not yet.
On one door to the A320 is 1500 rivets.
You must shake nýtaři manually.
It takes them two days ago.
Even the sound of hammers to see if it's already shaky right rivet.
Tolerance, in which they move, it is the minimum.
Rivet above the surface of the aircraft can go from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
When it comes to a number of trained touch.
When the controller over a finger along the line of rivets, it knows if one is out of tolerance.
Then take in hand the precise úchylkoměr.
Letov fed before 1989 L-39 training programme for military aircraft.
But in 1991 he made neither one.
The firm had to quickly find a new contract.
Back then, together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for the supplier of the emergency door for the A321 model.
Courtship with Boeing were not so lucky.
"when we were a small company, which did not have enough money for investment and to Boeing can guarantee a long-term stable supply," recalls the outcome.
The door to the American manufacturers would remain closed if Letov in 1999 delivered at the Prague Conference of the International Association of French aerospace industry group latecoere.
I was talking about our collaboration with Airbus.
The second day started with a meeting with the French, says the outcome.
A year later, the Czech firm latecoere bought and companies with a new contract.
In the year 2000, the start of the Assembly doors for the A320.
Three years later, the door on the upper deck of the A380.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for processing composites for supplies for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without latecoere we ourselves to these big contracts.
Maybe we're doing parts or small parts.
The partners want guarantees of supply for twenty or thirty years, explains the outcome.
Last year, the Czech latecoere, reaching over 2.9 billion and after tax profits 147 million kronor.
An exclusive position between suppliers and aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague since 2000 has invested 1.5 billion crowns.
The company must have certificates of quality, certification, 170 special manufacturing processes, and the IDs of the qualifications for key staff.
Without them the company would have no door to the aircraft.
To obtain the certificates, that manufacturing processes meet the requirements of customers, and the multiple checks to keep costs under voyage million crowns.
The production processes changed every year.
They are more accurate and more stringent.
We have the staff, equipment and dovybavovat doškolovat again the process to certify the outcome, he adds.
Now, the company is completing the preparation process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the existing human harmful cadmium.
The award was received from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology for equipment or chemicals, which are used in Prague.
The people of Boeing will come, check out the design across the line.
Then the production of the show.
Check our laboratory.
One set of samples to test themselves in his lab and then compare the results with the outcome, the way in which it is controlled by customers.
The reward is Prague ’ s firm long-term exclusive contracts.
With today's race, Prague and falling production embraerů.
For the A320 family generates half of the total volume of the door.
Replace the Czech latecoere is for European or Brazilian manufacturer either impossible, or very difficult.
That does not mean, however, that the door might say at any cost.
Part of the contract's price curve.
This indicates how many doors will be after ten, fifty, hundred of pieces produced.
The price for a piece of falling to a specific limit value.
The price of formula, we need to go.
If not, we are experiencing the outcome, he says.
Half of the hall, where he built the electrical closet for military Airbus a400 m, is still empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, there is building new polorobotická line on the riveting and fitting doors for an innovative model of the A320 Neo.
The riveting speed and precise.
"this is the trend, which the assembly in aviation is going," adds the outcome.
Sales of the future has been secured.
Airbus says airlines have so far ordered 3278 units of the new model of the A320.
Just a couple of yards off line for a complete assembly of the door for the upper deck of the A380.
It's a strategic decision our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production and lower costs.
The full assembly could begin within two years, says the outcome.
However, the company must go through before qualification tests should be for the assembly of certain electronic and electrical equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is betting on further development of production of composite materials.
In addition to the Boeing should also take part in the new Airbus A350, which will compete with the Dreamliner.
"for a company that's huge credit, if they can process materials besides metallic and composite," he says proudly, the outcome.
Latecoere, however, in the Czech Republic is on the edge of the production capacity.
In the area of Letov, where another place is not.
Prior to the entry of the French company's 180 employees.
Now there's 800 and within three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as they will be Airbus and Boeing compete to see how many of the hundreds of new aircraft, the airline each year, the order might not have a job.
Although he has a contract for a few years, the parent company of the Prague latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group should have enough money for the September loan repayments.
In the end, she could deal with major creditors latecoere.
At the end of August, a proportion of the loans for shares traded.
Creditors in the company of a capital increase to €57.4 million share of 37.4 percent.
The company's debt has fallen by two thirds, that is about EUR 180 million.
The second part of the recovery of the financial system came at the beginning of September.
The company has subscribed to the new shares to existing shareholders 222,9 million euro.

Members support a greater share of State charges for coal.
The change in fees for the extraction of minerals is to bring to the Treasury about 427 million more than in 2013.
On revenue budgets of the view of the government is to have a neutral impact, because the fee is to be higher.
In the year of the fee received from roughly 450 million kroner and the State budget of 150 million kroner.
From brown coal mining was about $200 million for municipalities and State 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in payments from the mining space to the mining for 1,000 kronor per hectare per year.
The revenue from these charges is still in its entirety belong to municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD), told members that the municipalities that gain a year instead of the 14 million to 100 million kroner.
The amount of mining fees won't be determined by law, but by the government.
The payment will be calculated by multiplying the number of newly harvested the mineral and rates for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, is the reason for the amendment, among other things, the possibility of flexible reactions to the current economic situation.
Member of the ODS Marek Benda, but warned that the fee by the government doesn't have to be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to the Minister, a doctor in this case, however, it's not a tax, because it is levied on mineral, which is state property.
The fees are only municipalities, whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining will get three quarters of the money municipalities and a quarter of the State.
The same ratio will be even in the case of mining radioactive rocks.
Part of the money, which the State mining royalties will be ring-fenced.
For example, 28 percent will have to go on damage control, after logging, mining or to ensure the emergency services.
A draft today criticised the Opposition members who argued, in particular, that the municipalities affected by the mining and the region.
For example, a (TOP 09 and the mayors), warned that mining companies no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they pay higher fees directly into the State budget.
"it is not possible to tunnel in one of the poorest regions, only the Minister of Finance to improve budget," said David Kádner (dawn) elected in Ústí.
Prior to the increase in unemployment, pro Party MP warned Hannah aulická.
Kádner and aulická unsuccessfully proposed amendments to be rejected, he wanted to go back to the government the Škoda completion.
The report says that, according to the mining companies to increase fees reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent of the contracted in the long term.
The main consumers such as power plants or CHP should therefore not price growth.
"on the other hand, however, this really increases the risk that mining companies will be compensated for the increase of efforts to reduce its operating expenses, which primarily means reducing the number of employees," says the government.
It is, however, an increase in fees from the point of view of employment.
According to the rapporteur, to the novel by Milan Urbana (ČSSD) is the key to members before the approval of the law knew the conclusions on the updated Energy Master Plan and the Government's decision about the limits on coal mining.
If coal will also benefit the limits, then it will have implications for the proceeds for the State and municipalities, he pointed out.
Urban disagrees with Mládek, in that the decision of the breaking down of the Czechoslovak army should fall until after 2020.
Limits on the CSA down, he says, should break it for social reasons, and because of the long term stability of the domestic energy sector.
The time for a decision on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The whole world is watching how the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision about whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists contacted by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve will take the decisions, now thinks it will stay dormant for some time, and still retain the interest rate in the range of 0-0,25 percent.
It's a historic event, because it's been years since he sat down, when the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, the closer we get to a situation where the central bank might be able to get out of the bar to zero, and to start the process of normalizing interest rates, "says Angel ubide, manager at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The American economy is doing relatively well, there has been a recovery in terms of adding trillions of dollars to the State, and a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less pink global perspective.
The markets have been warned to be prepared for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that he also sees a big chance against that step.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday, 20: 00 CET.
The shooter left a note, Delta State University
Shannon Lamb, who on Monday shot and killed his girlfriend in Mississippi - and later the same day, and a colleague wrote a message in which he says he's "Sorry" the first murder and he wishes he could take it back, revealed on Tuesday, and government agencies.
Police in gautieru in Mississippi stated that the lamb, a geography teacher and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning, around 10 hours
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send police to his house.
He said: "last night, I shot my wife," and also mentioned that the house is “cute dog, ” which“ will not bother anybody ”, but he's upset.
The police demanded the names of the caller, but Lamb.
Lamb also did not explain why the shots were fired in the house.
When police arrived at the scene found the body 41leté Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb, who said: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I love Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me. "
After leaving a message to Lamb went a long way to go to university, 300 miles from the Delta, where a history teacher killed Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
Dean of the College of William La Forge said he didn't know about any conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but that "in Mr Lamb's head, apparently there was something going on. ”
Despite the Monday announcement about lamb allegedly believed in a romantic relationship with Amy Prentiss Schmidt, government authorities have indicated that a “love triangle ” there is“ no evidence ”.
Shawn O ’ Steen, who had been married for over seven years with Prentiss said that it was "a great person".
The divorce was 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
A 19-year-old daughter o Steen and Prentiss case was “shaken up ”.
O ’ Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsay Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as stated by the sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named bolt, she went with the lamb for about three years.
"she always wanted to help others, ” said Knowles.
The police stated that the lamb on Monday spoke to his relatives and said, "he's going to jail".
When police caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later the same night, lamb, he stopped and ran off into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to a biography posted on the website of the school, lamb had a PhD in education at the University of delta in the spring of 2015.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be a few months out of the game for a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this injury that left defenders left in tears and knocked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and he thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
Injuries caused by reckless intervention - Moreno in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw pushed his way into the area of PSF.
Nine minutes and was treated on the field and was also needed an oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "he suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
Will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the next day, and then further surgery in Manchester.
It's terrible - the boy who comes to Manchester in 18 years, it's very hard, but he's playing fantastic, and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he was also wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of therapy and wouldn't be able to play in the group stage.
I believe that he will play again this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli Mexican, though.
Van gall, he indicated that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for themselves whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly surgery on both legs.
A tweet from the account, Shaw says: "thank you everyone for all their news," words cannot express how devastated my road to recovery begins now, and I'll come back even stronger. "
Related: Manchester United's Luke Shaw have injuries in the defeat against PSV
English defender will have added motivation to the recovery in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip coke, coach of PSV, he said: "it was a very nasty wound."
If any player leaving the field with an injury like this, everybody is very sad.
It's never the aim of our players to hurt the opposition.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in the match against Mexico, Van Gaal's Holland at the World Cup in 2014.
"it's very difficult for him, because his intention was not to hurt opposing players, and when you hear about the severity of that injury, it's not good," said coke.
I wasn't able to see this moment.
I just saw the ball, who was heading in the other direction, so it seemed to him [Moreno], but I haven't seen surgery on Luke.
In an interview for the sbs6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult it can be such a thing.
I feel very badly, I'm very sorry.
A player of PSF Andrés saved was also taken to the hospital after Chris smallinga.
David Cameron certainly knows the better the Lorax?
This thing every parent knows: when you fall in love with a book, it doesn't take long before you'll teach her almost by heart.
Of course, it can't be David Cameron.
In response to the paediatric service providers, to name his favorite children's book, he chose the President of the government, the Lorax, a Dr Seuss story from 1971.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in the report, published on the website of the company supercamps and continues: "funny, touching, creative and with strong content, that I like to read to their children, because it was always the image or message, which I haven't seen before."
Well, except that in the following paragraph Cameron allegedly described the book referred to in the elevator of a movie of 2012, added more characters and details, filed a brief on the original text.
"in the town of thneed-ville walled, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by complying with her wishes to see a real tree," is a summary of the content of the book, which is the object of love the Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that alone wasn't enough suspicious text supplied Cameron reads like a summary of the film the Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "in the city, walled thneed-ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would meet with the plot of the book, where the unnamed young man know that local nature is greedy, trees, removing industrialista Once-ler, who despite the protests the cover loraxe, crouched, mustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, so relatively few significant PR challenge got a sidekick, who never read the Lorax child 20 times in a row.
A spokesman for Downing Street said that the text probably came from the office of Cameron.
Supercamps confirmed that the text has provided an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam lyth was in danger of omission, but is still holding
Compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team that England selected for this tour, I will be repeating the 3-0 defeat suffered the last time in a test series, not very likely.
Also, I wouldn't rule out a win.
Party Alastair Cook may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup, and also the collective thinking is strong; bear the scars of 2012, only a youthful positivity.
With the ball, moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and emerging spinner, even if it is unknown to level the test series, represents the possibility of an attack.
Related: Adam lyth fell out of the England team experienced in the series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to mention Adam lytha for me is hard to analyse, because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests was against two good attacks in demanding conditions, and simple, but the harsh reality is that cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, about the name Joe root, there were no question marks, which led to the announcement, because — and this I've already stated previously — players are their best'but.
A few other half-century and lyth could extend his series, but it had control over its own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, it's another opportunity.
The England coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even if his performance were not exactly 100%, and it doesn't surprise me; he's always been a team player.
The question of how much of a test batsman gets time to show he's a tough nut to crack.
Lyth got seven caps — as well as Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance at home and abroad.
The only thing I could complain about is that, as soon as possible in the Caribbean gave England a chance Jonathan trottovi — though lyth was in the best form — but this wasted opportunity is in the past.
Is Alex Hales, and that's a batsman, which I'm very positively.
It's x-faktorový cricketer that we've seen here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when we get on the field at Trent Bridge, 236 of which so little was done.
He must at least be afforded the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all this will of course depend on the overall lineup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, when moeen begins alongside cook, which would have got the extra spinner while retaining four Quicks, was raised, and I have no reservations against it.
I don't understand why he can't launch strokemaker and a left-handed man has already demonstrated that he is a great cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was the number 3 and a big difference in it.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, first played the first of his 38 tests in front of his performance in the year 2001.
His "three centuries and never looked back.
The team comes as a back-up spinner Zafar Ansari and when I had the opportunity to watch him take me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross statistics — an average of 31 to 35 with the bat and with the ball — and I see it as a boat, but not a lot of spinnerů, who raised their hands, and selektoři opted for youth.
There's a lot of that on this tour.
Outside the team, it appears that England made a few changes and a smart addition to their coaching staff.
The appointment of batsman mahela jayawardenea, from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches can be a master stroke.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who bring experience that have experience with all the conditions and all of the attacks.
Paul Collingwood is in the part of the white-ball tour and will bring to the team as the energy, so ruthless a spark.
I've always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, either as a player or coach, and as well as mahela has intellect, which I can use.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they're consistent voices saying things that have been said before, they may occasionally lighten and freshen up the atmosphere.
Teammate Ben Stokes collyho Durham got the day off, as well as root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this Decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and selektoři create a timetable.
And you have to remember, as the players that their job depends on results.
Such a decision cannot be taken lightly.
Campaign for Brexit could prevail in 2017, if the economy starts to stagnate.
Half-baked David Cameron's renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with every day that passes without the election of Jeremy's "is that a yes or a no?" Corbyn to the head of the Labour Party, or will take you to the TUC on Tuesday to hand the whole situation around Europe.
Foreigners are also his corbyna and Nigel faragese.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained, as Europe is mired in various crises - not all of which are their own fault - some Member States already have enough British egocentric agenda, concessions and disruptive changes to the Treaty, most of which wouldn't.
At its Annual Meeting in Brighton with the TUC, has decided that they don't want it even if it weakened social protection.
We could even call it a selfie agenda Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor goes to the bilateral Summits or meetings in foreign capitals, they take a picture in front of the famous local monument, with or without the local dignitaries, and then come back home with the words that win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to wear nezahleděnou Britain in European Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some myopic ministers and officials in some major cities to get to a point when they leave care.
Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, carefully balanced is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and he wants to leave his post, than for her to be in the wrong, as it has for too long, continuous Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand and Kohl) (14) (16).
The Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is declining, too.
Poland may soon have the nationalist government on the right hand side, Spain, on the left.
It is difficult to see how the selfie to help break the legs of the British people who might invest more energy in order to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want to, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these may be planning ministers deliberately unhelpful remarks style of the SNP during the campaign ahead of a referendum in 2017 the UK to accelerate the process of Brexit, says a friend.
"the renegotiation to address the problem" and "Britain doesn't have anything of value out of the negotiations."
The Europeans to their own detriment, they know how predatory he can be in Fleet Street, and how the EU are skeptical of the press barons, oligarchs, because they weren't inspired by Tony Benn during the referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in a ratio of 2: 1.
You may vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, dishonest euro-oportunistu, who made his name as a Brussels correspondent "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his vanity Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
Include a mixture of taxes, non-payment of rogues, strangers hackujících phones and pseudo nezámořské departments, which owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, one of Tony Blair thought the same thing, but he realized that when you're in a cage with violent gorilla, she must throw bananas, to give you to dinner and then to tea.
In fact, he was more like a Blair than Miliband, Blair himself, when he said Cameron ’ s referendové routine, since Blair accepted the principle of the EU Constitution repealed, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned his card.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who on Monday in Westminster a friendly pat on the back - I told him that I'm not wasting my time - seems to be in danger of accepting the strategy of boycotting Murdoch, Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy involving the media, not me, but I'm sure with Andrew Marr, whose chair at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe, I say it nicely, develops.
Claims that he wanted to stay in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the rabid UKIP tendency and wild on the banks of the Tory's small englanderismu May I'm sure.
It's the same thing, "said Hilary bemm, but no benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner boy scout couldn't bring himself to admit that abrazivního corbynovo Appointment of McDonnell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father fought on TV about his sense of loyalty, without going too far and lost his job.
The game Hillary was much more attractive.
But to fight for it, to stay "in all circumstances" - bennina phrase - apparently, it wasn't, what McDonnell did or what JC said colleagues and members on their private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the background, sensitive image that Corbyn wants to say - don't forget, he touched me - that discipline reports remains important in the age of television all day and particularly in faith, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal of social media
Is it fair for Cameron not to provide a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the labor party in referendové campaign for granted, as stated by the McDonnell.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But mcdonnellovo and corbynovo basic equivocation about membership of the EU - in accordance with their economy, the Bennite anti-kapitalistickou past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussions between leftist dissidents, for which it is the narcissism of small differences, the central principle of the dogmatic bickering.
Just like with his rationalization about NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that the campaign doesn't want to put an end to this JC - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their own masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin to spend political capital - are also suspicious voters - the concessions for Britain when it seems pointless.
The United States are already quite disappointed from the British "a weak military power in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, and that even with cost cutting, a conservative government in power, as I was reminded on Monday night the start of something, what was the name of the Security Forum of British influence.
Experts criticise the electronic Review published by public health England
A statement by the government funded agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking, came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links with the tobacco industry, the researchers argue.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), they joined the Lancet review of the evidence in their report on electronic cigarettes by public health England (Phe).
The Agency published the Phe "mezníkovou" report last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and draw attention to the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Journal, Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy basis" on which the Agency Phe based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ, challenged the claim, which was supposedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "the fundamental principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of efficacy."
They indicate that the general public might expect, that's a statement of the Agency, the Phe "the current best estimate is that the e-cig are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one of the 12 people meeting convened to develop multi-kritéria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their views on damages associated with the different products containing nicotine; the results were summarized in a research report.
McKee and capewell points out that one of the sponsor of that meeting was a company called euroswiss health, whose general manager allegedly has previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent study.
Also endorsed the credentials of public health of the bat in the sustainability report, States.
One of 12 participants in the meeting said the funding from the makers of electronic cigarettes, but no financing, which allegedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for the choice of the members of the panel is not available, but it contains several known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of which also claim in the paper industry funding.
Some of the others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
Meeting in the Phe also participated in tobacco control.
The report arising in this group, "admits" missing "hard evidence about the evils of most products on most of the criteria," wrote McKee and capewell.
However, none of these references or restriction is not described in the Phe report.
McKee and capewell said Phe claims that "so far, there is no evidence that the e-cig acted as a path to smoking for children or non-smokers," it was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at phe, said that the allegations in the BMJ's been answered before.
He said: "electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the public health risk posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we need to continue to examine the long-term effects.
Phe has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and what not, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative risk compared with tobacco.
Almost 80 000 people a year die from diseases related to smoking and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
A clear emphasis on current evidence - that even if the e-cig is not without risks, are only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fill our national competence.
The BBC should end up with EastEnders, says former director of Channel 4
A former director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as Eastenders and the voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would give their right arm for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should be used only for the programmes which are not made up of other British television.
BBC criticised for her public service programmes, which will likely see only a handful of people, in complex times, compared with its rivals "biggest rating show, and on channels such as bbc4.
After Director General Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said, he was trying without success to the connection with the BBC for six years, which he worked on Channel 4.
"I'm struggling with the idea that the BBC and broadcasting programmes that would surely have been broadcast rivals without the contributions of the state," Johnson said in the Commission for the communication in the upper house, as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you can keep your licence fees, which, I'm not sure whether they are in the medium or long term is a good idea, should reduce the production of at least as regards the other programmes, which does not produce or not.
The voice, broadcast in prime time, because they want to get the widest possible support in the future.
The idea that no one else would have him, it's a funny joke, and, of course, absurd.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programmes, which may be financed by bezpříspěvkově.
The voice is one of them, the other in EastEnders, and, of course, produced on home soil.
Honestly other channels for them would be just right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting service.
I don't think it would in no way undermine the BBC.
Johnson, a businessman in the area who led the series, Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he feels guilty that he drove ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comment about the popular BBC show repeats that the former executive director of the sky, Tony ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC will sell a show like EastEnders.
Johnson said that even hýčkanější public service programmes the BBC "passes on bbc4, where quite often cannot be measured in the audience, but his power and can argue when they embark on their mission of false justification for £4BN income from royalties," but of course we're doing all these obscure programmes, for which no one is looking. "
It is broadcast at a time when no one was looking at them.
As for the licence fee to the Commission, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find regresivnější system about who can get the best out of him.
Of course we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for the people, which is £150 a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much, because they don't look so much at the BBC.
The former director of the sky and Channel 5, David elstein, who spoke before the Commission on Tuesday, he said that the BBC should revise their reithovskou mission in the sense of "inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that a small volume of production for the BBC was previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% of the TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take a public role model for public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and to change to "inform, to explain and talk."
On the partnership elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms, which was aired on television only a handful, and to connect with the commercial to reporters, you could see them all online.
“sonogenetika ’ or control the brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound pulses influence the direction in which the nematodes.
Scientists bred worms with genetically modified the nervous system, which can control the sound waves.
Tiny nematodes changing direction at a time when they are affected by sound pulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses are working so that they switch cells genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: scientists can read and write brain activity using light
The scientists argued that these worms are a perfect example of the new methodology called sonogenetika, which uses ultrasound to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells and activate cells outside the body.
Sreekanth chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, explained to the guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure, in which a patient's brain electrodes that stimulate the brain lymphoma-specific. Such method is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson ’ s disease.
The nematode typically respond to an ultrasound, but chalasani found that the reaction will be when it is placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
How did the ultrasound waves, bubbles, which then passes through the body of the worms.
Enhanced ultrasound waves in trp-4 ion channels, which are located in the membranes of certain cells of the worms.
Thank you sound waves, these channels open and activate cells, to which they are linked, according to a report in the journal Nature communications.
In order to control the nematodes using ultrasonic waves, chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain trp-4 ion channels.
Then, when he used the modified worms ultrasound, the sound waves were amplified by mikrobublinami and transferred to the worms, where on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is much like optogenetice, groundbreaking tools, which allow scientists to turn the neurons on and off using light.
But chalasani, sonogenetika could have compared to many of the benefits of this technique.
Unlike the light, which must be sent to the optical fibre to the desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves to penetrate tissues without limit and be sent directly into the brain.
"we believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can focus on the human neurons and make them susceptible to temporarily ultrasonic signals used in the clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases," says chalasani.
He added that his method would be found in the treatment of muscle cells and the cells that produce insulin.

A cheerful voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that the advertising on the world's largest arms fairs, is a sharp parody created for the amnesty international to highlight the willingness of the British government selling arms to repressive regimes across the defence and security equipment International jamborees in the Excel centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also being conducted with a year of posters at bus stops and the meters, which require a second look.
"important notice, travel on the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" read one, using a font with the brands of the London underground and DLR lines becomes an image of a tank.
In September this year will be the arms dealers descend on the DLR... customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are created by artists who put their work at the museum of design in Banksy's cruel dismalandu.
The collective name of the Special Patrol Group is helping distribute all over London and using the "ad space hack packs", which is £6 for a piece of Allen keys, who allegedly "can gain access to approximately a third of bus stops advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flypostingovým "vandalism."
One of the advertising staff produced a parody of the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin grindona, curator of cruel designs and an assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists still more challenging and trying to show the political activity of the audience outside the gallery.
A lot of artists to work with activists in the protest movement, and they realize that needs to get out in the real world, their art to the impact on the company.
One of the other posters against the arms trade on the health of the passengers on the subway.
The video was on Facebook has been viewed more than 100 000 people in 24 hours, and was created by the Agency vccp working without a fee and a graphic designer and commentator, also worked for free.
Creative director Matt vccp lever would be surprised at the silence surrounding the advertising on arms trade - saw an empty space in the calendar, a spreadsheet, and I thought: "let's show them the campaign, which is trying to avoid."
They played in the creation of a more realistic risky corporate advertising, but "the addition of bright colors and animation, I do think it will attract more people."
"they did a fantastic job and help us raise concerns about selling nelegálích torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in the amnesty.
What we need now, is that the United Kingdom Government has adopted measures and to ensure that, with the torture devices of illegally trading on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside the Excel, where exhibitors selling a fantastic product.
In a press release the company Saab has revealed an order from the U.S. Army to "shoulder launch at4cs Rs."
This includes the "uniquely shaped warhead, which provides stunning effects from the armor inside target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for student life on campus
11 years ago I moved to a 19-year-old college student as ignorant, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but, until now, I recall a tense smiles of those, which I did - and multiple, lengthy complaints on the other.
Everything I have learned can be distilled down to eight simple rules.
Moving on the tracks, it can range from a slightly irritating to totally appalling.
It's tempting to babbling: tell people where you're from, if you take a year off, what's your opinion on corbyna and why "honestly you don't even no I hate Marmite, because people, it's just the yeast extract, hahaha, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe, too - ask questions and show interest.
It's run by the conversation and help you to find the people you love, and you, that you would not even if your eyelashes were on fire and they're making a fire extinguisher.
Give people space.
Room people often change drinking at reception, places, film nights and municipal public places, but they're also the room where people dress up and adjusting their underwear.
Related: don't even think about it, you think you started college and be in a relationship
Introverts are high.
Your room should be a haven, but a lot of the tracks into the mimopokojovou culture, which is a friendly, outgoing and contributes to the lifelong friendship.
It can be hell for anyone who needs to recharge.
No culture permits you to say, "I love you and I want to continue our friendship, but I need you to leave, to go back to the energy I had used to talk with you."
Try to know when a classmate's tired of socialization - and maybe write him a knock.
Speaking of: knock knock.
One kid in my dorm had a habit of that, if the doors are locked, it's invited in.
Saw a couple of things.
Make friends with baking.
Because you started going to university on the top of baking mania, knocking on a stranger's door and show with plate upečenými cakes seems slightly less awkward, less than "welcome to the neighbourhood, I've made you smile now, while I'm going to ask personal questions."
Offering local delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommate will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe it's all over, so that your face to a tasty surprise.
It is, of course, the fact that you're a decent Baker.
Wrong condensed pieces of flour, sugar and jams, that will probably lead the others pretend to sleep, if you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is common on college campuses.
The theft of the chicken, of course, is a crime, but it's a little bit of milk to your tea theft?
Check it twice with the owner of the milk.
There is a chance that you offer milk when they go inside.
If someone steals something, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little bit more mature than my roommate, who traded his milk as a means of washing the dishes, to punish thieves.
Now he's in jail.
You shouldn't make noise that distracts people from their sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you are also known for people in glass houses.
A girl from my hall asked her neighbors if they would turn down a drum and bass because there were 3 in the middle of the night and in the morning she had a test.
Their answer was to amplify the music.
When it finally fell silent at 5 o'clock in the morning, let them sleep for two hours and then let out loud his own music, locked the door and left her on a three-hour exam.
It wouldn't be romantic, if your future husband went to the same college as you?
And on the other hand, wouldn't it be terribly embarrassing if you have the wrong roommate for his future wife, slept together, split up and they had to see each other every day, and it might also take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants - but if your roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try to talk to at least a little bit with his groin.
In the afternoon, the moment when you realize that someone had left the keys in their unlocked room, there's a fine line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable lesson about the fun and their security by hiding something - never don't ruin someone's room and toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door for them and give them the keys to the bottle of water, which was then put in the freezer - but they do not stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva is looking forward to the twins, despite the uncertain outlook for the future.
Eve's been through some rough times in pregnancy with a seven-year-old vítkem today.
His father broke up with her, and to prepare for and raising the child alone.
With the situation I'm dealt relatively quickly - so I'm looking forward to the baby, and I was looking at the positives.
The uncertainty and the fact that I'm a child myself, I'm trying not to.
And I'm sure I had a hope, that we are not alone, she says on the eve of their first pregnancy.
Then she met on the Internet in a chat room, a senior who had started to talk about his favorite movies.
Vasek Eva with vítkem even brought him home from the hospital, but in the role of a father is too hasty.
"for a while, then pulled out of the programme," she described Eva in the documentary series four at the 3.
A third series of the show, Czech Television is just the pursuit of happiness at the second attempt.
The care of the financial security of families did so thanks to a part-time job, and a big bailout to help mothers and aunts.
Not even the prospect of responsibility for someone else's child eventually Vaska's affection for Eva spoil.
Definitely get together around vítkových second birthday and he now sees as his father, and also a address him as such.
Even though my two grown-up daughters, no longer true paternity in sixty according to their words, and the kids are also more.
In addition to Vitek added another two years and I'm finally twins.
"true to our family into the kind of naturally, perhaps even by my mother in the relationships didn't talk much," he smiles.
Few places?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and ELA was born by C-section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis during pregnancy in the conclusion.
It is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which are present in excessive quantities in the blood of pregnant women and, in particular, the itching.
The disease is dangerous for unborn fetus facing premature birth and death for mothers after childbirth usually resolve spontaneously.
EMA and ELA to Eva's and Vaska's luck they were born healthy, even if it was only in the 36th week.
Emičku placed in an incubator at the intermediate ward, where he works and vaškova niece, who made her take over and check in.
Elinka was larger and right after the transport from the intensive care unit of a room I had it with me, describes the difficult period after giving birth to Eva.
In hospital she spent 20 days, until doctors nesvolili with release of babies, who had managed to reach the border of two pounds.....
Waiting for the weight gain in children in the maternity Eva joy but it didn't.
"I was mad with her husband and children," recalls the difficult moments in the postpartum period quadruple mother.
She and her husband even signing a statement of liability due to, inter alia, necitlivému access to one of the doctors.
But, in the end, and the doctor was released with the twins, Eve and into a care home.
The stories of four pregnancies and births sends CT1 on Tuesday night at 21: 45 hours.
A large family can downsize.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with the electric dvouplotýnkou and crowded conditions.
A house had increased, but William did Eve happy gas stove is mounted to the preparation of food for the six people more comfortable.
When will nejůř, we take turns on a cab.
Eva is convinced that children, in particular, the perception of family and a pleasant atmosphere, and no size or shabbiness.
For now, we're piecing together very well, better than we expected.
The mess was harder to hide in a small space and kutalející babies are sometimes, but at least we're all around, smiling, Eva, who can find a positive side to every situation.
Vaškova work with lighting a movie is no guarantee of a regular income.
That's why sometimes goes out into the streets as a taxi driver.
In his 60 years in the care of the finances of the family and the children physically can, how long it will be?
"I realize that, due to our age difference that I'm the one who's going to support this family," admits Eva straight when asked about the future.
She'd like to go back to work, but even more it attracts the possibility of their own business.
With four kids, I'm not a bargain for the employer.
If the worst comes to the worst, we can take turns with her husband, joking about a nice blonde.
Apple had a yo-yo effect.
For everything they can display.
Faster processor, a camera with higher resolution, the stronger the chassis or speech-recognition force touch display, that's the short version of the recently introduced the ninth generation of the iPhone.
The two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6S and 6s plus.
The current trend for apple was that each new generation of iPhone is easier than the previous one.
The exception were only the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to the previous iphonům.
Dvougramový weight difference, to the detriment of the news was truly negligible.
It's the new iPhone, however, far from being the case.
Compared to last year's 6 and 6 plus iphonům the mass had grown at a smaller model about 14 grams for more then about 20 grams.
On the one hand, no wonder the affair last year, bending in pockets, apple racked up considerably.
The chassis of the news is that of the stronger aluminium alloy 7000, which also reflect the weight.
But the much bigger impact they have on her screen.
Apple is using the new technology, 3D touch, which they can display the power of touch.
It was necessary to display another layer of capacitive sensors.
Mass displays of new iPhones compared to previous generations, has increased by more than double.
One of the smaller iPhone originally from 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of larger then from 19 to 40 grams.
The iPhone 6s's screen, the hardest part of the component.
Weight only 143 grams is then for this news achieved thanks to a treadmill, which touched on most of the remaining components.
The larger model is then applied to the most difficult element of the battery, its weight, however, compared with predecessors.
Even in this case, it's the biggest increase was seen in the display.
The weight of the iPhone 6s plus, at 5.5 ", is 192 grams.
How much will the new display technology, will not take effect until use.
The first users will be able to test it on the Friday, September 25, when it will be launched in selected countries, sales of iPhones 6S and 6s plus.
The flakes are the breakfast of champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta paglicci, archaeologists have made a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered that the population of modern humans of different ages, including wall paintings, remains of tools, and so on and so forth.
The 23a, which is dated instruments until around 30 years ago scientists discovered, but something very like the breakfast buffet.
In fact, the traces of oat grains, which obviously went through a process of production, so popular today.
The grains soak, then dry first today, get rid of the package, the so-called glumellae, then steamed and rozlisují flat.
Cave in paglicci were able to discover grains, which was apparently nahřáta or buried, and then he was crushed between a rock and a hard place - to at least suggest the use of tracks on two stones in a cave.
The scientists therefore failed in its publication for the magazine PNAS demonstrate that the cave was a complete production process, but the resemblance is striking.
We have no evidence about how people could eat cereal, but the theory that it was with a liquid and maybe even warm, of course, is entirely logical.
At the same time, it's a very interesting document of how intensely people use cereals long before the development of agriculture.
If it is the oldest vločková interpretation is correct, the cereal ahead of agriculture about twenty thousand years.
New train station in the city of Brno.
So I listened once again to report the names of the stops in the trolleybus: hnusáčkova, a ghost, frázova spratecká.
Of course, the car was a bit noisier, so reports a man ’ s voice was a little less clear than before, when the station reported in a female voice.
A woman's voice is higher, so the noise of traffic is more recognizable than the deeper the man's voice.
Although dpmb.cz argues that the anchor chose the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but I'm sure that out of the studio recordings made in silence, which, of course, were quite otherwise than in the noise of the bus engine.
I live in Brno a few decades, so the names of all those zastávkek I know by heart, so I don't need this report, but foreigners from somewhere else, they don't know who in Brno and for which they are intended, in particular, this report may be confused and may on the final, where they got by mistake, and then claim that the stop, which should get out of the car, was not reported.
Maybe he should be the choice of speaker - but better anchor again - do it again, and this time, tinged with the usual traffic noise and the noise of the engine in which the bleating of a speaker on the bus is almost lost.
So we don't have to keep listening to the names of the stations, water heršpice šmírova, or then dive in the creaking šalině, to which I transferred in the competition.
I assume that my old man's hearing had worsened suddenly so much during that one day, when the announcer calls changed.
Before that day I understood the reports quite well.
Good morning, sir.
From the notes traťováka.
Not many people know this, what the government ’ s biggest and brightest were so-called comprehensive background checks.
I took the liberty to reminisce.
The bus was late.
In the Controller's office into the moment he came on the radio, that's just seven hours.
"you're lucky, that you hit with Comrade Chief, came a minute before you, and it seems that's not in the mood," said the dispatcher, while I'm writing in a log book.
Thanks, I'll watch it.
Tell me that I'm going after the districts for the revision of the little mechanisation.
It won't work, today there are background checks.
They are all scared of it.
What's it all about?
"you'll see," said the dispatcher.
Next time, you will be, too.
I ran out to the corridor.
The door opened and there was the chief náčelnikárny.
Stiff, with a straight face, in an impeccably tailored uniform.
"good morning, Master Chief," I said politely, and quickly switched the two buttons on his uniform jacket.
"good morning," came the reply, and I quickly ran to the second floor, he realized the cold, the ominous tone of the old said.
"you're messing with me," said engineer Eva, an elderly lady, which I appreciated.
She said she was even demoted, chief of her comrades.
They are vetting, and you get barely.
How many times have I asked you, what are you a comprehensive background checks, but one doesn't really want to talk about.
They tend to be once every three years, must the rest of them, and it's very unpleasant.
At least for some.
He said, however, I see.
I pulled out of the drawer in the file with the periodic reports and the phone.
"this holcman, come to me," said the chief's voice.
What is that?
Now we've met, and not... "I muttered, but no one answered me, alone with my thoughts.
"good morning, sir, I am here at your service," I, I barely omeldoval entered náčelnikárny.
The chief was sitting behind his desk and stared at a piece of paper.
"comrade mechanizátore," he said, without raising his head and looking closely at that paper, "your behaviour doesn't appeal to me."
He dropped the paper on the table, leaned back in his chair and stared at me watching the usual, unpleasant, bad, piercing.
I said.
What's going on?
Yesterday, his deputy, said that for a few months as I've worked out very well, and that to me is very happy.
The Chief did very well when he pulled me out of the squad for the long-haul event.
And now this?
You do realize that you're the tech track distance and that's all there is to it.
So, what did you use this morning, is simply unacceptable.
I said that, I use a greeting from my childhood, I was brought up that way and I don't see anything wrong with it.
The chief, it was like a red rag to a turkey.
"you're a socialist rail and the only acceptable greeting is an honour," said the chief of petulance.
And besides, you're still reaching out to his superiors.
Once you say "sir" and it's "comrade".
But for you I'm no master chief, but the chief comrade.
Deputies are comrades, deputy chief traťmistři are comrades chief traťmistři!
That's in your mind!
Excuse me, sir... sir, but I salute you normal civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... it's an honour and a job, or comrade... you know... I'm not in the side.
"it's not your priority, you're not in the cold side," said the chief, who had calmed down a little bit.
Still talking about that.
Anyway, remember that the top of the chair you have pre-paid into retirement.
It wasn't good.
When the chief said someone, something that is not his priority, with the concerned it didn't look good.
He stared at me for a moment, cold, piercing and I was looking for the words that I'd said.
I'm also annoyed that his condescending.
It was only a couple of years older and playing God, actually soudruhaboha.
A jovial, arrogant, authoritarian, arrogant, how he could use at the moment.
All to be even more.
So be it, it's the chief.
Actually, not all of them, the President of the party organisation he like all straníkům, but even nestraníkům, his first name.
But the chief with many, especially those in which he could exert his superiority.
Right now, I'm off for a full of shit.
I thought about my ass and it cost me a lot of effort for me to shoot him in the face.
But it didn't come back, I'd have to ride to the picks, let alone trying to do an official for railways.
What do I feed two kids?
And out of the house!
I was ready to cry but I controlled myself.
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
"that's all for now, you can go," an audience with the chief, and he began looking again, the paper, which had been in the hands.
At 11: 30 she called me.
All of the office were already there, and the question of what, and how, they said, yeah, that would be good.
Just jožin pointedly said, as was his custom, that they can't get us all out, because I would have had to do the job Comrade Chief himself, with his followers, and that there was no danger.
The word "comrade" pointed out, as if he knew what his old me this morning.
In náčelnikárně was a reunion.
Comrade Chief behind his desk, and at a long conference table the other comrades, who had to decide about my way of life or death.
Cadre, the President of the corner, the Secretary of the human resources officer for special purposes, something on the way to war, and Deputy kontráše, my boss.
And also the most important person, the President of the party organisation.
I knew him from the road.
A track worker podbíjel sleepers or pitchfork thrown gravel.
But also a former prison guard.
There were rumours at the time that it wasn't any fun, says a big beast.
Tongues, they claimed that he went to school in the seventh grade, no more trade, no he couldn't.
And when the prison was canceled, he ended up on a Sunday-afternoon picks.
But, comrade, well, yeah, it was comrade!
The chief, he motioned for me to sit down.
My heart in my throat, nespolknutelná cone.
Read the report of the Committee of civil personnel manager from a place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two kids, and so on and so forth.
So far, so good, I thought, and I breathe a little better.
Then the report from the organization.
This reflects the opinion of the Committee, is the same person wrote both.
But then it came!
Parents are longtime members of the party, refused to appear before the Commission and, subsequently, a revision from the speakers, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked sharply at me.
Personnel manager noticed and stopped reading.
The chief indicated that he should continue.
It was just worse.
I was a member of the municipal committee of the SSM, and there I was obtained for the candidate of the party.
Regardless of the parents, who are from the speakers, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and a wedding in addition to the National Committee, I was also in the church.
The trust of the party I have failed in the worst way.
That's why I was deleted from the ranks of its candidates.
But it wasn't enough.
I had two children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I said a church funeral, even though it was a former member of the party.
All that I show a negative attitude to the role of leader.
If you read only the Chief's personnel manager, tapping the table with pencils, punctuated by silence.
Everyone was staring at me and I wish I was somewhere far, far away.
I kept repeating to himself, "the Communists - supermen, communists - supermen." what have I got myself into?
Why I stayed in the Smiths?
Fixing points as I can without some crappy clearances.
But now?
An official for the career over before it began.
To return to the squad?
I don't think so, I'm sure the chief me for an hour.
"comrade, how were you there checking the comrade?" broke the silence on the issue a cadre.
Well, according to the report from a previous job.
You got it?
It was obviously not kádrovákovi twice.
Beads of sweat on the forehead, blinking nervously, as if he himself was prověřovaný.
He nodded vigorously and chief handed a piece of paper.
"well," the chief said with a hint of joviality, but which was often a precursor of a storm.
At first glance, the same praise, trained with honors, he graduated from college, he worked as a locksmith, the standard was, on average, a hundred and twenty percent.
But it is essential.
Where did you get that opinion, comrade? "he turned to a cadre, who felt that it kind of starts to turn against him, and that very soon, I hope he didn't even have to be kádrovákem.
This is Comrade, gave it to me at the onset.
That was enough for you?
"well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to the crew," the cadre.
And there are opinions not required, his was, somehow, so I put it in a folder.
"so, the inclusion of the technical features you this piece of paper," the chief said.
Cadre blinked nervously and didn't have the answers.
"never mind, we'll discuss it later," said the chief issue and kádrovákovi looked relieved.
For now, take it.
"what's the matter with you, comrade?" he asked the chief to me again.
Suddenly I'm vyká, so that's it!
In the eyes of my mind went blank, I felt the heat.
There was a surge of regret and the charges, and I knew it was the most disgusting creatures in the world, which doesn't deserve any mercy.
That by planting an incomplete report, I pointed out the mistake comrade cadre examiner, which I didn't understand why the report was incomplete when I got it from a cadre at the factory.
I also antisocialistický element, which at the time of building socialism supports the deaths of religious obscurantism, or even participate in them.
That, that, that was a lot of what I've done, or maybe even commit and I silently prayed for it to end.
I don't care.
I was one out of my place mechanizátora.
I was one, I think they'll take the pick.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not the enemy of the people, as in the eyes of the chief.
"that's enough, sir," said the President of the party, and strongly broke the chief's levity.
It has made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, the right thing to do.
But he's already got his punishment.
And don't you forget it, sir!
What could be worse for a young person, than that at the time we close the door to the side.
To be opened again, he will have to prove that he's changed, that is worthy of our trust again.
An uneducated hack talking like a book.
Where did that come from?
It's so literate or partisan parroted phrases of the training and the meetings?
That's why this young comrade must get away from us a chance!
A chance to prove that he's changed.
And who does give it to him, if not just you, sir?
It is your duty to this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade, to support his efforts to remedy.
It's your party, which you'll never be rid of it.
Actually, it's an obligation of all of us.
This is Comrade must see that side of him.
Being a good mother is not only, but also that he loves.
When the president finished, no one said a word.
Such a twist no one expected.
At least I do.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade President," Ice chief said, in an effort to regain the initiative.
If you'd let me finish, you heard that I was going to just such a conclusion.
They all nod their heads, but it was up to them to see that he doesn't believe a word of it.
"so I was confirmed for the independent examiner care about basic resources," he said when I got back to the office and then I began to cry.
Another addition to the engineers, Eve, they were all at lunch.
The silent, listening to my incoherent makeup fresh experiences and I had calmed down.
When I finished, she asked whether I'll have a cup of coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, put water on the stove and cups.
In the meantime, talking about kádrováckých practices.
How one opinion, often full of praise, give a man in the arm, and the second, in which any dirt, they will send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to, but a Sunday-afternoon picks, and comrades from the factory, didn't know where to send it to.
And our cadre?
He's just an old, where what he ate or drank, and so it turned out, as it turned out.
"it's from an old gets it," she said wryly.
Today, he won't like it.
Still, watch out for him, he's very vindictive.
And the President of the party?
In fact, far worse, no humanitarian.
Zero from the picks with great power.
The coffee was hot, and the office was filled with the smell of the coffee.
I threw a lump of sugar into a cup and mix in a hot brew.
Perhaps I'm out of the woods.
Now kick me and other reviews are for three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief me that today he won't soon forget.

A symbol of community life.
A wheel of the windmill chlumem after years of spin again.
To see them from far away, because it is located at 15 feet high, the flagpole.
People from a wide area they call him "the fan Chlum."
For the village of 150 inhabitants became one of the elements of the character that the municipality has the opportunity to rally natives in 2010.
"we have submitted to the character, and the character, of course, we wanted to have, everyone knows it," said Mayor George Masek.
Chlumské wind pump is a local technical monument.
It's a bit of a memento as well: recalls a time when the people here fought on the quality of drinking water.
The Chlum in centuries past was a rarity.
In 1910, decided to chlumští representatives for a solution that suited then until the mid 1980s.
In a village at the mouth of the cave číchov left seven meters deep well.
Three years later they were joined by a metal structure with a pump, which benefited from the water in the reservoir at the top of the village, near the church.
"the building has Anthony d out of bounds at the 2, 400 pounds of cargo," observes Memorial inscription on the construction of the fence at ground level.
The pump after a few crash repair and windmill broke down in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, he began to write a new chapter in the fight for water: on this day in a new pipe Chlum started to serve.
Wind pump have remained only a municipal symbol and a rarity here.
The work in this year's reunion natives.
When in 2008 the chlumští decided that the wind can fix bike again and again to bring into operation.
They had to build a replica of the original wheels - reduced on average by half a metre.
The bike was fitted to the mast, that same year, however, have to be put down.
The manufacturer of the reply did not choose the right material and the wheel couldn't resist the wind.
After several years of dominant Odlezelské jezero was dismantled under the roof.
From June this year, however, the bike on a tall pole is spinning again.
On the occasion of the reunion, the natives had a replica wheels edit osadila him again and again and again to the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws water from the well to overflow the blind on the shoulder.
And over the summer it was completely cut off, because there was not enough water in the well.
At least turned up empty.
"in the autumn, then shaft the windmill from pumps in the inlet off again," said Mayor Masek.
Tower isn't the only municipality in the Czech Republic, where the wind round the village character, however, is the only member of this kind in the highlands.
A similar element in the character they have in honour of the local technical monuments such as the chvalkovicích and green mountain on the vyškovsku Kuzelov on hodonínsku partutovicích on fantasies, or on the shelf at vsetínsku.
No offence, but I don't know, she admitted to rock Tripoli lafatu goian.
"the fight against match I remember very well, and my goal, as in all my career," grinned the 34-year- goian at the pre-game press conference.
Georghe Hagi trained us back then, it was too bad that we lost.
I hope I score now Sparta.
The difference is that this time, we will not, "said goian.
This is the man who has played 60 games for the Romanian national team, is a key pillar of the Greek team.
A shortstop will face raids Spartan offensive.
It comes just a few thousand people, no hell, says about the Greek duel Spartan hop.
And partly, he knows what he can expect on Thursday night.
Well I know fataie, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Luciano.
In that time, I saw all their games.
I know it's a very good striker, too, which is why he went to Sparta, said goian.
Another footballer of the Prague club name, and then came the question, if he even knows David lafatu, top scorer in the history of the Czech League and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and lightly with a reproachful look he was aiming at the Czech press.
Clueless expression on his face marked: "why are you asking me this?"
After a moment of silence, he said.
We've seen some videos and I've noticed that a lot of Sparta plays for the team.
He's got some really good players.
And lafata?
No offence, but I don't know anyone else besides fataie.
The Spartans about goianovi knows very well.
"my experience of the larger clubs, you could say that keeping defense asterasu, it's their organizer of the games," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav fool.
Goian's had the best years may be behind him, but he had a very interesting football resume.
Its time to care for him, Borussia Dortmund - Stuttgart, both Manchester United and city, from the local steauy but headed into the Italian Palermo, he played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for the aggressive, and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing The European cups, he fights for victory in the Czech League.
For me, it's the favorite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want the group to launch a good result.
Like Sparta, we try to win, said goian.
I'm in the room with the Slovak goalie Tomas košickým, which on an opponent from the Czech Republic enjoyed a lot.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can tell you that we're going to fight hard.
Coke is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, is considering entry into the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new seat should have coke in Ostrava.
Coke was registered in Poland because of the trading in shares of the company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary objective is to be the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we've taken so far in the project, are mostly legal and administrative and have no impact on what happens in society, says Daniel buryš, chief financial officer of the group coke.
"in connection with the transfer of the registered office of the group shareholders are considering the placement of the shares on the stock exchange, the Prague."
For entry to the Prague Stock Exchange the company's prospectus, which will present in the earliest days of the Czech National Bank for approval.
The transfer of the headquarters of the holding company and related share transfers will be made by means of a private transaction that they contribute only to existing shareholders.
In the context of this operation is no shares will be offered to the public or to subscribe to the new investors.

The company has previously stated that any offer of shares could be made up from the issue of new shares or sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of the supply of shares on the stock market in the Czech Republic and in Poland, including the placement of the shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
A test of objectivity in reporting on Czech Television migrantské crisis.
Another little test of objectivity and balance of the coverage of the refugee crisis, the Czech media.
This time, the main broadcast news bulletins, Czech Television.
And how did she pass?
When they are on the faculty of journalism to teach about how the media can manipulate reality, to be broadcast today, the Czech television event.
Migrantské crisis was devoted to about 80% of the news broadcasts.
Except for the first minute, when informed about the riots on Thu srbsko-maďarské border and attacks on police officers are euphemistically called migrants, they ran out of patience - they threw rocks and attacked with metal bars), driving the current promigrantská propaganda - judge for ourselves the names of individual stories.
Criticism of non-governmental organisations - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticise the bad treatment of the migrants.
Syrian children in the school - the story of the integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not just as a threat but as a chance.
Wandering refugees - Thu consistently used expressions a runner or a runaway and not a migrant.
What's striking is that she has consistently used in Thu ilustračních images and only images of small children and women.
But in the same broadcast stated that, of the migrants apprehended in the Czech Republic is 80% men.
Summary: for the most part, propaganda, which is unprecedented from communist agitek.
I have to say that, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I used to be able to place concrete building, I soon ceased to be the sole inhabitant.
The Formica in the bathroom with me roaches.
Roaches, insects with incomplete metamorphosis, i.e., neprodělávající the transition from Caterpillar to bug and the child looks like an adult, it's just a small and gradually rising.
I was disgusting and I took to it.
First manually and chemically.
Socialist drugstore at their disposal to provide a sort of blue crystals.
I think it was called Zyklon-B.
Or something else?
The break-up but it is a success.
Later, I dealt with it with the Pharaohs.
A box with a sort of juvenalizátorem, who brought the ants to the nest, and then he allowed the queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went on, I became the object of my admiration and, increasingly, I'm inclined to the view that they have the same right to life as we the people.
I also took the experience of life, that the interference with the ecosystem does not lead to success and a pest can replace the other.
True for fleas and bed bugs I would not hesitate to make things worse by killing their karma.
In the new location with a partner we agreed that if we're not roaches crawling on his neck, to sit down and eat the chips, renegade skin, some invisible eyelashes and the like.
Their quiet existence over time, the spider.
It was the usual kind of pokoutníka, who was on the ceiling.
We should consider that the lives of the occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased the comfort.
Because he had lived with us for a few years, we have found that mostly rybenkami and that their number was probably kept on únosném numerical strength.
Confidential regular contact at every need done, we discovered that it is female.
We were witnessing romantic courtship with a partner about a third less, how careful is fraying threads of spider webs, in order not to get eaten before it reaches the desired copulation.
It took about three days of moving, and even did not respond to our control.
Under the toilet bowl, where love games played, we're next to a female later found the remains of a male.
Then the long weeks, didn't move.
When we thought this is behind us, we have been surprised by the amount of small spiders, hanging around in the area.
Soon they disappeared.
The work they were eaten by the mother, the work of scattered elsewhere.
Even a week after she disappeared.
If she went somewhere else or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, popped back up on the ceiling.
True, somewhat smaller, probably the daughter of the praobyvatelky toilet.
The ceiling for some time carefully watched our behavior and movement under the toilet bowl to evaluate our Non-Aggression Pact as a friendship.
The numbers somewhat rybenek seeding to decrease again and a spider in his normal activities to ensure the food.
For a whole year to our ecosystem.
Our daughter between the age, when the use of pot was a disgrace.
So far we've tolerated it, but eternal spilling its contents to us.
We're exhorted her still more to use the toilet.
The daughter, however, found an excuse to maintain their habit in the spider, which when I see very well.
We are talking about a spider, good luck in the house didn't have.
Crying and screaming to coerce his potty.
There was no way to avoid it.
There was a moment when he had to, in the interest of the spider evolutionary shift, the boss's daughter.
It was left up to me.
He was captured in a jar and banished from the balcony into the garden.
I was saying goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt after so long living together, as if out of a relative.
We assumed that the roaches will start to emerge more often and they begin to multiply at a geometric rate.
Wonder of wonders, a week, two, wasn't there.
I began to speculate on the cause.
I was wondering if there's a spider after the model of ants, somehow, not that the toilet is not so favourable environment for their existence, as we thought.
But then there were the first pieces the size of a high school, and they were again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their loss, and I found that their link to the spider must have been the cause, when you can't see it, that it is hidden away in some other place, and that the danger to them from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some sort of telepathic contact with a predator and his sudden disappearance raised some alarm response in them.
The more that their vision no illusions.
A light show, but shyness that would respond to the waving of the hands or quick movements, it's not.
My daughter goes to the toilet on a regular basis.
I think I have a pot to piss in.
All that's left is to attract back some spider.
I've got their wish on the air, and I hope that on me after the execution on.
Otherwise we would have to use the cyclone (b.
The Ten Commandments of Albert Einstein, which enriched the world.
The statements of scientists of the last century, humanity must never cease to fascinate.
He managed to dive so deep, that has always been the product of a stunning finding.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
The awareness of the people went for his special and general theory of relativity, which describes the universe in a gigantic proportions.
Nor can we overlook his clarification fotoefektu kvantování or thought of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the very system of knowledge and hodnoty popular theory of relativity for many, it's so complex that, for the intimate acquaintance would rather opt for easy comparisons.
It's not easy, however.
Of course, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein, even if on this brilliantly found a simplified form of explanation: an hour in the vicinity of man seems just a minute; a minute in hot oven seems an hour ago - and that's relativity.
I took the liberty of all his famous quotes the choose these ten, which I was, literally.
Intelligent people are trying to solve problems, a genius is trying to do.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
In the first, I'm not so sure.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove that I was right.
However, the only time can prove that I'm wrong.
But it's a sad time, when it is easier to disintegrate an atom than a prejudice to destroy.
If the mess on the table reflects the mess in mind, then what reflects an empty desk?
I don't know what we'll be fighting in the third world war, but in the fourth it will be with sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but not how to resurrect him.
To know it's a little dangerous and know many too.
If I had had an hour to tackle the problem, that would be my life, I spent 40 minutes in his studio, 15 minutes and 5 minutes in his analysis, his solutions.
The hardest thing in the world to understand the income tax.
Finally, I cannot forbear to Einstein's formula for success: the definition of success, and taking the formula a = x + y + z, where x is y and the rest of labour, is to keep your mouth shut.
The new and modern.
The hospital waiting for a change in the view for $1.5 billion.
"it's an accomplishment, considering that this year all four holds in the black," said the captain - who was with.
The total profit of the regional facility is at this moment, about 32 million kroner.
The shares are mostly higher reimbursement from insurance companies, which are as favourable for this year.
This really shows that after a poor years, the hospital can finally afford a bigger investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherský hold and it is coming to the edifice, which together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
A long period of time, when we were shopping, mainly over.
Now we have to start to build a new building, because without them, the top health care can do, to justify plans for health care, the Regional Deputy Petr Nečas.
The changes are in all hospitals.
Clients come to hospitals next year.
Vsetín now choose the supplier of a new internal pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
In Kroměříž have scheduled an addition of dialysis.
Uherske Hradiste wants to open a central pavilion this year to build a medical, for around $200 million.
And zlínskou baťovu hospital waiting the long-delayed construction of a new central income and medical ward, which will need to be three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, it is the fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"for the region as a whole, patients and doctors, it's an extremely important step," she said, for example, to build medical vsetínské Hospital Director Vera prousková.
A five-story building there is supposed to be finished in about two years and offers comfort for medical equipment and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds, and intensive care unit.
More comfortable for patients.
The changes, which will significantly especially patients, affect all regions.
The new building will replace the ones that are, for example, many patients in the same room, on the floor, they have only one bathroom, beds are nepolohovatelné, Windows leak and paramedics do not have adequate conditions for work.
"for example, our internal was built 35 years ago, and now it's on the border of their useful life," said the Director of the hospital, while Paul Calábek.
In a few years it will replace the seven-storey modern building connected to the emergency room.
Doctors and patients will be in the same place all the acute division, especially in new areas.
The same model is already half done Uherske Hradiste.
Central's revenue within three years will be added to the medicine.
"we pay for the construction of the loan, and partly from his own resources," said Director Peter Brewer.
Was this the hospital's own funding as the only one in the country can afford.
He still has the highest profit and loss are not even two years ago, when maybe Zlínský hospital dealing with almost dvousetmilionovou loss.
"we have good contracts with insurance companies, an excellent performance, increasing revenues and effectively manage costs in the entire hospital," named vajdák - who is in charge of the economy.
The improvement will be kroměřížské hospital patients.
Within ten to fifteen years will go to repairs, new equipment, and reconstruction up to half a billion crowns.
This year, she's done the repair station, then begin rehabilitation of dialysis, or the construction of a new building for an mri.

No one explained to me how I should be adopted to keep refugees in the country, if you don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan CHOVANEC (ČSSD), after meeting with his European colleagues complain that the other States are the Czech Republic and the adoption of quotas to redistribute refugees, but any discussion.
He also points out that, so far, no one has explained how he would be allocated to refugees in the Czech Republic, when in the US just don't want to live.
"we didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted to make the quotas have been dropped from the final text," an inmate told the newspaper.
More specifically, you can describe the position that you have come to the meeting of the Ministers of the Interior and the State of the European Union?
We disagree with the mandatory quotas as a system that simply won't work.
We can't talk about migrants like bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings which have some vision, going somewhere, they got some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues, the way in which we are able to migrants on the territory of the Member States to maintain, if redistribuovali.
We can't imagine it.
We didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted to make the quotas have been dropped from the final text.
With other findings - functional hot spots, registration place, border protection, the camps outside Europe, a trust fund for the African countries and other things, we don't have any problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we say that this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Not long ago, we talked about forty thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do you keep people on that territory?
Ninety eight per cent of all the people who pass through us, wants to go to Germany.
He didn't want us to almost no one, we simply don't know how to keep them here.
We have the ambition to go to other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who, in the Czech Republic as a destination country, receiving us fireman today, but the interest of the people of this, the waves of migration from Syria and other countries, it is close to approaching zero.
You mentioned that we have refugees actually, they don't even want, but fifteen hundred people we've already committed to take.
Would it not be possible to take them in this way?
We are committed to take 1,500 people, but with the condition.
We said: the functional hot spots, border control, military operation.
In the 1500's, that's 1100 people deal with asylum procedure.
They come to our detention facility, and we will treat them the same as those that we captured.
The big question is, and that's what we're going to debate with Europe if we can detain people, who will be registered in Italy and in Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe is up to it, so that, if they can't be detained.
That means, they come to our country with the registration, and if the agreement, which is not yet, it may be that even those 1100 hold on the territory of the Czech Republic, and they're coming in again to leave Germany.
If it is we'll be able to hold them off for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will deal with them asylum procedure.
If it's the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 percent, according to European statistics, receive international protection.
Then they get the documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think that these people end up once again in the target countries.
Then there's four hundred people, who will be přesídlovat.
It is the second project, which is still there, and we're making progress in that debate with churches, the possibility that they could help them to get jobs, housing and so on.
But that's for the very long haul.
You said that at the meeting of Ministers with us the other States were not willing to discuss.
But it's not so that the Czech Republic just refused to quotas, but offers no solidarity move, which would have blocked the discussion here?
And what exactly is that supposed to be you to several step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany will cast an incentive that all migrants from Syria, they can have access to them, as the news spread in the hours after all the camps of Europe, but also in Turkey, in Jordan.
It calls for more migration wave, which is going to Germany, because the us just don't want.
We think that the protection of external borders - just you deter waves of migration, to help those in need, and to separate the economic migrants.
Definitely let them know that they don't have a chance.
Just last year, came to Germany to fifty thousand Kosovars.
From the safe of Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of the State, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor ’ s office.
If we managed to separate them, and don't accept or accept only according to the needs of the economies, so should the fifty percent of the social systems in vain for them today, they could go to the refugees.
On the first day, when Germany took control, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic.
Now it is 80 years old, the first day it was 12.
Where it does occur, to border controls tightened?
We were scared in the capture of hundreds of people.
These are numbers that we got.
We still have a few hundred vacancies in land-based detention facilities.
Of course, all the people that we hold, we'll come back in seven days.
We do this by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who these people are, with Hungary's complicated and Greeks - it's completely pointless story.
Where is the tipping point?
It would have to be a grand a day?
I think that it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two to three consecutive days, we will run out of capacity, enough contingency plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister, he would immediately called an emergency government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're several times a day in telephone contact.
If this is the situation, the government can sit down immediately and a de facto one would order decided to reinforce the police, army, customs, where applicable, management of the prison service.
The extreme option is a state of emergency, which now in some places declared Hungary?
I think it can't happen to us.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state in Europe, Schengen border we have only, and only at the airport.
I don't know, what would have to happen for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to alarm information.
All the information that we have, whether it's from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, it rather suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the flow of migration to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct trip to Austria.
The Czech Republic that would have offended very marginally, at all.
Slavia paid off at the last moment, a large part of the debt.
He's trying to avoid bankruptcy.
Football Slavia pay debts.
Their money and their players.
Football on Tuesday for the first time as Slavia insolvency proceedings before the Court of First Instance.

"everything was between September 11 and September 15, paid," stated attorney Mládková vamps.
Slavia, who paid for that?
Current and former players and business partners.
In particular, such as Czech or Slovak exreprezentantovi Milan Ivan záložníkovi Maria ličkovi.
Slavia also has paid the agent Alexander losenickemu.
On Friday the club pay the outstanding fees of Prague 10.
Part of the insolvency proceedings remain de facto only claims that the vamps.
Pursuant to the commitments of the club, not at all, or result in litigation.
However, we are prepared in the event of failure of those disputes the amount to pay.
"we have the necessary funds in the bank account, which can produce a statement of account," she told Judge Advocate Mládková.
"everything that was in arrears, it's paid for," she said, and added that Mládková unpaid are only or the disputed liabilities.
Also certain is that, in the next few days, the judge decides and the proceedings will continue.
A match for three weeks, was sent to the detailed evidence that it actually paid off the debts.
Subsequently, there will be an evaluation of all the evidence.
The decision can be expected in November, as soon as possible.
The judge ordered the continuation of negotiations on November 3.
The decision, however, she will not fall for this meeting, but after writing to him.

You could build in such a way as to not.
But it would be worth about half a billion more, says an expert from the company, which the tunnel.
Blank way was even safer, says an expert.
A tunnel complex Blanka was able to build, so there were two busts of soil in a Prague Park, says the director of the satra, which is the main tunnel designer, Alexander butovič.
He said that on Wednesday evening, during the press tour for the tunnel.
It would be, but according to him, about half a billion kroner more expensive.
Drivers will be open this Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between cost and security.
"the tunnel could make safer, but the costs are growing exponentially," said butovič.
The conditions in the park have been under him after the same thing all the time, yet the country in just a few steps from the place where he began to make safer and more careful method.
"if that was the measure used about 500 meters before the tunnel would have been about half a billion more expensive," said butovič.
Blanka tunnel during the construction fell three times.
Twice, in 2008, there was a crater in the park, in 2010, fell to the ground at the Culture Ministry in Prague 6.
According to the company ’ s Director of Metrostav George bělohlava tunnel is too expensive, he said, the EURO weekly.
The structure was the original intention of the State 17 billion kroner.

Add to that a land buyouts, technology and engineering, and similar items, it's 29 billion, which it is not from the 37 So far, said Bělohlav

But the boom in online shopping, the results strengthened the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter of the inland revenue increased by about 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger parcels and your own insurance.
The express unit recorded a higher income due to the higher rates, while profit decreased in the cargo trade because of higher prices for labour.
In předtržním trading about an hour before the opening of the company ’ s shares in FedEx fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
Ended Tuesday with a decrease of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of 11 June.
At its hottest meetings in years, Federal Reserve policymakers this week will spend two days at 27 feet long and Honduran mahogany table will determine whether, after almost ten years the time has come to increase the key interest rate.
Towering above them at one end of the Central Bank, the two-storey design conference room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The central bank has a dual charge of Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep the price stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be x-faktorem in too close to the predictable decision, to be announced on Thursday, about whether the US economy is ready to start in the decommissioning of the unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates in place since the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows solid growth of the economy, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the fed already cautious about adding to volatility by increasing its benchmark federal funds rate - and it's about nothing more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"it is clear that the labour market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"but I think they were just looking for an excuse to not hiking rates, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient reason to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed does, which in itself is the cause of the nervousness on the financial markets.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Blomberg predicted an increase in rates this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to hold off on the matter, a key indicator of only about 30% chance of an increase.
That would have pointed to a decline in the stock market, in the event that the Fed will raise rates only if politicians will fall in the promise of another increase is in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599,85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that the Fed will delay rate politicians this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's capital markets research group.
"it would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates," It states.
If it's the politicians, the Fed did, "they would have to go to great lengths in the programme Declaration and hold hands in the financial markets, not to panic."
Other experts said that the increase in rates would have calmed financial markets, because it would remove the uncertainty of how the Fed will proceed.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the Fed is on track to raise rates by 0.25 of a percentage point this month, the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions, which would confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the United States.
Yellen said that, through the spring and early summer is expected to increase rates this year, despite complaints from liberals, there is a need for more economic progress.
Even if job creation slowed in August, the job market this year, recorded solid growth.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
And even though inflation remains below the Central Bank's annual 2% target, the politicians, the Fed maintains that the main reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.
"the economy can cope with higher rates, and he needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world began to struggle at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped to a record 16% below its value in May, when investors feared that a slowing Chinese economy dragging down global growth.
The market rebounded slightly this month, and only the Dow has lost almost 10% from the peak in May.
The Fed ’ s policy makers the turbulent situation on the market, adds a complex calculus, when to start raising interest rates.
"in the absence of that, what happened in the financial markets, and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA ziman center for real estate and a former Fed official.
Now predicts that they will wait at least a month, to gain better control over the consequences.
"there's a lot of uncertainty about what impact it will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data on which they could rely on the latest developments in China," oliner said.
The health of the global economy is one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically shouldn't be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed became the monetary authority all over the world.
The impact of the central bank in recent years, there have been enormous.
The mere suggestion of the then chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013, that the Fed could "taper" its monetary expansion in the market, triggered spasms all over the world.
In a world where the markets and the economy are getting more closely intertwined, it can be expected that Fed officials also are watching developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central bankers, and experts in order to read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more of an art than a science," said Zachary karabell, head of Global Strategy for envestnet bohatství-management Company Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "the Fed has a history with exaggerated movements on the financial markets, which appear to be disconnected with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, which pushed for the increase in rates, citing the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia, has led the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points in the three meetings "identifiable, despite the limited impact on growth in the U.S.," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed ’ s leaders have turned these cuts.
The Fed should prioritise financial stability concerns only during the Great Depression, as was the market meltdown of 2008, "said Adam Posen, a former member of the board with setting rates by the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil to even come close to this level, he said.
"you don't want to be in a situation of fear from the growth rates, because the markets are upset," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.

For the baby shower in 10 years.

The police in this case to prosecute, and assemblywoman Susan kailovou (ČSSD), the House of Commons, but it did not.
According to the legal case is two to ten years in prison.
The trial is scheduled for two days in October.
According to prosecutor mandík with macíkem have caused damage to at least one million crowns, is clear of the charges.
The applicant is based on expert opinion.

The city paid off at least a million extra.
Both led the charge to ensure darothore for awarding public contracts on the staging of the baby shower in Usti nad Labem, act in a coordinated way, and in the long term at least in conflict with the requirement for the procedure, with due care, says the prosecutor.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that the company subsequently darothore after obtaining this contract be cleared of Usti nad Labem in the implementation of the action at the baby shower, which will be compared to the fair value of the services actually provided disproportionately inflated.

Mandík before any violation of the law.
No offence I didn't commit, I'm innocent.
This fabricated case I don't understand, he said, before the former mayor, with the city under his leadership, just to build a similar project from past years.
In the years 2008 to 2010 event the agency Roxy II.

Hungarian police officers allegedly released the dog.
Then forced journalists to delete the footage.
He said the police at the Hungarian border with Serbia briefly detained AP cameraman and forced him to delete the recording, on which a police dog allegedly knocked to the ground.
The Hungarian Government but denies this charge.
The alleged incident happened Saturday night, when the AP cameraman filming, Luca Muzi, migrants across a field of corn near the Hungarian town of Röszke crossing the border with Serbia.
Against the refugees in the police, and one of them left a Syrian attack dog with a basket on the nose.
The dog, a man who was shouting "please, please, please, please, I'm a runner," and he says men.
That man all filming, he noticed one of the police officers and wouldn't let him leave.
A journalist, then you could even make a phone call to his superiors, nor his colleagues on the spot.
The officers were taken to a dark place muziho at registration centres for refugees and asked him to show them what is recorded.
Then ordered him to erase the footage.
The men came as the result of a two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger, because they were dogs.
The AP sent a letter of protest, the Hungarian government spokesman zoltánu Kovács.
Police identified him as unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover the events, without risk of physical violence, and we won't have to worry that the government will destroy the material obtained legally.
Kovács, referring to a police report muziho account of events questioned.
He said that the police just wanted to be a journalist, whether they are in some of the footage, which they say they have the right to.
When they found out that they are not there, it's nothing.
"dogs may bark - they are trained to odstrašovali and a little fierce, but not with certainty," says Kovacs.
Unpredictable the Champions League.
A win for city will kick us, believes Juventus
"it's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of the city.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic game of the Champions League.
Neither team created a lot of chances, but the football boots the ball we had longer.
"the cause of the failure wasn't in the game, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals a game," said Pellegrini, whose team in a competitive match after long 636 minutes.
Last season's runner-up Juventus in front of mutual encounter exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, as the defending champion only point and with the score 2: 4 is up to 16th place in the table.
And that's why he was turnover at the Etihad stadium.
"this win will help us mentally, kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Mestre, which it had been before the New Year to deal with the loss of three pillars - Italy, téveze and Vidal.
In Manchester it's blocking pogba, mandžukič and Morata.
"it's so, this victory is very important, perhaps thanks to him we're going on a winning wave," hoping to show.
Because when we're on it, among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the offensive phase.
This is the result of my players deserve.
"balancing our goal we could on the contrary cash at 0: 2, but (No hold us up," said coach buffona goalie Mestre.
"we burned a few good chances," sorry Yayu tourého, midfield city.
We need to take the experience of the Champions League and, next time, try to get a better result.
Goodbye, farewell to the old Germany II.
Before we go on about immigrants, we should remember that all the media frenzy around is managed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media, and also from the top.
And so, let us pause for a moment.
Today they are the newspapers and the media full of babies, which are at the hands of their parents after the dusty roads of the exodus.
And that raises in a man - in the European man - automatic guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't come here just desperate children, notice the footage of their boats to the Greek islands, babies on them so much to see!
Well, the last time us somehow disappeared from the TV pictures of ships heading to lampedusu, refugees from the French border near Menton, whose beautiful promenade of thousands of young men.
A large part of the young black men.
And also the pictures from Calais, where these brown and black men are waiting, if they manage to get through the tunnel under the English Channel.
I think it doesn't.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian Church Eritreans didn't do anything special for the people of Europe.
Much of it was disproved.
So when it comes to the quota for refugees, somehow, that it's not just the poor little children from Syria, but also about the styling - for older: vyfešákované fashionably - young men.
Whose muscles look like they've just climbed out of a gym.
Just one personal experience.
This summer, the Turkish Muslim - part of Cyprus, we were on the private beach of the hotel.
No matter that it was a private, arrived at the beach, a large group of cars.
But no ham.
And one of them got out young black men.
About 30 men and five women.
The age of between 15 and 30 years ago.
They went to the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes in hand, of course, smartphones.
It's a private beach, is the care and staff - the Turks, Muslims - they are obviously worried.
Occupied all the deckchairs.
Who was on him and he was in the sea, he was out of luck.
They were dressed like American rapperského movie.
On their heads with hats, white and colored Adidas shoes on his feet.
Then the local beach bar and feasting.
The tables around, stuff sitting next to brown and white guests bar - Read it Muslims and Europeans, without being asked.
Mothers with children, fleeing the dining terrace somewhere in peace.
Incoming Indians drink beer straight from the třetinek - as in the series, from the USA?! - on the beach, they threw empty bottles around.
Constantly shouting loudly at each other.
In English, of course, it was.
Then they also drink wine straight from the bottle.
They jumped into a hotel swimming pool in a bathing suit, particularly the young ladies, in the water and screamed and screamed, mothers with children and pensioners ran away and half an hour later, he was on the beach or in a swimming pool or one nečerný guest.
They all disappeared.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff are worried about them and just talk.
The waiter in the evening he said: "you saw it, what they were wearing?"
"yeah," I said.
"well, it certainly wouldn't work," said the waiter.
I thought: "I know, I know, they all had a massive gold chains around their necks.
And the one he had on his neck, like a massive cross of gold.
And the women were like a jewelry store.
"these are drug traffickers?" I asked.
"well, you saw how drinking," the waiter said.
Party drugs, or not.
They tell you something completely different.
So, it was clear to me what they were smuggling.
However, in the June 2105 still for me, it wasn't so important.
I had no idea what would follow.
But the Secret Service and top politicians ought to be the first to know.
I don't think they didn't know.
In Europe at the time, has about 1.5 million immigrants.
And they go and they come and they go.
Now it turns out that the main problem of the European Union, is that politicians, like totalitně-politicko-korektní intellectuals and attached them to the lobbying and economically important groups in Europe have the greatest power.
Germany and its politicians now publicly accepted the main power in Europe - they lie, lie and lie - but they're not the only ones, the leaders of the EU and the TV, including our own.
For example, the recent television images of excited about welcoming refugees in Germany are at the level of the Moscow TV images from August 1968.
Of course, the station was a few sluníčkářů, but mainly - staroněmečtí - Muslims greeted his fellow countrymen.
The long weeks of blather on the news on Czech Television, how they are, according to some research, almost all Germans for the arrival of immigrants.
Of course, who was only a few days in Germany, he knows it's a lie.
Which confirm other information.
For example, the famous poll organized Ard - the Czech Association of public television companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to Ard wanted a week ago, more than 50% of the Germans to accept more refugees.
It also meldovaly our TV.
Of course, the next day, snapped in Germany: the right to vote in anketním Article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want immigrants - participated in the survey, 67 000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, five years ago, said: "our efforts to ́multi-kulti ́společnost totally failed."
Then she said: "Germany has given up the fight on a multicultural society."
"any attempt to live a totally failed."
In a country where there are four million Muslims, the strategy didn't work, that people from different cultural environments to live next door to each other, without having to integrate live here with us today, and we have some time to ourselves, one day they will disappear again.
But that's not the reality.
A multicultural approach where we say we just live happily side by side, so this approach has failed.
Completely failed.
But even Merkel probably doesn't have the strength to go against the mighty Germany, Europe and especially against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euroněmec Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, Member of Parliament for the SPD in Parliament ’ s, the one who allegedly doesn't even have a high school diploma - yes, that's the one Berlusconi in the EU Parliament, said that he could play the guard in a concentration camp, as he demonstrated again.
It seems, especially under the impression the last statements of German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
It should be noted that, to some, the majority of European politicians, statesmen, to support those countries that were victims of Nazism, are aghast.
What's happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who tried for years, at least outwardly, to cope with his terrible past, aggressor and killer of millions?
They are right, who say that, in the spirit of the devil to be Germany's aggression, condescension and violence?
He was right the Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, when all of his strength to stop velkoněmců controlling the middle of Europe?
When he said that the idea of the great German Germany destroy?
Probably should have.
When it shut down, she began preparing for the first world war.
The idea of velkoněmecka, who led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably in a different form.
After attempting to control the state, for example, we weren't, and after the failure of the GDR, in Germany for example, ecology, which, by the way, was one of the main forces of Nazism, began to develop the new German ideology.
We'd say well Sunny.
The German elites have long prevented the emergence of German nationalism, and so left alone all these fighters against an atom, enthusiasts looking for Paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi password our forest must live.
To satisfy restless young people all over the world want to do something different, and better, to fully side with the warriors against the warming of the planet, nuclear power plants, etc.
And that, in this way, there is also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called antislovanský propalestinský - and the power of all the Slavs, difficult thing - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after Parents, a Jew, was mainly German Nationalist.
And also, as shown by the latest statements by Schulz and German minstrů openly defying threatening the eastern states, the idea of a German leader.
That is without the need to obey.
Otherwise woe betide you!
And if we bring that immigrants are very impressionable group of voters, we have what we have.
And it is, as always, the capital, in particular, the German who is comfortable and who benefit from it, despite the fact that Germany is the bank and Union control most of the States of Europe.
Pseudovíra sluníčkářů first introduced the Germans into the swamp and ekologismu multiklturalismu and bring them home and bring the maybe millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by the siren voices, soon hit the wall of reality, which Merkel wants to see, and they begin to rebel.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbors by force, again, may be part of its population - but, it seems, still less part of the mind gets addled - ideologically, but in the end, he, as always, reality catches up with you.
Germany will burn again?
Muslim quarters already burning.
What does the German government to launch a public protest of the Germans against the incoming Islamists?
Who will come to the aid of Muslims already living in Germany for a long time, but certainly not asimilovaní, to local customs and laws?
What does the German Government, when they let the hyphenated Muslims, Islamo-Fascists, and watching the incoming Germans fear Islamisation of their country?
What does that do to the Germans, and even with Germany, when you pick up people who will loudly and publicly to protest against a new Muslim euro-nadčlověku?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict, which triggered in Europe by promoting sluníčkářské ideology, ideology, elitist and, in principle, the totalitarian, and their greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the omission of democratic defying the Germans and all the underprivileged and the rebellious Eastern neighbours it can't turn out well.
Completion of tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the pushy salesmen: scare them to death.
Just knock and robust knocker on your lashes out in a way that the weaker nature doesn't just stand.
Animated title you off and make even hardened, on the way out (or take away) and the seller of a living sculpture.
A pity, perhaps, that the speaker cannot get in real life.
And the US would be good for staving off a lot of minds and scumbags.
Common růžkatý (OXALIS corniculata).
Retail weed, which tolerate dry environment.
And so is located between the outdoor tiles near my place of residence.
On 16 September 2015 was photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to the expansion of weeds, but visually creates a good impression, as regards the flowering stage.
Among the outdoor tiles is located.
It's unpredictable, it is in our backyard.
He's like a drier environment, it is easily adaptable, humble and low-maintenance.
Creates the leaves with a chaotic composition, but it's worth it to watch and take photos.
Under the microscope is the only beauty detail - the yellow flowers and green leaves with purple.
Brazilian paediatric society Rio Grande, promoting a healthy diet during lactation
Brazilian paediatric sprs company came up with a shocking way to try to convey the information to women about the importance of a good diet when breastfeeding breasts by images of children suckling from vymalovaného depiction of junk food.
Human breast milk is made up of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide infants all the nutrients that they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to an excess of energy requirements is for pregnant women and first-time mothers increase the recommended daily caloric intake by 500 calories a day.
However, the new research suggests that an increase in calorie intake is not the only diet that mothers should drive.
A recent study by Robert waterlandem, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet of pregnant women, in fact, influenced the genetic development of their children and protect them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, he also confirmed that the unhealthy diets negatively affect a child's immune system.
Seven's sunrise dominates the rates, while nine's was trying to take the lead on the today show.
Running stefanovice Karl and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to cover the cost of the consequences of the leak of the Liberal leadership failed to create a sufficient increase in evaluations for today.
The morning show nine projected from the national capital after Malcolm Turnbull toppled Tony Abbott.
Rival sunrise host David Koch and Samantha armytage is stuck in London as part of a week long series of international broadcasters, which also includes Dubai, New York, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.

At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40 000 and 50 000.
In September, sunrise has an average of 349 000 spectators and yet today 314 000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The changes affect the winds this morning more than Parliament, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

Mr. dhakal contends that the police used tear gas and fired into the air, before resorting to a rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, States.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused by the high number of deaths.
The clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the ethnic madhesi groups say they have set up a new Province under the proposed new constitution, and lessen their political influence.
Further demonstrations have also been reported in western Nepal ethnic group of tharus, which calls for the creation of their own State.

Lawmakers this week in Kathmandu to vote for the provisions of the draft Constitution, and officials noted that the new Charter should be taken into Sunday.
Certainly, right now we can't panic.
After the loss of the ice master Litvinova, you couldn't even domestic duel with hockey players of Sparta (3: 5).

For the slightly obese diabetics could be a useful weight loss surgery
The benefits of weight-loss surgery for obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to tell whether the mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes are living longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"mortality data maintain the view for a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study JAMA surgery.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgery to reduce his stomach using different methods.
Reduce hunger and the limitations of the human body absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was carried out on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal in terms of between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher suggests overweight person and people with a value of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
For their new study, the researchers used the min-sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data gathered from a study from 2007, which deals with the two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and a gastrectomy - in medical treatments type 3 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery, according to the study, fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
In the meantime, the BMI of those who have been given the surgical treatment of diabetes, roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with diabetes were resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the drug treatment group was compared to diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and only partially for about 2 percent of patients.
There was also blood pressure control, trigylceridů and "bad" LDL cholesterol demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient hemoglobin a1c levels in the blood, which reflects the continuous blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, noted the researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c value dropped from about 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the group treated with medication, however, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this "better glycaemic control" - reflected in improved levels of hemoglobin A1c -- to reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. chih-cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the group a gastrectomy (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), has achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and had a greater likelihood of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent to 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not improve survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from studies of people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona College of medicine-phoenix.
According to the Swedish study were obese people who underwent bariatric surgery, about 29 percent greater chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to the group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone's soothing outcome for people with a BMI of under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"this work is critical, because it suggests that surgery is safer in the group with a lower BMI," without an increase in the risk of death or kidney disease, States.
Blackstone also maintains that the people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after the decline in patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long with it, we make it very clear to people that the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once the accumulation of these genetic changes, which firmly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is really difficult.
"it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe is not able to accommodate all of the refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader, called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama has addressed the question of the ongoing refugee crisis in his acceptance speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama centre for compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that under the current circumstances, the interest of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
Also pointed out that the answer from western European countries, whether it was in any way admirable, the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the effort of Germany and Austria in the resolution, stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"to take care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you'll have to think about the long term solution, a way to bring real peace and real development, in particular through the education of the Muslim countries," he pointed out.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force will never solve these problems, "he added.
In addressing issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also expressed the actions of George Bush after the 9 / 11 terrorist attack, and claim that "violent U.S. reaction triggered the chain of events.
After 9 / 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the way to solve this problem, not the violent path.
I know that his motives were good, but he used his strength to create unexpected consequences, "the Dalai Lama said.

In 2013, the two women are from Ontario after swallowing the sanitation of the device, which contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.

Why, I was witness to executions in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I'll watch the killing of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't come to that, I'll sit in the viewing gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary's death chamber and see Richard glossipa, who is to be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me if I was one of the four officials, who will be the witnesses to his death.
As soon as I received the invitation in January over his best friend, and even though I was so shocked, I agreed.
The day is coming, I'm starting to get worried.
Why do it then?
I accepted the invitation, because I think it's a good way to me, how am I going to be able to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
They offered me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because it is often more applications than positions, the morbid lottery that will decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, it will be to watch the execution.
I can't do it.
I'll sit side by side with his closest friends, Richard glossipa and I made him a special bond through months of phone calls, and one of the two and a half hour visit.
I like this guy.
Often when we talk to each other.
The prison, the administration argues that it can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notebook, and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, I'm compromising his impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story the way he would like that, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "it could be better," but still thinks, that's what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if it did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him that I may at any time remove from the witness list.
But he wants the international journalists, who will be on the spot ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help practices against the death penalty.
Kim bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, it will be by my side.
If you want to know more information about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts, which I created.
I won't be here again all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van treese would make him guilty of being an accessory to the crime.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that the murder of an innocent man.
I absolutely believe that it had not provided sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, it's bad execution.
And from this perspective, I will follow his death.
I can't say that I'll be really objective.
For this purpose, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is to experience what it's like to see a man I like, to die a meaningless death.

Peter Moody says organisers tried to spy on him and at the end of the race
Peter Moody accused organisers of racing Victoria, that he tried to get a spy into the stable last year and immediately threatened to end the race.
He focused on the stewards and the integrity Department of racing Victoria, and based on the belief that they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratch of Lady tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which for him on Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax media that he was always trying to do what is best for racing and he found himself in a difficult situation, as regards the lidarin positive swab to cobalt, which he can't explain.
He bit his tongue on charges of espionage over a period of 18 months, and he didn't want it to look like a "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about the fact that I'm sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it comes out of you, everything all at once," said Moody.
They know that it went on.
Sometimes react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'm going to have to live with what I said.
Today, I'm going to go home and get a good night's sleep.
I want to go out with his head up and to the owners thought they were doing the best for them.
If they think otherwise, then I shouldn't be the coach.
I would then have to consider what I'll be doing my licences.
Earlier in the interview, Moody out for racing.com bomb that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dale brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man whom I will call the question - and offered him a job in my stables for it, to find out information about things that are in my stables," Moody said on racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's so, they should show all of your information, because in order to catch me completely failed.
Robert roulston, former RVL Chairman David Moodie, the current President of the Ni, and Bernard saundry, the current general director of RVL, at that time, were aware, and are aware of it even today.
I should think that it becomes the personal issues?
Keep the RVL grow some balls and take people out of the coaches' positions they took responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
I'm all for this industry is bad?
I'm just really, really bad for the industry?
Maybe the people here think that it does.
Maybe I need to get my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them stuff to think about.
But it got to the point now that it doesn't matter to me, and I'm really sad.
I'm really sad.
I'll push them and carry the burden on them to make a decision.
I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.

Mood, most famous for the preparation of the undefeated champion black caviar, as a rule the day in the race for the "ridiculous" after he was injected on the horse a clay or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
One of my team accidentally smeared on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday and it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treatment the tiling in the day of the race, which the organisers have already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.

Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back rivals for wrestling claim
Melbourne storm coach, Craig Bellamy, critical of the actions of his players as "agenda setting" two NRL premiership favourites.
Sydney roosters coach, Trent Robinson, he said, that the referee allowed the players storm "wrestlovat" his players during the controversial victory team storm in the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennett, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, he made a slightly veiled comment on the Strorm after his team won the final qualification over the North Queensland cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game a "parade" rugby league and, according to him, two of Queensland were "too big" to a wrestling match.
Bellamy surgeries defended his players and said that the focus on "contact."
Bellamy added that the situation increased confidence, because his team has been criticised by two leading trainers, which may mean that they have the fear of defeat from the storm.
"it still is - I don't remember that Trent Robinson spoke of the wrestling, when they beat us," he said on Wednesday, 24-2, Bellamy.
I can guarantee you that we are in the last year they haven't changed anything from our defensive system and techniques, the last couple of weeks we only put the emphasis on contact during the crackdown, and that meant to us.
Trent's here for three years and it's obviously a great team, so it's probably not used to losing, which for him might be a bit of a shock.
It's funny how these things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy discard the idea of Bennett's "exciting football" and reminded his mentor, bennetovův st george-illawarra dragons team that won the premiership in 2010, playing "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about the exciting football.
He was right in that it was the Saturday game as exciting as ours, it was also just as exciting, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George's were criticized for the fact that they were boring team and Wayne said that that didn't matter to him.
But now he has a team that can play the style of play, which seems the cancellation, particularly his young quarterbacks with their speed.
That kind of football you want to play, if you have access to this type of players.
This opinion in 2010, and now he wants everyone to teams playing his style of football - but not every team has two linebackers such as Anthony Milford and Ben hunt, so that's the style they play.
It makes me more confident, because they say those things, because they are worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, the US probably haven't even thought of, when getting to the big matches.
Bellamy also pointed out that in the storm and roosters fell more goals than in the game, the Broncos and the cowboys.
A game the Broncos team was likely to be good, I haven't checked, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game is up 20-18, in our game, there were two more attempts, but it's exciting football?
Or are the breaks and neskórování attempts that interesting?
I think it's agenda.
If you refer to the US, that means that at some stage we'll meet again.
Storm this weekend, have a break and won the right to host either North Queensland or cronulla sharks cownboys in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park, tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.
The serbian man who won $200,000 bail on drug charges
The man, who had faced a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine, which was smuggled out of Queensland, he got bail USD 200 000.

"after reading the affidavits of persons, it is clear that the $200,000 bail for them is a real financial burden," said the judge, Flanagan.
Their effort itself was manifestly inadequate, because it did not appear in court, the accused, he warned.
Maksimovicovi was granted bail on condition that he surrenders as Australian, Serbian passport, report to police daily and adhere to a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

Arsenal Captain Mikel arteta says team must get behind the injured Jack wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also pointed out for wilshere, it's still only September, and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason for him to play again at Christmas.
The best scenario is that wilshere would miss at least the next four games and, from the point of view of English history, his involvement in next summer's European Championships, is obviously uncertain.
A great pity this nnejnovějšího problem is that wilshere finished strong last season after an ankle injury and then back into the former předsezóny form.
"this kind of injury does not jeopardise his career," says Wenger.
It's a wound that needs healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't even his ankle injury, which he suffered before.
It could be from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger has admitted that there is a risk of further injury, whenever any player returns during the season.
Here, too, there is a pattern.
A survey carried out by Premier injuries Ltd recorded 23 different injuries wilshera since six years ago, he had his video game Debut.
During the last five years, he played in only 65 league matches, the arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a wider perspective for arsenal that means that, in six out of eight seasons from 2007-08 was one of two clubs in the Premier League, which lost the most days because of the injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that improvements in recorded injuries during last season will continue.
"sometimes, when you're coming back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the competition," says Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body is stabilizing, I'm sure he does, and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal's campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against the Dinamo Zagreb game with Chelsea on Saturday, and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger prepares to rotate his team.
Héctor bellerín, Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, it means that Mathieu debuchy and arteta will probably.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier giroudem instead of nacho monreala Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain a balance and have players who need a break," says Wenger.
Even if Arsenal is clear favourite to progress from Group F in the maksimir, Zagreb's reputation as the most intimidating Stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also defeated in a total of 41 games, after last season, keep the campaign "invincible".
The stadium on Wednesday night, the earthquake shook the 3.2 degrees of Richter.
It was in Zagreb for the tenth time this year.
Wenger thinks that arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League, when capitulated against Monaco and he remains a distant hope, to lead the club to a first victory in the European Cup.
"this deployment is huge," says Wenger.
Arsenal, it never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
Friendsfest: comedy show, which gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The lack of a similar view in different show is striking, especially given the need for men to open up to more desperate than ever, as far as suicides among young men in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the biggest single cause of death for men aged 20-45 years in Great Britain and is three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address this problem, the campaign against living miserably (calm) year 2015 as the year of the man, whose aim is to challenge the culture that prevents men seek help in case of need.
At the heart of this fight is friendship for meeting this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students reporting symptoms of depression found that, in the event that the victim had a high enough percentage of friends with "a healthy attitude," their chances of recovery has doubled.
As for those who are not depressed, constitutes the circle mentally healthy friends half a chance on the incidence of mental health problems.
But to make the friendship work, must of course be available as soon as possible.
In that communication via social media, with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the Communication, the immediate response is often preferable to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives has doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even if we are in reality more isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call the external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values, our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And how long ago he explained one billionaire and creator of the games, the more money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of the show friends was for him a source of this idea.
None of the figures weren't defined by their work, but their personalities shone through friendly interactions.
Joey and Chandler's frequent victims, while watching football on comfy chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that, yes, men can also identify with it, even if most of them keep their feelings for each other.
I'm a kindly worker explained:... "my role as an audience of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interaction can make a difference."
The men who contact us, often feel an inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about the problems.
Friends are one of the shows, which will come to my mind when I'm trying to offer longer-term compensation mechanism.
The small moments in a man's friendship.
As for my task, an outsider on the telephone, to help people in moments of despair, but long-term aid must come from a close network of friends and family.
So if you're going on this weekend frendsfest hosted by comedy central station, why not take your friends for a drink in the Central Perk, where will the interior to celebrate the completely rewritten.
Or if you see someone alone in a Starbucks, just smile and say hello to him.
You never know what difference it can make to your friendship.
"friends" will be broadcast on comedy central station from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for the # friendsfest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel di Maria celebrates with Charlotte and matuidim edinsonem cavanim run after goal against malmu.
Angel di Maria scored in his debut in the Champions League and so helped PSG on Tuesday to defeat the Swedish team Malmo.
Here's the report on the game, and the response to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain started his journey in the Champions League final comfortable victory 2-0 against malmu at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after their debut in the Champions League and the player sent the French Champions PSG to victory, but then dropped a couple of chances, and finally upped their lead when Cavani scored his goal in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the team Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, not just focusing on the skills to the elimination rounds, but to improve their road to the quarter-finals, which recorded in each of the previous three years.
But even if you get three points, it wasn't a classic performance team of Laurent Blanc and Gilden ibrahimovic was lavish in front of the net and was later replaced by against his home team and the club, in which he started his infamous career in 1999.
"in the Champions League is not easy to win out or at home, so a win makes our opponents problems up 2-0 and look comfortable in defence is a good start, even if there are things that we're going to have to improve over the season," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we have won, but I regret that we nevstřelili about one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of three changes in the team, PSG, who took home this weekend draw 2-2 with Bordeaux in League 1, but he was in the fourth minute by di Maria.
The Argentine wing has been identified as a man who moves the PSG in Europe to a new level after his move from Manchester United, which took place last month, and he showed why, when he ran on a pass to Marcus verrattiho for defense Malm and sent a beautiful ball for the backs Johan wilanda into the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone was expecting it to start up a big victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in the play-offs, and got to this stage, with returned 9 International in the starting lineup and five defenders and their two reservists were tough.
But in addition to the missiles, Nikola djurdjice, which just missed the far corner of the goal in the 34th minute Kevin Trapp, it didn't offer much in attack.
Instead, PSG were themselves benefit from bad to miserable přihrávkami and that wasn't good even from ibrahimovice, who couldn't even shot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed, because his shot hit the net shortly after the start of the second half Cavani.
However, he showed a much more appropriate, when it came to the preparation of the chances for his teammates, and it was from his pass, when di Maria sent missile drill, which ended in wilandově goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of the game thanks to this cavanimu, the Uruguayan heading over the line in the sixth goal of the season after ibrahimovic scored after a pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
That ended any thoughts about the possibility of Malm, that they could get something from the game, and only a superb save from a great wilanda near dashed the hopes of David Luiz and the score remained unchanged even when the goal was střídajícího Ezequiel lavezziho at the end of the game and unacceptable.
Malmö coach age hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, nor stated: "our last game in the Champions League took place in December of last year."
Since then, we've only played Swedish League, which is not on the same level.
The qualifying matches is not good enough.
Hats off to Paris.
For them, it was a fascinating game.

As the refugee crisis ripped through the Schengen area.
An emergency beacon was launched from Germany nestmelila European crew, but he forced the ship to change course, he wrote to the French newspaper Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the problem of refugees: will more likely be systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as soon as he sets foot on the old continent of Europe - in particular Greece, than to argue for the sake of future distribution of refugees According to quotas on the basis of quantity, which increasingly away from reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said 25 of the 28 countries of the EU, to be reallocated 160 thousand refugees, they changed the interior ministers of the Member States.
Before worrying about the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who are arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already inside the Schengen area.
"the effective management of the external borders of the EU is necessary for managing migration," points out in the text, the Ministers discussed Monday in Brussels.
After the crisis, the EU is a common currency that is at risk in his next big integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but does not lose her determination, and increases the pressure.
Restoring border controls, in particular with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those who seek asylum in this country.
Central power that makes it clear that, without it, there is no freedom of movement in Europe.
It would serve as proof that Austria and Slovakia on Monday to this measure.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and even France are thinking about it, too, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary that was a long time ago.
This exceptional and temporary measures are allowed under Schengen rules.
That's a domino effect, but even a blind man can see.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, in the south of Italy and also in Hungary, for those who have already passed into the interior.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague, Thomas de Maizière about intensely acted during a private conversation with three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is tough.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics were already registered and identified with taking fingerprints of two thirds of the newly arrived refugees.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any point of entry to its territory, because they fear more than the others, so on her shoulders, left the camps in which the refugees massed on its behalf.
True, Greece remains a black hole.
On its islands near the Turkish coast landed this year, more than 200,000 people, which is more than twice what arrived recently in Italy.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria, after passing through the crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge, gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil and they are waiting for a new government, his hands folded in his lap.
That's the starting point for the Balkan route and the source of the now common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán ’ s.
JUNCKER the Commission promises to introduce control points there as soon as possible, but did not indicate any number or a date.
"the challenges that Greece faces, apply to the whole of Europe," agreed on Monday, European Union Interior Ministers on the mobilization on this front.
Therefore, it is in this country, to deploy teams of the European border control agency, Frontex.
The EU wants to help Greece to extend its capacity for reception of asylum seekers and to strengthen oversight of the islands.
"it will require adequate financial resources," warns the text submitted to Ministers for approval.
From the point of view of the law will continue to have the last word in Athens.
The real question of the creation of European border guards had not been officially filed, but Europe a close second.
The new emergency 'as well, on the question of mandatory quotas and 160 thousand of refugees, which at the beginning of the year has Juncker for the Commission and the European Parliament, and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They regard it as an attack on its sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, on Monday was maintained in the text approved most of the time '.
But as a political liability.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only solid promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, on which agreement has been reached in June during a summit of the EU, Le Figaro.

Staff at the outset, the main stage of the competition will welcome a finalist of 2011 Braga, and the coach said he wants to force his game style.
After all the nerves in the preliminary fights, when every goal and every situation you could take out on the way to the dream of the group, now we're there and we're going to play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about any of the eventual goal, you can play your tactics and are not bound by a mere dvojzápasem.
"I'm looking forward to it and it's a real Europe, before it was only the qualification," said Trpisovsky at a press conference.
Braga is considered a top team.
It will be very active, they have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
Rival just might be difficult and that it has a name like that, but in his cadre is a player who I think Manchester was three goals.
"it's a very good unit at the level of the top teams," said Trpisovsky.
For a clear favorite, but Braga.
I take it that we're playing at home, so we're definitely the underdogs.
"I think we're in the domestic competition in the preliminary rounds, to show that we're on our stadium, and we want it to be strong," said the coach, whose team lost one of the 11 duels this season to start in the Super Bowl.
He believes that he can impose his Braga, Liberec style.
We have a team that will be strong on the ball, it is also uncharacteristically disciplined for them.
They play 4-4-2 with the deployment of a rapid shift in the offensive phase.
"it's a very tough opponent, weaknesses are discovered, but the most important is how our players do on the field," said Trpisovsky.
In the preliminary rounds, we studied a lot of opponents, which is very helpful, but this time we want to focus on our game, which is what we are adapted to the practice.
"and certainly we want, even if it will be very difficult to play our music," added the coach.
