When an emergency call the professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend
During the calls to the emergency line to his voice Professor Shannon lamb admitted to police that he shot his girlfriend, and it is necessary to come to their home.
Lamb himself, that his "sweet little dog" house was alive and probably upset, and that the contacts on the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on the White Paper: "I'm so sorry, and I wish I could take it back, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," said the letter signed by Lamb, who, according to authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would he go 300 miles on a school campus, where police believe he shot favorite professor Ethan Schmidt in the door of his office.
The police chief in Delta State University Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
Lamb said the fateful phone call the emergency line shortly after.
Eventually she came another death; lamb took his own life when police came for him.
The day after the school shooting, students and the faculty, forced to hide behind locked doors, the responsible authority is still trying to figure out what was the lamb's motivation.
The details, released by investigators on the side of the State and the students and staff who knew him, and together they created the image of a talented, but probably a troubled teacher.
Students have confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt himself included lamb into the book, which he wrote, in a thank-you "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and history, together with the other 17 members of the faculty, and many students took classes with both at once.
At the same time, inclination occurred regarding the problems.
A student who extolled the lamb, Brandon beavers, said he also sounded agitated and shaky, "as if there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that it is faced with stress at the end of the academic year HWC 2014-15.
Lamb has previously applied for Delta state university for some time off for health reasons, when it stated that he has a problem.
And this year only taught two online courses.
The recent changes regarding the recruitment of University meant that a Phd on which lamb worked hard, he would be guaranteed automatic term to become assistant professor.
University President William LaForge stated that he knew of no conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. lamb obviously worried about something."
To answer these questions we have lamb.
After he left the campus, the police caught his foot when he crossed the border of the State of Arkansas back into misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, the lamb killed jedinýmvýstřelem pistol in the courtyard of the house about a mile from his parents on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington State confirmed the coroner, methel Johnson.
A car left running outside on the street.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went into this house, although Johnson said that she probably knew the people who lived there.
Lamb in this country grew up.
Lamb started work at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of training.
In the spring, he got a doctorate in education.
One of the long friends lamb described him as a bright, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston indicated that she was 15 and 20 lamb, when they met through mutual friends.
She was with friends in high school and he was this great older boy who tutored her for a few years playing guitar.
It was a heartbreaker.
The heart of all the girls softened as soon as he appeared, "said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in a suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss allegedly went together for some time.
During the emergency call, Lamb said: "I killed my wife," but the record of marriage never existed.
Had a dog named lightning, who lived with them in a brick house, which adjoins the cutoff Gautier.
Police said that the dog was fine.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O ’ Steen, said that broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends and they had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"she was completely collapsed," said O ’ Steen about his daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
O ’ Steen said he met with lamb, but through my daughter Abigail to know that lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met with prentiss, When together with Abigail vystuopovali at a summer festival three years ago.
Later played together random gigy.
O ’ Steen said his daughter writes and sings his own music.
Prentiss, the nurse who was working for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender, and occasional entertainment coordinator in the julep room, a dimly lighted bar near Gautier, said he last saw lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, sweat, what lamb played guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"he was just a happy couple," he said.
We fooled around on each other and were a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humour.
Schmidt, killed a professor, led a seminar in the first year, and specialized in Native American and a colonial history, Don said Allan Mitchell, professor of English at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the student government boys' club and students.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night with about 900 people, including members of the faculty, staff, students and members of the Community, took part in the consultation events with candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt vigílie also attended, during which the University choir sang "bright morning star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, the school started again.
"we're trying to get our students back," says La Forge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Girl herself for the Associated Press, Emily wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story has been amended to reflect the fact that the police are now saying that the lamb did call the emergency line after killing Schmidt, and although Lamb called Prentiss, his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.

8 electoral numbers, which show that Donald Trump in real light
Some were trying to identify a man who often views change.
Others waved above as a joke.
And some are preparing for the implosion.
But some Republicans Donald Trump trying to pull down from the top of the elections, they're not (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead for a two-digit number, and some people are really starting to question what it means for nomination chances of this real estate tycoon.
Of course it's still only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of the year 2011 Rick Perry did lead the way for the rise of Herman Cain, in the end, neither of them did not win a single position in the nominating process.
There are many reasons why they might encounter in the general election.
But external groups like Jeb Bush's super PAC and economic conservative group club for growth are aware trumpovu will endure and began unloading its dollars on hold in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent poll numbers, which suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
The evaluation trumpovo turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, monmouth university poll showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnate.
In mid-July it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
He now has six of the 10 Republicans to take a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are in the early stages.
After the vote, quinnipiac University, which took place last week, found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Donald Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN / ORC poll, which was conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans indicated they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" with Donald Trump as a candidate.
Only two of the 10 reported that they were "outraged" of his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as trump (43 percent of people said that they would be "enthusiastic" against 40 percent who say the same of Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if the front-runner Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans see Trump as a temper problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for its bombast and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide is receptive to the idea that the real estate magnate has the right temperament for the presidency, according to the Monday vote ABC News / Washington Post.
The same number are holding senatorial club in the State of Iowa, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality of a leader, according to quinnipiac from last week.
Yet 44 percent think he has the personality to serve effectively, and almost six out of 10 independent says his temperament does not belong to the White House, according to ABC / post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
Putting on his učenecké hats, Republican voters think Trump is the real candidate.
The question of who most likely will win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was the best choice, according to the CNN / ORC poll from last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters in the past, shouldn't the brightest crystal ball.
At this time last cycle you 4 out of 10 Republicans selected as the winner of a Rick Perry candidacy against 28 percent for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.
Yet, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump as a credible campaign.
Even when Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everybody.
Some scholars point out that a fragmented field is likely to contribute to trump's leadership, while aid is anti-trumpovská diffusely spread among more than a dozen other candidates.
But from the beginning of September, Monmouth University survey shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
Carly fiorinou leads by 13 points, Marco Rubio 14 points for 15 points, Walker, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, John kasichem 33 points in each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead over a trader to broad 19 points in a hypothetical match one against one.
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters argue that he has already made his opinion.
A new CBS / nyt poll Tuesday shows that just over half of voters supporting trump maintains that she will not change her mind.
It is obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that he never changed his mind.
46 percent of States that keep options open for change among the candidates.
Yet it is the current outsider Trump's strongest opponent and his colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who regard their minds in the final, if they were twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans allegedly agrees with Trump on immigration issues.
Even from the moment Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech still holds and immigration as the main central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that the bombast of trump draws key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and the damage of a re-branding effort.
But according to Monday's new ABC / Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans claim that agrees with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will also stay.
Frustration with the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are today roughly half the support from Republican voters, especially given their underdog status.
Six out of 10 Republicans vote in Monday's new ABC / Post claims that they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry at Washington.
Vote Des Moines Register / Bloomberg Iowa several weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated Republicans in Congress, 54 percent is "unhappy" and 21 percent "angry as hell."
The House of Representatives supported a greater share of State charges for coal.
The Czech Republic receives more than 400 million.
The Chamber of Deputies supporting the government at first reading amendments to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of revenue from fees from open-cast mining of lignite Mining Company.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised members that, because of how they get extra money from the Treasury, so the budgets of municipalities.
The draft was criticized by members of the opposition, who fear that the mining companies won't want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they pay higher fees directly into the state government supported rozpočtu.sněmovna at first reading amendments to the Mining Act, which among other things means that the State should receive a greater proportion of revenue from fees from open-cast mining brown coal from mining companies.
The State ’ s share will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will be reduced from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also is changing the method of calculating reimbursement for minerals that the firm mined.
The change in charges for mining minerals has to bring to the Treasury about 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
On revenue budgets of municipalities have a neutral impact according to the government, because the fee is to be higher.
In the year of the fees received roughly 450 million crowns and the State budget of 150 million kroner.
From brown coal mining was about 200 million kroner to municipalities and State 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in remuneration of extraction area with the allowed drilling at 1,000 kroner per hectare per year.
Income from these payments still has in its entirety belong to municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) members said that municipalities to per year instead of 14 million to 100 million kroner.
The amount of mining fees will determine the law already provides for her, but by Government decree.
The payment will be calculated by multiplying the amount of newly harvested the mineral and rates for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, is the reason for the amendment, among other things, the possibility of flexible reactions to the current economic situation.
MP ODS Marek Benda but warned against by setting the fee by government may not be in line with the Constitution.
According to the Minister, but the doctor isn't in this case because the State tax levied on mineral, which is state property.
The fees, receive only mining villages, whose territories are affected.
In the case of deep-sea mining coal will get three quarters of the money municipalities and a quarter of the State.
The same ratio will also be the case for the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money, which the State mining royalties from selects will be ring-fenced.
For example, 28 percent will have to go on damage control, after logging, mining or to ensure the emergency services.
The draft criticized opposition MPs who claimed, in particular, that will damage both municipalities affected by mining district.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and mayors), warned that mining companies no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they pay higher fees directly into the State budget.
"it is not possible to tunnel in one of the poorest regions, only to the Minister of Finance budget retrofits," said David Kádner (dawn) elected in Usti region.
Before the surge in unemployment pro MP warned KSČM Hana aulická.
Kádner aulická and unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to reject the law, wanted to get back to government Kučera completion.
In the explanatory memorandum is that, according to the mining firms to increase fees reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent of the contracted in the long term.
The main consumers such as power plants or CHP plants should therefore not feel price growth.
"on the other hand, however, this really increases the risk that mining organisations will increase in reimbursements to compensate for the efforts made to reduce their operating costs, which would have meant essentially reducing staff," admits the government.
It is, however, an increase in fees from the point of view of employment viable.
According to the rapporteur, to the novel Milana Urbana (ČSSD) is the key to members before the approval of the law knew the conclusions on the updated Energy Concept, and especially the government's decision about the limits on coal mining.
If coal will also benefit the limits, then it will have implications for the proceeds for the State and municipalities, he pointed out.
Urban disagrees with Mládek, in that the decision of the breaking down of the Czechoslovak army should fall until after 2020.
Limits on the CSA down, he says, should break it for social reasons, and because of the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Jolly will lead the Czechs as number one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear in the Davis Cup draw Thursday baráže in India on the board and this time each of them probably will hit even in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil is planning that, given the difficult conditions to spread the load across the quartet.
In Delhi, there is heat and high humidity, therefore expect challenging matches, which can stretch to five sets.
We need to take that into account.
I'd like it spread by the weather.
And how will that look back at practice today, said Czech selection in downtown gladyou kumára khánny.
With one team and world forty George cheerful counts in both Friday and Sunday's singles.
At position number twos are likely to roll over to Luke jelly and Radek Štěpánek.
I would like to join in with almost everyone.
Slowly I got it in my head, but I won't say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech lineup should be štěpánkova participation in Saturday's doubles.
Only question is, who will stand next to an experienced deblisty, who is in doubles in the Davis Cup record 18: 4.
It probably won't be happy.
Options with jelly, or Adam pavláskem.
"I really don't know who and how it will look," he said.
Decides to singles under development.
It may be an option, with cheerful Pavlásek surprise in round 1 in doubles, winning over Australians.
"it's nice to play some doubles," said Navratil.
Against Australia, I did it right, if I play, I'd like to show the same performance there, I showed from the second set.
"I'm glad for the experience and I would like to bring," said Pavlásek point.
Domestic singles to Yuki bhambriho (125th in the ATP rankings) who won a challenger last week in Shanghai, where he beat players ranked third and fourth hundreds.
Two will be somdev devvarman (164).
They are both players of challengerů and our experience of the ATP Tour, but a lot of times we see that already in the Davis Cup rankings to decide.
"the present form, the weather," he said.
Friday's opening singles start at 6: 30 CEST and can stretch out because of the weather.
Rain is forecast and Kurt is not under the roof.
However, the play may, in artificial light.
And it has already sparked some two thousand Lux, which is enough.
"it should give tap out under the lights," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut at Prime Minister's questions
Since his election Mr corbyna pmq's debut in very enthusiastically expected
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will have its debut in Prime Minister's questions later for the first time, and will have to work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will take the first of his six allocated questions shortly after noon, while his performance probably will be carefully studied media and members.

He also stated that he might skip a few sessions, which would have left his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of the leadership of Mr. corbyho, coming after his appointment to the Shadow Cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the TUC Annual Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence for the singing of the national anthem in the service on Tuesday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was met with criticism from a number of conservative members and is the centre of attention a couple of stories on the front page of the newspapers.
The decision of Mr corbyna no singing the national anthem has attracted attention on yourself
A spokesman for Mr. corbyna said he would be "stood in respectful silence" and recognise that "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of the Shadow Cabinet, Mr corbyna Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that labouristickému leaders recommended the national anthem to sing "notwithstanding" his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr corbyna top team, citing differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party had initially supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work also "add" following the appointment of Mr corbyna over his position in the European Union and the government limit benefits.
Mr. corbyl stated at the TUC conference that workers party putting forward amended proposals to remove the entire thoughts limit benefits.
A few hours later, said Mr. Smith, the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, that the party "very clearly" said government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn is the fifth leader of the Labour party, he faced David Cameron in the last decade since his election as Conservative leader.
Leader of the Labour Party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has ideas "from the crowd," the questions for Mr Cameron and received more than 30 000 proposals.
Islington North MP claims that pmq are too confrontational and refrain from how "ready answers," sprocket, trade, and instead promises that will focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn argues that Angela Eagle, the shadow Business Secretary, will represent him at pmq, when it will not participate — like, for example, when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
Also dropped from the thoughts that he would let other colleagues to do it from time to time, because they had allowed it to even discuss the matter with the Speaker of the house John bercowem.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said that he wants to depart from the Punch and Judy style of politics "," which was often associated with pmq, but several years later admitted that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990 were seen as a key barometer of pmq's judgment, leaders of the house and their leadership position among the other MP, although critics argued that became a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.

Metcash's campaign in the country, to fight invasion Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IgA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Metcash's campaign in the country, to fight invasion Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers, and the first of the more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, metcash and IgA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build brand IgA using marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IgA retailers and suppliers are added with brands such as at dunsborough Simmo's ice cream maker based in Iga stores tastings and store owners are selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League, local customers.
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defence strategy of 29 September, when food, liquor and hardware vendor celebrates its annual strategic investor's day.
There is a lot at stake here, because southern and western Australia account for almost 30 percent of metcash and IgA commercial steps generate higher turnover than metcash IgA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial and IgA stores are enjoying a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - in SA, more than 30 percent and 24 percent in wa compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
Anyway, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believes that Aldi have the snares 5 per cent of the food market in these two States during the 12 months since the opening of the first shops that have taken sales from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
In its report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom kierath, estimated that retail IgA could lose $360 million in annual sales and metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West during the next year, it will generate sales of 500 and 600 million USD in different markets.
Loss of sales of the volumes of food and the fixed price basis metcash would have cost around $13 million pre-tax on revenues, confirmed Mr kierath.
At the same time, metcash loses share of markets in the eastern states, especially to Aldi and Coles, although recent Roy Morgan survey found that shoppers in Iga were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that metcash food sales fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and its market share reduced from 14 percent to 10.3 percent in 2015 to 2020.
Last week a leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "highly likely to disappear within decades.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglass comment.
But it is known that a member of the Board of the metcash Douglass contacted last week.
IgA's market share dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and earnings from the food trade, metcash, which supplies IgA, about 1,200 retailers fell by 43 percent from 2012, reflecting the changes because operational development speculation, sales and earnings are under pressure.
However, wholesale counterattacked and invest more than $150 million a year to supplement the regular price in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and so helps retailers IgA stores recall by adding the rapidly growing food and news from investors.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice, argues that the price and retrofitting programs catching-up shops caught momentum and hopes to return back to the basic velkoprodej profitable growth profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became collateral damage from the recent fuss around his friend Nick kyrgiose and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, argues the president of tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a junior member of the talented duo often called "Special KS," drew unwanted attention to yourself thanks affair with notorious kyrgiosem and Stan wawrinkou at Montreal masters.
Soon after, in passionate qualification game in Cincinnati, had to be his opponent, Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison after the referee had separated twice, Harrison said: "he had one stretch kyrgiosovi wawrinka and I should reach out to him, too."
While he was last seen smashing his racket after a spasm of Richard gasqueta derailed possible defeat at the US Open, staunchly defended kokkinakise Healy.
The young man is currently being held in Glasgow, where they compete with Sam Groth on the location in the second singles to Bernard romicem in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"pretty intense, I was thinking about that in my opinion it was a bit drawn into the whole dispute thanasi," says Healy.
Destroyed his racket when he lost to spasm in the US, but it's not the first player who would take over from the frustrations of himself took his anger out on his rocket thanasiho. I know pretty well, and I can tell you at this event will not be proud of.
But seriously controlled very well because he was in the U.S. exposed to circumstances very provocative about Harrison and so on, so, in my opinion, deserves great credit.
He has a great team around him, he also has a great family around me, and I think that his treatment was a little hard.
It's a very grown-up 19-year-old man, he works very hard, and fits perfectly into the team and so on, never had a problem with other players in the dressing room is very respected, he trains hard, he's in wonderful condition, it's a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged according to their own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook kyrgiose for an important match, which starts on Friday, and states that the "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but supports a native of Canberra to return to the team as the primary, long-term.
"first of all we want our team completely focused on the game and not at all the controversy that arose around him [kyrgios]," says Healy.
And I think Nick rose very quickly how Federer, Murray and other people point, in the eyes of the public, growing rapidly, also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight, when he would think about that, in my opinion, is the best solution for the team and for himself.
The European Migration Crisis: Hungary Declares State of emergency, closes borders and holding migrants
After the state of emergency announcement Tuesday Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia and held off those who tried to have her illegal crossing to stop the tide of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants piling up in no man's land and the Serbian authorities have responded indignantly.
The ones who are stuck at an unknown time on strips of land between two States are those who are fleeing the violence in their native countries, building tents and settling in.
But the feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter overhead, migrants are calling together "open the borders!" and cursing the Hungarian riot police unit.
Some in protest are refusing food and water.
Serbian foreign minister declares that it was "unacceptable" to the refugees were sent back from Hungary, while more of them arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, and not just the indirect harm.
During the next days will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries, "says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest maďarsko-srbské border came a day after a block of 28 countries didn't come with ongoing immigration policy at a meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to the sharing of responsibility for 40 000 people seeking protection in a surprised Italy and Greece and talked with the hope of achieving the eventual agreement next month or at the end of the year, which EU nations have accepted more than 120 000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Their hopes, however, Hungary Junior ROTC at Brussels or his neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the road and speed up court cases discussing asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania, to stop refugees who seek to transition through their country, when is now completed a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News korepondent Charlie d'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped put barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary became the main weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom fled from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted, however, that most of them are economic migrants who come for a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, which is a look that clearly differ from other EU States, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalising violation of 4 a three-foot fence, which the government let build on the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for a longer period in jail for those who illegally transferred the refugees.
"because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we have the clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, the Parliament must still approve the deployment of the army, which was expected in the next week, but associated press reporters watched on the border of heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy bakondi, adviser to Orban for home defense, said that the authorities caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and captured 15 already on the territory of the State.
Using the damage through the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing offences under the new laws.
Authorities quickly left to fix the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after they used a tractor truck covered with barbed wire.
At the main border crossing at roszke was a mess, because the Hungarians opened an office in the tiny metal container for processing and throngs of people.
About 20 of them could be inside, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, when they refused food and water until they're allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton ahead of Bernie Sanders was halved in the national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton holds a double-digit lead in the race for the Democratic nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders gaining on her head start.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to be president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters argues that it is too early to say that there are clearly a decision about which candidate they will support.
But Clinton ’ s backers are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
From a CBS News poll from last month, Clinton lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and mitigates, but her lead narrowing.
Her support among men has reduced dramatically, and Sanders at her loses only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under 50 years evaporated and now are equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has a big lead thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in double digits ahead of Sanders among liberals, but now it is losing to Sanders in this group, only 5 points.
About half of Democratic primary voters in the United States say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support it only for that, it's a candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
I guess it's no surprise that are contemporary přivrženci Clinton because of her particular passion.
Views are mixed between those that currently do not support Clinton -- only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same of my golden boy, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When are Clinton supporters are asked in an open question, why do they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that he has the right experience (16 percent), followed by that, it's time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mentions her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It also cited a big choice election and consensus on the issues.
While the Vice President is considering a potential candidacy for President, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would wish to face - a third thinks that she would not run for president.
When Democratic primary voters were asked whom they would have chosen as the second choice for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters claimed more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton ’ s leadership will spread out of 20 points, when Biden will run, 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning in the general election; but this number dropped from 78 percent from last month.
Biden is on a scale far in the other, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely zvolitelného, increases.
However, when it came to the question of greater importance, the Democratic candidate, voters prefer solutions to problems before a greater chance of being elected.
As of last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, have good results in certain key characteristics between primary voters of his party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and he thinks they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden from all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same of Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent on him doesn't have this view.
Democratic primary voters also generally sees that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
For all those standards, about a quarter of democratic voters to Sanders has no opinion.
How questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email account and server as Secretary of State continues, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of this matter, and they say that their overall view of her influence at all.
But among the American public overall, it's a different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third of it's satisfied.
The public's views on this topic were divided in March, shortly after this problem came to light.
Most Americans claim that this email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, compared with 36 percent of their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
It's all about the Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy among voters her party, this question is still a problem among registered voters overall: just 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, a fall of eight points from last month, and about 15 points since may.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters thinks she is honest and trustworthy.
While 55 percent of registered voters across the country also sees Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested in honesty best led Biden, Carson and bush.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters didn't view on him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson over Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest survey, CBS News / New York Times
The two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest survey and others for their support.
From the ranks of Republican voters across the country overwhelmingly continue to support Trump, and climbed from 23% support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the debate on fox news last month, 27% on Tuesday.

"we need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with death of a first-year student Baruch College
Almost two years after a student died during a fraternal přetěžovacího ritual in the pocono mountains in Pennsylvania, was filed murder charges against five men.
Brotherhood members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during initiation ceremony in September 2013 and delayed took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Police officers stated that he was blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand, a total weight of 30 pounds and has been repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the objectives across frozen fields.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of headaches and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity didn't call 911 immediately after he fainted, and Deng allegedly waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, the police said.
However, they have found the time to change clothes, Deng Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the National President of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, said police chief Chris - at the press conference.
"in this moment members started hiding gear and basically preferring welfare brotherhood before life Michael Deng," stated chief Wagner.
Unable to revive him and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck by blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"too many families were zdevastováno due to overloading and at least one student bratrstvích die each year because of hazing since 1970," writes Douglas fierberg, an attorney representing the family, dengue, in a statement.
Brotherhood and their members must responsibility and this is an important step on the part of the authorities.
Monroe County grand jury recommended charges of murder in the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault and criminal organisation is coming back.
"we want to hold not only the parties involved, but in the event that there is an organisation, which approved it, whether officially or unofficially, shunting responsibility also," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and national fraternity voided its relationship with local branches.
This, with tents, when the Fed raises interest rates
Growth rates comes and bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy slides into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it would take and how long it will take.
For the economy, in particular, offers a little history on the timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, though not always, will be decisive in how the economy and financial assets to respond.
That's why the U.S. Central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors would not be focused on when it begins raising rates, but rather the trajectory, how long will it take to standardisation.
The game is actually more variables.
In the end, however, may be members of the market to make sure that all this fuss over a speed increase may be exaggerated.
"the Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as' the end of an era of cheap money, '" said in a note for clients Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
By contrast, we don't anticipate that a gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low, creates a seismic shock, which many fear might be.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here's a look at how they react to certain areas of the economy, on the basis of historical trends:
Given what market experienced in the last month of the CCA, the expected rate hikes may make the air a little bit unstable.
As soon as there is increasing, but the effect will not be so dramatic.
"it appears that there is a trend for stopping the shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect LAGs in monetary policy," argued Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study about what happens after the Fed ’ s increase.
More precisely, the market for the last 35 years most often - about 14 percent - aiming to increase rates in relatively flat in 250 days (the average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with the average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis, the chief equity strategist Bob dolla Nuveen asset management company, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the stock tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rate increases and the return of beginning to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but increase rates often help her.
The Fed is currently facing certain conditions that still exist, and which could hasten a recession.
The most remarkable is that the gross domestic product, close to its lowest point in the history of the Fed ’ s interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank was raising rates during 118 only twice since 1950, the year-on-year increase in nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few expect his keeping in the third quarter, when it was only 1.5 percent, states the Atlanta fed.
Raising rates in this difficult economic background could be risky and might occur, "the question of whether this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market participants were ready for the Fed ’ s growth all year and all eyes turned to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which was held this week and ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that at this meeting, the FOMC could approve the increase, future trading indicates only 25procentní probability.
"in our study since 1950 zvyšovací cycles were all still in the great cycle of increasing leverage with the recession with GDP peaks quickly after the beginnings of recovery," it says in the report.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of these, when the Fed waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we're on 74 months and still continue.
Fixed income was also volatile, because the market is expected to increase rates, and the model is somewhat similar to what they're experiencing shares.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable for bonds than for equities, when the Fed will change the direction of policy.
For bonds, it appears that the proceeds are changing direction immediately after the arrival of the first cycle of increase / decrease.
At the end of a cycle of increasing bond yields fall immediately, "said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that the increase in rates will cause approach yields between long- and krátce-datovanými bonds, which matched the curve.
High-yield bonds often in this climate, they work better, though, "we're still cautious about tightening," the decree stated in its analysis, Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst firmly in the company of Schwab.
What's interesting is that Jones thinks that markets are no longer adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that prospects for the market to adapt to tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, firms which carry out most of their business in the US, win for an increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with lots of debts will fare worse, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the space of the world market and their debt will be larger too.
"history shows that" quality "shares tend to be overcome during the three months after the initial rate increase," said Goldman analysts sachsve in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets ahead of the company ’ s weak balance sheet in any increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004, an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns to capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also overcome their counterparts lower quality (an average of 4 percentage points) or 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of variable interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Beyond purely stock games benefited consumers also thanks to the US dollar.
Savers may also see their profits through higher yields, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the classic FM, claims MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "fertilizer"
Takes the view that it's increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rivals
Also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says that the British simply cheat
A parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked voice and says he is not even original idea
BBC Radio 3 to "changes" in the classic FM, claims a leading parliamentarian and piling fresh pressure on broadcasters to demonstrate that they are doing something that commercial broadcasters don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said that BBC bosses, the public service radio station seems to be "ohlupována" and is increasingly nerozeznatelnější from a business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word" ohlupováno "- but he seems to be turning into classic FM," he said.
Also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC music awards, which began last year seems to be the British under another name.

The Director General of the BBC, denied the charges on the grounds that the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival, in terms of live music and public education.
What I've learned about classical music on radio 3, I learned that on any other radio station.
And their commitment to live music and making music is, in fact, at the elite level.
"I also think that the commitment to finding new Music Radio 3 and placing in service new works is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year the regulator argued the BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey, it is now necessary to work harder to audience participation than before, because the British are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was the only element of production for the BBC came under fire for stepping on the foot of commercial competitors during a broadcast of the Culture, Media and Sport, and they got to a hearing of the Commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked the musical talent show "The Voice" - which the BBC bought from a Dutch producer Talpa media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
You can see why this programme is discussed as non-original and not especially different?
Lord hall insisted that BBC one show in September - which stars Paloma faith aboy George as judges - was made "in a manner typical of the BBC."
He added that he wants to "find a hit of the corporation's own stables" will start when the next time an entertaining series.
However, refused to rule out ordering more future seasons of the show the voice or spending taxpayers ’ money in royalties to other entertainment formats.

Mrs. Laura says that he wants to hire more women in stores (B & Q, because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store doing better halves.
Currently, most of male workers.
She said that there is a need to address growing demographic trends that show more women take more households, which carries out domestic adaptations than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says: "still with us in stores works mostly men.
We need to come closer to balance.
Basically half our customers are women, carried out by 80% of decisions on purchases of goods.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laura, which is one of just five women at the helm, according to Britain's leading companies, the ftse100 index also přestrukturovala her crack team to reflect equality between men and women.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women among the staff including the Chief Executive and financial director.
Mrs. Laura says: "it was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't difficult to find good women that we would take to us.
Kingfisher said the slump in sales and profits in the half year after the group took the costs of closing stores.
The result of the trend in Kingfisher, which owns B & Q and screwfix, is to open 200 new stores

In from the cold pressing seeds remain in oil all the healthy substances.
That's why these oils are appropriate as part of a health diets, for example, gall.
Some extra virgin olive oils are appropriate for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

The company also produces Sesame oil and roasted sesame seeds used exclusively white.
An hour can handle our press press 8 pounds sesame.
Mechanical pressing the material heats up to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for designation extra virgin.
At higher temperatures would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil is good for diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
Czech favourite between sunflower oil is.
From research hamerské Jarmila Novotná, who led at the Masaryk University, has shown that it prefers the warm kitchen, 43% of respondents.
In reality, however, the cooking is not suitable, at 180 ° C begins to burn through.
Is it better to use the example of the seasoning salads and convenient particularly in the diet, which helps to prevent cardiovascular disease.
It contains a high proportion of Omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which most of all the fatty acid reduces cholesterol.
Problems with the heart to watch on the overall amount of fat and calories.
In one example, a tablespoon of sunflower oil is 62 calories in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil is 99 calories.
As regards the energy value of foodstuffs, it is important to realise that they are natural foods with more nutrients than the so-called empty calories.
You are part of the industrially formulated products.
It is therefore appropriate to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower lasts just like sesame and hemp 9 months.
Storage in the refrigerator to extend the shelf life yet.
Old people know the oil particularly under the slightly bitter taste.
On the contrary, the glitch is not opacity on the bottom.

Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Hemp seeds are technical, and therefore to the so-called superpotravinám hemp oil is believed to be the healthiest from vegetable oils.
For this designation is the highest content of Omega 3 and Omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids your body can't make itself, and one must receive from food.
Particularly important is the intake of Omega 3 fatty acids.
Scientists study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that a daily intake of the substance is insufficient.

The fact that you found this oil route to consumers, confirms the fact that, in the company of Bohemia oil belongs to the bestselling.
500 litres a year to sell him.
People often use a spoon on an empty stomach in the morning.
Hemp oil is not significant, but great taste boost immunity, said Daniel Vlcek kraslické oil firms from Bohemia.
According to statistics are most passionate nation grilovačů Americans.
There seems to a household 1.4 grill.
All over the world, then held a variety of barbecue contests, which only confirms the success of the culinary discipline.
The Czechs are not far behind.
On the basis of consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that a mere 4% of the people in my life negrilovala.
The vast majority of then barbecuing and several times a year.
In order to be successful, we must not underestimate the barbecue is ideal preparation - Edit marinating meat several hours before the heat treatment.
That oil is the best and at the same time, the barbeque leaves health beneficial substances?
In general, the actual trial barbecue should conserve fat.
Experts agree that a large part of the oils at high temperatures begin to lose its flavour.
Healthy extra virgin oil then comes about body beneficial substances which of them otherwise we get during the consumption of the oils of the dishes prepared at lower temperatures.
But that doesn't mean that extra virgin oil find grilling his exercise.
Grape seed oil for the barbecue, health and beauty.
When you say meat, experts from the firm of Bohemia oil from kraslic Sokolovsku comes immediately to mind the grape seed oil.
Wonderful supplements the LAG I taste of fish.
In the kitchen is characterised by increasing the unique properties of the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, because he has a high degree of incineration, when 216 ° C.
Even with such high temperature then, as one of the few oils holds the wholesome substances, describes the benefits of grapeseed oil firms from Daniel Vlcek Bohemia oil, which is one of the few Czech producers of this oil from the vine.
Experts agree that the grape seed oil is 50 times more potent than vitamin E and 20 times more potent than vitamin c.
It also contains high levels of linoleic acid, and is effective in fighting with an excess of cholesterol.
In grape oil also takes our body important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favourable content helps to lower high blood pressure, increases the metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
The consumption of grapeseed oil also help increase our external beauty - improves the elasticity of the skin, it is used to treat acne and helps care for dry, brittle hair.
Chefs in the kitchen of grapeseed oil you use pork.
Not only is suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, the seasoning salads, but also for heating and dishes.
The barbecue can be used in two ways, when marinating and grilling itself.
Marinating meat and fish we maintain their succulence.
It must be present in the preparation of the marinade three components: oil, acidity and spice.
For example, the acidity of the cider vinegar and deliver to soften the meat.
Again, spice adds flavor the meat and oil preserves and adds savor, advises Daniel Wolfie.
At the same time, it adds that grape seed oil for marinating is ideal, because as one of the few oils can penetrate through the dark meat.
Marinated meat or fish are therefore ready to barbecue, how to proceed?
Extra virgin olive oils are characterised by the fact that in the preparation of foods are just a few drops.
Same goes for a barbecue.
Some of the oil for this method of preparation are completely taboo.
This concerns in particular the flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not at all warm.
Before the grill with oil to lubricate the grate to prevent light meals.
Barbecue is also an essential part of the preparation of the Annexes.
To grilled meat and fish goes virtually anything - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, a green salad, and many others.
The chefs in Bohemia oil they recommend, for example, salad, hot summer.
You need to: • 1 pack peaches • 1 bunch arugula • 1 cup sliced cucumber • 1 cup of mixed salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of grapeseed oil
Add to the mixture to the salad bowl pulled arugula salad leaves, sliced cucumber and diced the big peach.
According to taste salt and pepper on me, you can also sprinkle with minced chili and soy sauce.
At the conclusion of a few drops of oil pokapejte grape.
For exceptional taste then you can gently sprinkle the salad of sliced almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: not just drugs, but also on the will of the patient to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs care of a number of experts: neurologist, a physiotherapist, therapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
But it's not just about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultation, even if they decide to have a child, to care for these sick includes advice, recommendation when adapting social housing etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient.
The more actively fight with the disease, the longer it can work and does not fundamentally change the style of his life.
Indeed, as doctors point out, the passivity of patients for the disease activity.
For example, it is shown that regular exercise significantly delaying the time when sick needs some compensatory aid, such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their surroundings were not subject to various myths, such as that the disease is automatically leads to end up in a wheelchair.
This created the page and give yourself a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign, give yourself a chance.
The most important person in the care of patients with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis pays twice the adage that the disease starts to heal rather sooner, the physician can influence things.
It is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the process is not yet so strong neuro-degeneration.
The earlier we intervene, the greater the hope is that we can stop and delay the debilitating disease, explains Dr. Eva honey from a neurological clinic General University Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitative care, which most often addresses the weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
With the sick to work according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthening the pelvic floor, mitigate swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.
"it's very individual, depending on the specific problems of the patient," says Dr. Martin kövári, the chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic in Motol University Hospital.
People with multiple sclerosis may indeed suffer from the same disease, but each has a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation can't stop the illness, but always can alleviate her symptoms.
Physical activity also stimulates the immune status of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another encouraging sign of regular exercise is the fact that you are sick, what can handle everything, and it reinforces their confidence.
"the exercise also releases endorphins, wash and they make you feel good," notes Camilla Ph.D.s řasová rehabilitation medicine clinic, university hospital of Vinohrady.
The physical side of our relationship, we operate the limbic system responsible for emotion.
Right so we intervene in psyche even immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"previously, these patients so-called saving, we know today that they need a targeted burden," says prof J.R. Pavel Kolar, the head of the clinic for the rehabilitation and physical medicine Teaching Hospital in Motol.
Physical therapy is in order, to be self-sufficient as long as possible, including the post.
Physiotherapists ergoterapeuty therefore cooperate with each one received the compensatory aid him at the Garden of Peace.
Many patients need care and a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When you get a serious illness in my life, most people will shake it.
They're experiencing shock, panic, fear.
Must respond to a major burden - loss of health.
With such aching souls have gone to someone, not to try to take everything on his shoulders.
"I work with them so that they eventually came to the conclusion that, even with the handicap can live a full life and multiple sclerosis, that doesn't mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata raspberry - Schubert from the neurological clinic of the general University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague latecoere manufacturer Airbus would not fly.
Aircraft production is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technologies.
The new planes are filled with light and solid titanium or composite materials which, just so someone can't make and process.
Still, it's next to superpřesných, computerized machine tools, beside autoclaves for moulding composites hit on something so mundane, such as apricot seeds.
In the drum, which recalls the pot on the cotton candy, in a pile of stones to espouse edges Sheet parts that just came out of the frézovacího machines.
"no one has yet come up with anything better," smiles the Director General producer Ivan Dubský air door latecoere Czech Republic.
On the premises in a Prague earlier Letov Vystaviste manufactures complete the door to Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world supplying the door for Brazilian Embraer 170.
The door, part of which is drawn up in Prague, also come in first and upper class passengers on the upper decks of the world's largest airliner, the Airbus A380.
They're installed here and the door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the motto here.
Maybe cold-cranking keys leaves firm adjusted twice a year.
If the yellow sticker missed the record, they should explain in Prague race what auditors from Airbus or Boeing who ride regularly to check if the doors are produced according to agreed rules.
Human senses but not yet advanced technique completely.
On one door into the A320 is 1500 rivets.
You must shake nýtaři manually.
It takes them two days ago.
Even the sound of hammers to see if it's properly rivet flustered.
Tolerance, in which they move, they are minimal.
Rivet may appear above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
When it comes to a number of trained pummel.
When the inspector runs a finger across a row of rivets, it knows if one is out of tolerance.
Until then, she will pick up the exact úchylkoměr.
Letov fed before 1989 L-39 training programme for military aircraft.
But in 1991 he made neither one.
The firm had to quickly find a new contract.
That's when put together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for the emergency door supplier for the A321 model.
Courtship with Boeing were not so lucky.
"we were for them, then a small firm, which did not have enough money for investment and to Boeing could guarantee long-term stable supply," recalls the outcome.
The door to the American manufacturers would remain shut, if Letov in 1999 delivered at the Prague Conference of the International Association of Aerospace Industries latecoere French group.
I was talking about our collaboration with Airbus.
The next day it started negotiations with the French, says the outcome.
A year later, the Czech firm latecoere companies came in and bought a new contract.
In 2000, soon started assembly of parts of the door for the A320.
Three years later, the doors were added to the upper decks for the A380.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for processing composites for the delivery for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without latecoere ourselves to these big contracts.
Maybe we were doing small parts or components.
Partners want guarantees of supply for twenty or thirty years, explains the outcome.
Last year, the Czech latecoere reached 2.9 billion turnover over and profit after tax 147 million crowns.
An exclusive position between suppliers and aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague since 2000 has invested 1.5 billion crowns.
The firm must have certificates of quality certification, 170 special production processes and certificates of qualifications for key employees.
Without them, the company did not produce any doors into aircraft.
To obtain certificates that manufacturing processes meet customer requirements, and multiple checks to keep them standing under Dubský million crowns.
The production processes changed every year.
Are stricter and stricter.
We have the staff, equipment and doškolovat dovybavovat again the whole process to certify the outcome, he adds.
Now the firm is finalising the preparation process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the existing for human health harmful cadmium.
The award may have got from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology for equipment or chemicals, which are used in Prague.
People are coming from Boeing, will examine the entire service concept.
Then we bring them to production.
Also check out our laboratory.
One set of samples to test themselves in his lab and then compare the results with our approach, the outcome is controlled, the way the customers.
They are rewarded with the Prague firm long-term exclusive contracts.
The race today with the Prague production embraerů stands or falls.
For the A320 family generates half of the total volume of the door.
Replace the Czech latecoere is for the Brazilian or European producer either impossible, or very difficult.
However, this does not mean that the door you could say for any price.
Part of the contract price curve.
This indicates how many doors will happen after ten, fifty, hundred of pieces produced.
The price is still dropping to a certain limit value.
Into this price formula, we need to go in.
If not, we'll lose money, says the outcome.
Half of the lobby, where the electrical closet are assembled for a military aircraft Airbus a400 m, is still empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, there is building new polorobotická line to the riveting and upgraded model fitting doors for the A320 Neo.
The riveting to accelerate and refine.
"this is the trend, which the assembly in aviation is going," adds the outcome.
Sales of future line has been secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of new A320 model.
Just a couple of yards off line for a complete fitting doors for the upper deck of the A380.
It's a strategic decision our parent company.
The aim is to reduce the time of production and reduce costs.
The full assembly could begin within two years, says the outcome.
However, the company must go through before qualification tests necessary for fitting certain electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.
The firm is betting on further development of production of composite materials.
In addition to the Boeing should involve on the new Airbus A350, which will compete with the Dreamliner.
"it's a huge credit for the firm, in addition to the metal materials can also be processed composites," says proudly, the outcome.
However, latecoere in the Czech Republic is on the edge of the production capacity.
Letov campus is located, have another place is not.
Before the company was French mothers 180 employees.
Now there's 800 and in three years there could be over a hundred more.
As long as they compete to Airbus and Boeing, how many hundreds of new aircraft, the airline every year, they order need not have worried about work.
Although he has contracts for several years, the parent company of the Prague latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group should have enough money for the September loan repayments.
Eventually the latecoere could deal with major creditors.
At the end of August they traded part of the loans for shares.
Creditors received in the company of a capital increase to €57.4 million share of 37.4 percent.
The debt of the company decreased by two-thirds, namely about EUR 180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company has subscribed to the new shares to existing shareholders 222,9 million euro.
So she raised a total capital of EUR 280 million.
However, the group benefited from the increasing production of the Airbus and Boeing, who are involved in sales, 85 percent.
Average growth is expected to contract by four percent per year until 2017.
In the custom book has orders for €2.6 billion, which corresponds to a four-year production.
French Media claims that latecoere, finally, after years in the VA can breathe again.
In Prague, the Czech race Vystaviste is significant for the group.
To the revenue of the group contributes 16 percent.
According to the number of employees is the largest foreign branch of the group.
The deputies supported a greater share of State charges for coal.
The change in charges for mining minerals has to bring to the Treasury about 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
On revenue budgets of municipalities have a neutral impact according to the government, because the fee is to be higher.
In the year of the fees received roughly 450 million crowns and the State budget of 150 million kroner.
From brown coal mining was about 200 million kroner to municipalities and State 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in remuneration of extraction area with the allowed drilling at one thousand crowns per hectare per year.
Income from these payments still has in its entirety belong to municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) members said that municipalities to per year instead of 14 million to 100 million kroner.
The amount of mining fees will determine the law already provides for her, but by Government decree.
The payment will be calculated by multiplying the amount of newly harvested the mineral and rates for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, is the reason for the amendment, among other things, the possibility of flexible reactions to the current economic situation.
MP ODS Marek Benda but warned against by setting the fee by government may not be in line with the Constitution.
According to the Minister, but the doctor isn't in this case because the State tax levied on mineral, which is state property.
The fees, receive only mining villages, whose territories are affected.
In the case of deep-sea mining coal will get three quarters of the money municipalities and a quarter of the State.
The same ratio will also be the case for the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money, which the State mining royalties from selects will be ring-fenced.
For example, 28 percent will have to go on damage control, after logging, mining or to ensure the emergency services.
A draft today criticised the opposition MPs who claimed, in particular, that will damage both municipalities affected by mining district.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and mayors), warned that mining companies no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they pay higher fees directly into the State budget.

In the explanatory memorandum is that, according to the mining firms to increase fees reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent of the contracted in the long term.
The main consumers such as power plants or CHP plants should therefore not feel price growth.
"on the other hand, however, this really increases the risk that mining organisations will increase in reimbursements to compensate for the efforts made to reduce their operating costs, which would have meant essentially reducing staff," admits the government.
It is, however, an increase in fees from the point of view of employment viable.
According to the rapporteur, to the novel Milana Urbana (ČSSD) is the key to members before the approval of the law knew the conclusions on the updated Energy Concept, and especially the government's decision about the limits on coal mining.
If coal will also benefit the limits, then it will have implications for the proceeds for the State and municipalities, he pointed out.

The time for a decision on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The whole world is watching how the U.S. Federal Reserve about to convene in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a vital decision on whether to increase interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists contacted by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve will take the decisions, now thinks it will stay dormant for some time, and still retain the interest rate in the range of 0-0,25 percent.
It's a historic event, because years had passed from the moment he sat down, when the Fed cut rates to zero.
The first time we're approaching a situation where the main central bank might be able to get to the bar and start from zero interest rate normalization process, "says Angel ubide, manager at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The American economy has performed relatively well, adding to the recovery in the form of trillions of dollars to the State account and only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less pink global perspective.
Markets have been warned to be prepared for the increase, but the circumstances indicate that he also sees a big chance against that step.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday, 20: 00 CET.
Shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend Monday in Mississippi - and later the same day, even your colleague - wrote a note, in which he says he's "Sorry" the first murder and that she wished she could take it back, revealed on Tuesday, and government agencies.

Despite the Monday announcement about lamb allegedly believed in a romantic relationship with Amy Prentiss Schmidt government authorities argue that a “love triangle ” there is“ no evidence ”.
Shawn o Steen with Prentiss, who had been married for over seven years, stated that it was "a great person".

Stars who lost their mojo
The actor (left), on the slide with his son Redmond (right), has had a stressful few years.
In 2001, fighting leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and, in 2008, he was arrested for drug possession.
All these things can certainly choose their tax.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months out of the game for a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left in tears and this injury that knocked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks that Shaw could be playing again at the end of the season.
Injuries caused a ruthless crackdown - Moreno in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw pushed his way into the area of PSF.
Nine minutes and was treated on the field was also needed an oxygen mask before he was taken to a hospital.
Van Gaal said: "he suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
He'll be taken tomorrow or maybe the next day and then further surgery in Manchester.
It's terrible - the boy who comes to Manchester in 18 years, it's very hard, but he's playing fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he was also wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of therapy and wouldn't be able to play in the group stage.
I believe that he will play again this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli Mexican punished.
Van gall hinted that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for themselves whether it was a penalty and a red card.
That was a very nasty surgery on both legs.
A tweet from the account, Shaw says: "thank you everyone for all their news," words cannot express how devastated, my road to recovery begins now and come back even stronger. "
Related: Manchester United's Luke Shaw recorded injuries in the defeat against PSV
English defender will have added motivation to recovery in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip coke, PSV coach, said: "it was a very nasty wound."
If any player leaving the field with such injuries, everyone is very sad.
It's never the aim of our players to hurt the opposition.
Moreno suffered a fracture to his foot in the match for Mexico against van Gaal's Holland at the World Cup in 2014.
"it's very difficult for him, because his intention was not to hurt opposing players, and when you hear about the severity of that injury, it's not good," said coke.
I wasn't able to see this moment.
I just saw the ball, who was heading in the other direction, so it seemed that touched him [Moreno], but I haven't seen surgery on Luke.
In an interview for the sbs6 Moreno stated: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult it can be such a thing.
I feel very badly, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés saved was also rushed to hospital after surgery Chris smallinga.
David Cameron certainly knows the Lorax better?
This thing every parent knows: when you fall in love with the baby book, it doesn't take long to learn her almost by heart.
However, this must not be David Cameron.
When asked to name the service providers patterns of children's favorite children's book, chose the Prime Minister, Dr Seuss the Lorax fable from 1971.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in the report published on the website of the company supercamps continues: "funny, touching, creative and with strong content, so I like to read to their children, because it was always the image or message, which I haven't seen before."
Well, except that in the following paragraph Cameron allegedly described books by elevator from the film of 2012, added more characters and details, filed a brief on the original text.
"in the city, walled thneed-ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by complying with her wishes to see a real tree," content is a short book, which records an unknown object of love Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that alone wasn't enough suspicious text supplied Cameron reads like a summary of the film the Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database website, and begins with the words: "in the city, walled thneed-ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would meet with the plot of the book, where the unnamed young man hears that devastates local nature, trees, removing industrialista greedy Once-ler, who despite the protests, the cover loraxe crouched, mustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, so relatively few significant PR Task got the assistant, who never read the Lorax child 20 times in a row.
A spokesman for Downing Street indicated that the text probably came from the office of Cameron.
Supercamps confirmed that the text has provided an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam lyth was in danger, but the omission of England still holds
Compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England selected for this tour, it will be under me repeating 3-0 defeat suffered last time in a test series, not very likely.
I would also not rule out winnings directly guests.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good players in this batting line-up spin and also the collective thinking is strong; bear the scars of 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball is emerging spinner moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, although it is unknown to level test series, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam lyth fell out of the England team experienced in the series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
Forget Adam lytha decision is a tough one for me to analyze, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests against two good attacks cost in challenging conditions and simple, but the harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on the basis of performance.
For instance, around the names Joe root were no question marks, which led to the notice, because — and this I already stated previously — players are their best'but.
A few other half-century and lyth could extend his series, but it had control over its own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, it's another opportunity.
England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position even though his performances were not quite 100 percent, and I'm not surprised; he's always been a team player.
The question of how much time he gets test batsman, to show he's a tough nut.
Lyth got seven caps — as well as Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance at home and abroad.
The only thing for which you might gripe, is that England has given first chance in the Caribbean — although Jonathan trottovi lyth was in the best form — but this is past a wasted opportunity.
Alex Hales comes and it's batter, whom I rate very positively.
It's x-faktorový cricketer, whom we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season when he got on the field against us 236 Trent Bridge, which has done so little.
He must at least be afforded the same opportunity, one given to his predecessors, but all this will of course depend on the overall lineup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, when moeen begins alongside cook, which would have got the extra spinner while retaining four quicks were raised and I have no reservations against it.
I don't understand why he can't bat left-handed strokemaker and this man has already demonstrated that it is an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was the number 3 and there is a big difference in that.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played their first 38 tests before his performance in 2001.
He immediately have accomplished three centuries and never looked back.
The team comes as a back-up spinner Zafar Ansari and when I had the chance to follow him, impress me as a very impressive young man.
People can watch his gross statistics — an average of 31 and 35 with the bat with a ball — and see it as a ferry, but not a lot of spinnerů who raised their hands, and selektoři opted for youth.
There's a lot to learn on this tour.
Outside the team, it appears that England made a few changes, and smart, to supplement their coaching staff.
The appointment of batsman mahela jayawardenea, from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches can be a master stroke.
He is one of the most beautifully playing guys who bring rich experiences that have experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part white-ball tour and will bring to the team so ruthless as energy, Spark.
I always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and like mahela has intellect, which can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, although they're consistent voices saying things that have been spoken before, can sometimes lighten and freshen up the atmosphere.
Collyho Durham team-mate Ben Stokes got the day off, as well as root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this Decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and do not create selektoři timetable.
And you have to remember, as the players that their job depends on results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
Brexit campaign could win by 2017, if the economy starts to stagnate.
Half-baked David Cameron's renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with every day that passes without the genius of Jeremy's election "is that a yes or no?" Corbyn to the head of the Labour Party, or the TUC on Tuesday to take up the whole situation around Europe.
Foreigners are also his corbyna and Nigel faragese.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained, as Europe is mired in various crises - not all of which are their own fault - some Member States have had enough British egocentric agenda, dividing concessions and disruptive changes to the Treaty, which mostly didn't want.
At its Annual Meeting in Brighton with the TUC decided that even if they don't want it eroding social protection.
We could even call it a selfie agenda Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor goes to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, they take a picture in front of the famous local monument, with or without the local dignitaries, and then returns home with the words that win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to wear nezahleděnou Britain in Europe European - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some myopic ministers and officials in some major cities to get to a point where we left them on the matter.
Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, is carefully balanced ally, but have been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his post before it becomes wrong for her, as it has for too long continuous Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand and Kohl (14) (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
Also, his power is waning.
Poland may soon have the nationalist government on the right-hand side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how the selfie to help break the legs of the British people who could better invest your energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want to, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately unhelpful remarks style SNP during the referendum campaign in 2017 the UK to accelerate the process of Brexit, says a friend.
"renegotiation" and "solve the problem Britain has nothing of value from negotiations."
The Europeans know how to own injury can be predatory in Fleet Street, and how the EU oligarchs are skeptical of the press barons during the referendum, because they weren't inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, supporting our entry in 1973 in a 2: 1 ratio.
You may vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, dishonest euro-oportunistu, who made his name as a Brussels EU Rapporteur "straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his vanity Ed Miliband knew its enemies.
Included a mixture of taxes, non-payment of ruffians foreigners hackujících phones and pseudo nezámořské departments, which owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought about them the same, but he realized that when you're in a cage with her wild gorilla, you must throw bananas, to give you to dinner and then also to tea.
In fact, he was more like a Blair than Miliband, Blair himself, when he said Cameron ’ s referendové routine, since Blair accepted the principle of the EU, which repealed the Constitution was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and acquired his card being fired.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear me, Jeremy Corbyn, who on Monday in Westminster a friendly pat on the back - I told him that he must not waste time on me - seems to be in the danger of accepting boycott Murdoch Neil Kinnock strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of engaging the media, not me, but I'm sure with Andrew Marr, whose chair at the BBC on Sunday left.
Corbin official position vis-à-vis Europe, to put it mildly, is developing.
Claims that he wanted to stay in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the rabid UKIP tendencies and wild on the banks of the Tory's small englanderismu it may certainly accede.
The same thing, "said Hilary bemm but no benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner boy scout couldn't bring herself to admit that appointing corbynovo abrazivního McDonnell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father fought on TV about his allegiance, without going too far and lost his job.
The game Hillary was much more attractive.
But the fight for us to stay "in all circumstances" - bennina phrase - apparently wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what JC said colleagues and members on their private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the background, any sensitive image that Corbyn wants to communicate — remember, he touched me too - Discipline Reports remains important in ages televising all day and particularly in faith, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal, which are social media
Cameron is fair not to provide a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider aid workers party in referendové campaign for granted, as noted by McDonnell.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But corbynovo mcdonnellovo and basic equivocation about membership of the EU - in accordance with their economy, besieging Bennite anti-kapitalistickou past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion between leftist dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences is the central principle of the doctrinal bickering.
Just like with his rationalization regarding NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that the campaign to end the JC won't want - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their domestic masters.
Why should she spend political capital of Paris or Berlin - also have suspicious voters - concessions for Britain when it seems pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed "the weak performance of the British military in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, including reducing costs of conservative government in power, as I was reminded on Monday with the start of what was called the Security Forum of British influence.
Experts criticise on electronic Review published by the Agency Public Health England
Declaration funded government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking, came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links with the tobacco industry, the researchers argue.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet criticism of evidence used in its report on electronic cigarettes by public health England (Phe).
The Agency has published "Phe mezníkovou" report last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But a few researchers questioned the robustness of the data and highlighted links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Journal, Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy base", on which the Agency Phe based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ, challenged the claim, which was supposedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "the basic principle is that public health policy should be based on evidence of efficacy."
They indicate that the general public might expect that Phe's assertion that the Agency is "the current best estimate is that the e-cig are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one of the 12 people meeting convened to develop multi-kritéria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their views on damages associated with the different products containing nicotine; the results of the negotiations were summarised in a research report.
McKee and capewell points out that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called euroswiss health whose CEO allegedly has previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent study.
Bat also endorsed the credentials of public health in the sustainability report, States.
One of the participants in the meeting 12 admitted funding from a manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but no financing, which reportedly earned previously from a tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for the selection of members of the panel is not available, but contains several known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of which also claim in the paper industry funding.
Some of the others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
Phe also attended the meeting in tobacco control.
The report arising in this group "eloquently admits" missing "hard evidence of harm of most products on most of the criteria," wrote McKee and capewell.
However, none of these references or restriction is not described in the Phe report.
McKee and capewell said that Phe claims that "so far, there is no evidence that the e-cig acted as a path to smoking for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at phe, said that the allegations in the BMJ have been answered before.
He said: "electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
Phe has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and what also displayed, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative risk compared with tobacco.
Almost 80 000 people a year die from smoking and smoking-related diseases cost the NHS £2 billion a year.
A clear emphasis on current evidence - that even if the e-cig are not without risk, carry only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fill our national competence.
The BBC should end with EastEnders, says former director, Channel 4
Former director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as Eastenders and the voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programmes which are not made of other British television.
BBC criticised for being put on the public service programmes, which will likely see only a handful of people, into the complex broadcasting times compared to his rivals "biggest rating show, and on channels such as bbc4.
After Director General Tony Hall says the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said, he was trying without success to the connection with the BBC for six years, which he worked on Channel 4.
"I struggle with the idea that the BBC and broadcasting programmes that would surely have been broadcast rivals without the contributions of the state," Johnson said in the Commission for the communication in the upper house, as part of the discussions on the future of the BBC.
If you can keep your license fees, of which I am not sure whether they are in the medium or long term is a good idea, should reduce the production of at least as regards programmes, which do not produce or other.
The voice broadcast in prime time, because they want to gain the widest possible support in the future.
The idea that no one else would not be broadcast, it's a joke, of course, ridiculous and pointless.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programmes which can be financed bezpříspěvkově.
The voice is one of them, another EastEnders, and, of course, produced on home soil.
Frankly, other channels for them I would have given my right arm.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting service.
I don't think it would in no way weaken the BBC.
Johnson, a businessman in the area who led the series, Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that they feel guilty by gaining ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comment about the BBC's most popular show repeats those former Sky Executive Director, Tony ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC to sell a show like EastEnders.
Johnson said that even hýčkanější public service programmes the BBC "passes on bbc4, where the audience quite often cannot be measured, but its power and can argue when they embark on a mission to justify your £4BN income from royalties," but of course we are doing all these obscure programmes, to which no one is looking. "
It is broadcast at a time when no one's looking at them.
As for the licence fee to the Commission, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find the regresivnější system about who gets the best value out of him.
Of course we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people for whom £150 is a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much, because they see not so much on the BBC.
The former director of the sky and Channel 5, David elstein, who spoke before the Commission on Tuesday, said that the BBC should revise its mission reithovskou meaning of "inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that the BBC was now a small volume of production has previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take a public role model for public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, to explain and entertain."
On the partnership elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms, which was aired on TV only a handful, and connect with the commercial to reporters, you could see them all online.
“sonogenetika ’ or controlling brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound pulses influence the direction in which the nematodes are moving.
Scientists bred worms with genetically modified the nervous system, which he can control with sound waves.
Tiny nematodes changing direction at a time when they are affected by sound impulses, which are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses are working so that they switch cells genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists reported that these worms are a perfect example of the new methodology called sonogenetika that uses ultrasound to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells and activate cells outside the body.
Sreekanth chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, explained to the guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - invasive procedure in which the patient's brain electrodes that stimulate the brain lymphoma-specific. E.g. method is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson ’ s disease.
Nematodes usually respond to an ultrasound, but chalasani found that reactions appear when it is placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
Find out how bubbles are intensifying ultrasonic waves, which then passes through the body of the worms.
Enhanced ultrasound waves operate in trp-4 ion channels, which are located in the membranes of certain cells of the worms.
He used sound waves to these channels open and activate cells to which they are linked, according to a report in the journal Nature communications.
To control nematodes chalasani ultrasonic waves, the genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain trp-4 ion channels.
Then, when he used the modified worms ultrasound, the sound waves were strengthened mikrobublinami and transferred to the worms, where on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is much like optogenetice, groundbreaking instrument, which enables scientists to neurons on and off using light.
Chalasani but left to hear that sonogenetika could have many advantages compared to the technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent to the optical fibre to the desired location in the brain may ultrasonic waves penetrate tissues without limit and be sent directly into the brain.
“We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target the human neurons and make them susceptible to temporarily ultrasonic signals used in clinical treatment to the treatment of neurological diseases," said chalasani.
He added that its method of application would also found in the treatment of muscle cells and the cells that produce insulin.

It manages the conversation and help you find the people you love, and those with whom you would be fun even if your eyelashes were on fire and they'd made a fire extinguisher.
Let people space.
Room people often change drinking at reception, places, film nights and municipal public places, but they're also the room where people dress up and adjusting their underwear.
Related: don't even think about that you started college and be in a relationship
Introverts in college are very short.
Your room should be a refuge, yet a lot of tracks on the amended mimopokojovou culture, which is a friendly, outgoing and contributes to a lifelong friendship.
It can be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture permits you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship continued, but I need you to leave, so I can get back to the energy I had used to interview you."
Try to understand when it's classmate tired of socialization - and maybe write instead of knocking him.
Speaking of: knock knock.
One kid in my dorm had a habit of that, if the doors are locked, it's invited in.
He saw a few things.
Do your friends thanks to baking.
Because you started going to university on the top of baking mania, knock on doors and show with plate upečenými cakes seems slightly less awkward, less than "welcome to the neighbourhood, I baked you something, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering home-cooked treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe it will come out, so that your face will join the succulent surprises.
That, of course, is the fact that you are a decent Baker.
Wrong condensed pieces of flour, sugar and jams that will probably lead the others pretend to sleep, if you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is common crime on college campuses.
The theft of the whole chicken, of course, is a crime, but it's a little bit of milk to your tea theft?
Check it twice with the owner of the milk.
There is a chance that, even if they offer you the milk inside the rampage.
If someone steals something, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little bit more mature than my roommate, who swapped my milk for the dishwashing liquid to punish thieves.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't make noise that distracts people from their sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also lures people in glass houses.
A girl from my hall asked his neighbors if he could keep it down, drum and bass because there were 3 in the night and morning should test.
Their answer was to amplify the music.
When it finally fell silent at 5 in the morning, let them sleep for two hours and then let out loud his own music, locked the door and left on his three-hour exam.
Would it not be romantic if your future husband went to the same college as you?
And, conversely, it would be awfully embarrassing if you mistook the roommate for his future wife, slept together, split up and they had to see each other every day, and it might also take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future husband, try to talk to at least a little bit with his groin.
The sublime moment when you realize that someone had left the keys in their unlocked room, there's a fine line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable lesson about their security and the entertainment that they can never hide anything - don't ruin someone's room and toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door for them and give them the keys to the bottle of water, which was then put in the freezer - but they never do not stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva is looking forward to the twins, even in the face of an uncertain future.
Eve's been through some rough times already during pregnancy with seven-year-old vítkem today.
His father broke up with her, and the preparations for and raising the child was alone.
I dealt with the situation relatively quickly - very I'm looking forward to the baby and I was looking at the positives.
Uncertainty and by being alone with a child, I tried not to.
And I'm sure I had hope that we are not alone now recalls long, Eva on her first pregnancy.
Then she met on the Internet in chat rooms, the elder Vasek, they began to talk about their favorite movies.
Eva with Vasek vítkem even brought him home from the hospital, but in the role of my stepfather was too hasty.
"for a time, then pulled out of the program," Eva in the documentary described four episodes in that 3.
The third series of Czech TV series motive is the search for happiness at the second attempt.
Vitek care and financial security families cope thanks to part-time work, and a big bailout to help mothers and aunts.
Not even the prospect of responsibility for someone else's child eventually Vaska's affection for Eva spoil.
Definitely got together around vítkových second birthday and he now understands Vasek as his dad and also address him as such.
Although he has Vasek has two grown-up daughters, fatherhood in sixty under their kids used words and also pays more.
Besides Vitek added another two years and I'm finally even twins.
"Vasek into our family floated kind of naturally, maybe even by the relationships that my mother didn't talk much," he thinks the smiling Eva.
Few places?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and ELA was born by C-section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis of pregnancy in conclusion.
It is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which are then in excessive quantities are found in the blood of pregnant and are reflected in particular the itching.
The disease is dangerous for unborn fetus facing premature birth and death for mothers after childbirth usually resolve spontaneously.
EMA and ELA to Eva's and Vaska's luck they were born healthy, even if they were only at 36 weeks.
Emičku placed in an incubator at the intermediate ward, where he works and vaškova niece, who made her take over and check in.
Elinka was larger and right after the transfer of the ICU room I had it in her possession, describes the challenging period after giving birth to Eva.
She spent 20 days in hospital until doctors release nesvolili with babies who had managed to reach the border of two pounds.
Waiting for the weight gain in children in maternity Eva joy but it didn't.
"I was mad with longing after her husband and children," recalls the difficult moments in the department the puerperium quadruple mother.
My husband and I even considered signing a statement of liability due to, inter alia, necitlivému approach one of the doctors.
But the doctors there at the end and was released with the twins, Eve and into a care home.
The stories of four pregnancies and births sends CT1 on Tuesday night at 21: 45 hours.
A total of extended family can downsize.
They live together in a house not far from Prague, where Eva had to make do with the electric dvouplotýnkou and crowded conditions.
A house had increased, but Vasek did Eve joy gas stove is mounted to the preparation of food for the six people more comfortable.
When will nejůř, we take turns on a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive mainly family warmth and pleasant atmosphere, and no size or shabbiness cottage.
For now, we're piecing together very well, better than we expected.
The worse the mess while he hides in a small space and kutalející babies sometimes passing, but at least we're all around, smiling, Eva, who can find a positive side to every situation.
Vaškova lighting designer in film work is no guarantee of regular income.
That's why sometimes goes out into the streets as a cab driver.
In his 60 years in the care of the finances of families and children physically handles, but how long is it going to be?
"I realize that given our age difference once it'll be me who this family living," admits Eva straight when asked about the future.
She'd like to go back to work, but even more tempting option her own business.
With four kids, I'm not a bargain for the employer.
If the worst comes to the worst, we can take turns with her husband, joking about a sympathetic blonde.
Apple suffered a yo-yo effect.
For everything they can display.
Faster processor, a camera with higher resolution, stronger chassis or speech-recognition force touch display, it is in a nutshell the priority recently presented the ninth generation of iPhones.
Those last two then they also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6S and 6s plus.
Apple's current trend is that each generation iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The only exceptions were the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to the previous iphonům.
Dvougramový weight difference to the detriment of the news was truly negligible.
However, that far from being the case for new iPhones.
Compared to last year's 6 and 6 plus iphonům weight grew at the smaller model is about 14 grams in a larger, then about 20 grams.
On the one hand, no wonder the affair last year, bending in pockets, apple racked up considerably.
The news is so resilient chassis from aluminium alloy 7000, which also reflect the weight.
But the much bigger impact they have on her display.
The technology used in Apple's new 3D touch Display, thanks to which they can discern the power of touch.
It was necessary to display another layer of capacitive sensors.
So mass displays of new iPhones compared to previous generations increased by more than double.
At the smaller iPhone originally from 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of larger then from 19 to 40 grams.
The iPhone 6s is so used to display the hardest component.
Weight only 143 grams is then for this news achieved thanks to a treadmill, which touched on most of the remaining components.
The larger model is the heaviest element then used batteries, however, her weight compared with predecessors didn't change.
Even in this case, it is evident that the biggest increase in the display.
IPhone 6s plus 5.5 "weight so reaches 192 grams.
How much will the new display technology to practical use.
The first users will be able to test it on the Friday September 25, when launched in selected countries will sell iPhones 6S and 6s plus.
The flakes are breakfast of champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Grotta paglicci Italian archaeologists have made a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of modern human habitation here from different times, including wall paintings, remains of tools, and so on and so forth.
In layer 23a, which is dated instruments until about 30 years ago but scientists discovered something very recalls, but what remains of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, the traces of oat grains, which on view probably went through a process of production so popular today flakes.
In her first grains in wet, then dry today, get rid of the packaging, the so-called glumellae, then steamed and rozlisují flat.
Cave in paglicci were able to discover grains, which was apparently nahřáta or buried, and then he probably crushed between two millstones - at least the telltale signs of the use of the two stones in a cave.
Scientists have therefore failed in its publication for the magazine PNAS demonstrate that the production process was conducted in a cave full of flakes, but the similarity is truly striking.
We also lack any evidence about how people could eat cereal, but the theory that it was with a liquid and perhaps even warm, of course, offers a completely logical.
It is also very interesting proof of how humans have used intensively cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If it is the oldest vločková interpretation is correct, the flakes were well ahead of agriculture about twenty thousand years.
New reports stations transport undertaking in the city of Brno.
Once again, I listened to the report the names of the stops in the trolleybus: hnusáčkova, a ghost, frázova spratecká.
Sure, the trolleybus was somewhat louder, so reports male voice was slightly less comprehensible than previously reported, when the bus stops in a female voice.
A woman's voice is higher in the deeper, so the noise of traffic is more recognizable than the deeper man's voice.
Although dpmb.cz argues that this anchor chose the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but I'm sure it collected from the studio recordings made in silence, which of course sounded quite differently than in the noise of the bus engine.
I live in Brno a few decades, so the correct names of all those zastávkek I know by heart, so I don't need this report, but the foreigners from elsewhere who are unfamiliar in Brno and for which these reports are intended in particular, may be confused and may on the final, where they arrived by mistake, then claim that this stop, which should get out of the car, was not reported.
Maybe he should get the choice - but better newscast anchor again - do it again, and this time tinged with normal transport noise and engine noise, in which the speaker croaking in the bus almost losing.
We didn't have to listen to any more names of stations heršpice šmírova, or water, then dive in creaking šalině to which I transferred in VW.
I assume that my old ears had worsened suddenly so much during that one day when the announcer stops changed.
Before that day I understood the reports quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the notes traťováka.
Not many people know what the government parties were the biggest and brightest so-called comprehensive background checks.
I took the liberty to reminisce.
The bus was late.
I bumped into the dispatcher's office the moment he came on the radio, that's just seven hours.
"you're lucky that you hit with Comrade Chief, came a minute before you, and it seems that's not in the mood," said the dispatcher, while I was writing in a log book.
Thanks, I will.
Tell me that I'm going after the districts for the revision of the small mechanisation.
It won't work, today there are background checks.
They are all shitting bricks.
What's it all about?
"you'll see," said the dispatcher.
Next you'll be too.
I ran out to the corridor.
The door opened and he appeared náčelnikárny chief.
The buttoned-up, deadpan, in an impeccably tailored uniform.
"good morning, Chief, sir," I said politely, and quickly switched the two buttons on his uniform jacket.
"good morning," came the reply, and I quickly ran to the second floor, without the cold, I realized the ominous tone of old, he said.
"you're messing with," welcome me engineer Eva, an elderly lady, which I appreciated.
She said she was even demoted her chief than comrades.
They are vetting, and you get barely.
How many times have I asked, what are these comprehensive tests, but one doesn't really want to talk about.
They tend to be once every three years, must the rest of them, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
He said, however, I see.
I pulled out of the drawer in the file folder with periodic reports and then phone.
"this holcman, come straight to me," said the chief's voice.
What is that?
We met and now nothing... "I muttered, but no one answered me, each to his thoughts.
"good day, sir, I'm here at your command," I barely omeldoval, I entered the náčelnikárny.
The chief was sitting behind the desk and a clipboard.
"comrade mechanizátore," he said, without looking up, and still looking closely at that paper, "your behaviour doesn't appeal to me."
He dropped the paper on the table, leaned back in his chair and stared at me, blanked the usual nasty, evil, and piercing.
I faltered.
What's going on?
Even yesterday, the deputy said that in the few months in office I worked very well and is very happy with me.
That chief did very well when he pulled me out of the platoon on long-haul event.
And now this?
You realize you're the tech track distance and hence must behave.
Such a greeting you used this morning, is simply unacceptable.
I stammered that using a greeting from childhood that I was brought up that way and I don't see anything wrong with it.
The chief that was like a red rag to a turkey.
"you're on socialist rail and the only acceptable greeting is honor work," said the chief of petulance.
And besides, you're still addressing superiors.
Once you say "sir" again and again "comrade".
But I'm not for you Mr Chief, but the chief comrade.
Deputies are comrades, chief deputy chief traťmistři traťmistři are comrades!
Kindly remember that!
Excuse me, sir... sir, I salute you but... but normal civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... it's an honour and a job, or comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...
"it's not your priority, you're not in the cold side," said the chief, who had calmed down a bit.
Still talking about that.
Anyway, just remember that you don't subscribe to that chair up to retirement.
It wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something is not his priority, with the concerned it didn't look good.
He stared at me for a moment, cold, piercing and I searched for words I would reply.
It also annoyed me his haughty first name basis.
Was only a couple of years older and played at God, actually soudruhaboha.
A jovial, pompous, arrogant, authoritarian, how he could use it right now.
All to be even more.
So be it, it's the chief.
Actually, not all, like him, the President of the party organisation, but also all straníkům nestraníkům, formal.
But the chief informally to many, especially those in whom he could exert his superiority.
Right now, for me he full of shit.
I thought of something about ass and it cost me quite an effort for me to shoot him in the face.
But it didn't come back, I'd have to ride to the picks, let alone trying to do an official for railways.
What do I feed two kids?
And a half-constructed building.
I was ready to cry but I controlled myself.
Him that pleasure.
"that's all for now, you can go," said the chief of the audience and began again inspected the paper, which had been in the hands.
He called me at 11: 30.
Everyone from the office were already there and on what issues, and how they answered that, yes, that would be good.
Only jožin pointedly said, as was his wont, we can't all work out, because I would have had to do with his comrade chief himself, and that it was safe.
The word "comrade" pointed out, as if he knew what me old wiped away in the morning.
In náčelnikárně was a nice reunion.
Comrade Chief behind his desk and at a long conference table other comrades, who had to decide my clerical life or death.
Cadre, President Roh, reporter from personnel officer for special purposes, something akin to the military, and Deputy kontráše, my boss.
And also the most important person, the President of the party organisation.
I knew him from the road.
A track worker podbíjel sleepers or pitchfork thrown gravel.
But also a former prison guard.
It was whispered that she wasn't any fun with him that day, I heard a big beast.
Tongues, they argued that the school came in seventh grade, with nothing to trade, nothing could.
And when the prison was canceled, ended up with a pick Sunday-afternoon.
But yeah, comrade, comrade, it was forged.
Chief motioned for me to sit.
My heart in my throat, nespolknutelná cone.
Read the report of the Committee of civil personnel manager from the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two kids, and so on and so forth.
So far, so good, I thought, and I would breathe a little better.
Then the opinion of the street party organisation.
This reflects the opinion of the Committee, is the same person wrote both.
But then it came!
Parents are longtime members of the parties, they refused to appear before the Commission and, subsequently, a revision from the speakers, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked sharply at me.
Personnel manager noticed and stopped reading.
The chief indicated that he should continue.
The rest was just worse.
I was a member of the City Committee of SSM, and there I was obtained for the candidate of the party.
Regardless of the parents, who from the speakers, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and a wedding in addition to the National Committee, I too had in the church.
I trust the parties failed in the worst way.
That's why I was deleted from the ranks of its candidates.
But it wasn't enough!
I had two children baptized, and even his mother when she died, I managed a church funeral, though this was a former member of the party.
I show all this negative attitude to the party leadership.
If you read only the Chief's personnel manager, tapping the table with pencils punctuated by silence.
Everyone was staring at me and I wish I was somewhere far, far away.
I kept repeating to himself "communists, communists - SUPERMEN - supermen." what have I got myself into?
Why am I not remained at blacksmiths?
Repair switches as I can without some crappy clearances.
But now?
Railway official career over before it began.
To return to the squad?
I don't think so, I'm sure the chief me out for an hour.
"comrade, how were you checked here in the present tense silence comrade?" the chief issue on a cadre.
Well, according to the report from previous employment.
You have him here?
It was obviously not kádrovákovi twice.
Beads of sweat on the forehead, blinking nervously, as if he himself was prověřovaný.
The chief nodded and handed a piece of paper.
"well," the chief said with a hint of joviality, but which was often a precursor of a storm.
At first glance, nothing but praise well-taught, graduated with honors from college, he worked as a locksmith piecework, filling in the standard, on average, a hundred and twenty percent.
But that's missing the point.
Where did you get that reference, comrade? "turned again to a cadre, who felt that it kind of starts to turn against him and that he would not even be very soon maybe kádrovákem.
The comrade, gave it to me at roll call.
It was enough for you?
"well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to the crew," the cadre.
And there are opinions not required, his was, somehow, so I gave it to a folder.
"so at inclusion in the technical functions that could give you a piece of paper," the chief said.
Cadre blinking nervously and decided to answer.
"never mind, we'll discuss it later," business chief and kádrovákovi looked relieved.
For now, take it.
"what's the matter with you, comrade?" the Chief turned to me again.
Suddenly my vyká, so it's over!
In the eyes of my vision faded, me that scalding hot.
Burst of remorse and accusations, and I knew it was the ugliest creature on earth that does not deserve the slightest mercy.
By planting an incomplete report that I misled comrade cadre examiner, while I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I received it from a cadre at the factory.
I also antisocialistický element, which at the time of real socialism supports the building of the deserts of religious obscurantism, ba, even participate in them.
That, that was a lot of everything that I've committed, or maybe even commit and silently prayed for it to end.
I didn't care.
It didn't matter that mechanizátora crawling out of my place.
I didn't care, they'll take me the pick.
It is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, which I was in the eyes of Comrade Chief.
"that's enough, sir," said the party chairman and chief's levity interrupted emphatically.
This comrade made a mistake, a terrible mistake.
What mistake did right, stupid!
But he already got his punishment.
Don't forget it, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse than for a young person to him for the time that we close the door to the side!
To be opened again, he will have to prove that he's changed, that is worthy of our trust again.
An uneducated hack talking like a book.
Where did that come from?
She's so well-read or partisan parroted phrases from training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must get away from us a chance!
A chance to prove that he's changed.
And who does give it to him, if not just you, Comrade Chief?
It's your duty to this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade, support in his effort to fix!
It's your duty to the party, you'll never be rid of it.
Actually, it is also party to all of us.
This comrade must see that side of him.
That not only punishes my mother as a kindly, but that she also loves.
When the president finished, no one said a word.
No one expected such a turnaround situation.
At least I do.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief said icily in an effort to regain the initiative.
If you'd let me finish, you heard that I was going to just such a conclusion.
They all nod their heads, but it was evident that he doesn't believe a word of it.
"so I was confirmed for the function to a separate examiner basic care means," I hollered when returning to the office and then I began to cry.
Yet engineers all that in addition to the Evas were at lunch.
She listened in silence to my incoherent makeup fresh experiences and I had calmed down.
When I finished, she asked whether I have my coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, put water on the stove and preparing cups.
Meanwhile, vented about kádrováckých practices.
How one review, often full of praise, give a man in the arm, and the second, in which it is of scum, they will send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to, but a Sunday-afternoon picks, and comrades from the factory, so they didn't know where to send it to.
And our cadre?
No, he was just an old, where what he ate or drank, and so it turned out, as it turned out.
"he gets it from the old," she said mischievously.
Today, he won't like it.
Still, watch out for him, he's very vindictive.
And party chairman?
Basically far worse chief, no philanthropist.
Zero picks from having great power.
Boiled water for coffee, and then just bathed in the office was filled with the smell of coffee.
I dropped into a mug and a sugar cube, stirring potion hot in silence.
Perhaps I'm out of the woods.
Now I'm not thrown out and other reviews are in three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief me that today he won't soon forget.
It came out in the anthology writers on the track II EPICs in publishing
The symbol of the municipality came to life.
Pinwheel bicycle over chlumem spinning again.
To see them from far away, because it is placed at fifteen meters tall flagpole.
People from a wide area they call him "the fan Chlum".
For the municipality to 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the municipality acquired natives to celebrate the reunion in 2010.
"we're pulling back then about character and the character of Course fan we wanted to have him, he knows everyone in the neighborhood," said Mayor George Masek.
Chlumské wind pump is local technical monument.
It's kind of memento: even today, recalls a time when the people here fought for good quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in centuries past was a rarity.
In 1910, when councillors decided chlumští solution which suited then until the mid 1980s.
In a village near the turnoff to excavate a číchov left seven meters deep well.
Three years later they were joined by a metal structure with a wind pump water into the reservoir, which benefited from the highest point in the village, near the church.
"the construction of the border conducted by Anthony d Moravia cargo 2 400 crowns," says Memorial inscription on the pedestrian fence construction flagpole.
The pump after a few corrections and wipeouts windmill broke down in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, then began to write a new chapter in the fight for water: that day in Chlum started to serve a new pipe.
Wind pump have remained only a dysfunctional local municipal symbol and a rarity.
The dominant online earlier this year, at a reunion preyed.
When in 2008 the chlumští decided that wind fix bike again and again to bring into operation.
One made a replica of the original wheels - reduced on average by half a metre.
The wheel was fitted on the mast, that same year, however, have to be put down.
The manufacturer of the reply did not choose the appropriate material and bike couldn't resist the wind.
After several years of dominant Odlezelské jezero resting in pieces under the roof.
From June this year, however, the wheel spins on a tall pole again.
On the occasion of the natives left reunion municipality replica wheels osadila edit him again and again and again to the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws water from the well to overflow just blind shoulder.
And over the summer it was completely cut off because the well water was scarce.
At least turned up empty.
"in the autumn then shaft the windmill from the suction pump in the basket off again," the Mayor explained Masek.
Chlum isn't the only municipality in the Czech Republic, where the wind got round to the municipal character, however, is the only member of this kind throughout the Highlands.
They have similar element in character in honor of the local technical monuments such as the Green Mountain on vyškovsku chvalkovicích and, in Kuzelov hodonínsku partutovicích fantasies, on the shelf or in the vsetínsku.
No offence, but I don't know, she admitted lafatu rock Tripoli goian.
"the fight against match I remember very well, even my goal, as all of my career," grinned the 34-year- goian at the pre-game press conference.
Then coached us georghe Hagi, it was unfortunate that we lost.
I hope I score now Sparta.
Except that this time we will not, "said goian.
This man, who has played 60 games for Romanian representation, is a key pillar of the Greek team.
A shortstop will face raids Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people coming, no hell, says about the Greek duel Spartan Hybs.
And partly, he knows what he can expect on Thursday night.
I know well, who played in the Romanian fataie Astra with my brother Luciano.
At the time, I saw all their games.
I know it's a very good striker, too, which is why he went to Sparta, said goian.
Another footballer of the Prague club name, and so came direct question, if he even knows David lafatu, top scorer in the history of the Czech League and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and lightly with a reproachful look he was aiming at Czech journalists.
Clueless expression on his face marked: "why did you ask me that?"
After a moment of silence, he said.
We saw some videos and I've noticed that a lot of Sparta plays for the team.
He's got really good players.
And lafata?
No offence, but I don't know anyone else besides fataie.
The Spartans goianovi knows it very well.
"my experience of the larger clubs, you can tell he's holding asterasu defense, it's their game," observed organizer Spartan assistant Stanislav hob.
Goian has already had the best years behind him, but boasts a very interesting football curriculum.
Their time to care for him, Borussia Dortmund - Stuttgart, both Manchester United and city, units of steauy but headed into the Italian Palermo, also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays the European cups, the Pere victory in the Czech League.
For me, it's the favorite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want the group to launch a good result.
Like Sparta, we try to win, said goian.
I'm alone Slovakian goalkeeper Tomas košickým who relish the opponent from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But for all the team I can say that we're going to fight hard.

A test of objectivity in reporting on Czech Television migrantské crisis.
Another little test of objectivity and balance of the main Czech media coverage of the refugee crisis.
This time the main broadcast news bulletins Czech television.
And how did she pass?
When they are on the faculty of journalism to teach about how they can manipulate reality, let the media may broadcast the Czech television event.
Migrantské crisis was dedicated to about 80% of the news broadcasts.
Except for the first minute, when informed about the riots on Thu srbsko-maďarské border and attacks on police officers are euphemistically called migrants they have run out of patience - they threw rocks and attacked with metal bars), driving the current promigrantská propaganda - the names of each story for you to judge.
Criticism of non-governmental organisations - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticise the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in Czech school - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but as a chance.
Wandering refugees - Thu consistently used expressions a runner or a runaway and not a migrant.
What's striking is mostly that Thu ilustračních used consistently in the images and only images of small children and women.
Yet the same broadcast itself stated that, of the migrants apprehended in the Czech Republic is 80% men.
Summary: mostly propaganda, which is unprecedented from communist agitek.
I have to say, as a former journalist colleagues to shame.
Ecology in practice.
When I used to be able to place concrete building, I soon ceased to be the sole inhabitant.
I moved in on a Formica toilet roaches.
Domestic Silverfish, insects with incomplete metamorphosis, i.e., the transition from neprodělávající caterpillars on the beetle and cub looks like an adult, it's just a small and gradually rising.
I was disgusting and I took the opportunity to destroy them.
First, manually and chemically later.
Socialist drugstore at their disposal to provide a sort of blue crystals.
I think it was called Zyklon-B.
Or something else?
It is, however, successfully destroyed.
Later I handled it with the Pharaohs.
A box with a sort of juvenalizátorem, who brought the ants to the nest, and then he allowed the queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went on, I became the object of my admiration and I am increasingly leaning towards the view that they have the same right to life as we humans.
Plus I took from the experience of life, that the interference in the ecosystem does not lead to success and a pest can replace the other.
True in fleas and bedbugs would probably not hesitate to worsen some karma by killing them.
At the new location with a partner we agreed that if we're not roaches crawling on his neck, let them eat in peace, renegade skin flakes, some invisible eyelashes and the like.
Their peaceful existence after time broke the spider.
It was the usual kind of pokoutníka, a long-time dwelt on the ceiling.
We should consider that the lives of the occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only added to comfort us.
Because we lived for several years, we found that the mainly feed on rybenkami and that their number was probably kept on constructing únosném condition.
Regular intimate contact with each need done, we discovered that it's a female.
We were witnessing romantic courtship with a partner about one-third less, how carefully is fraying threads of spider webs, in order not to get eaten before it reaches the hoped-for copulation.
It took about three days of moving and not to respond to our control.
Under the toilet bowl, where the lovemaking took place next to the female, we later found traces of dried male.
Then the spider long weeks, didn't move.
When we thought he's been in, we were amazed at the quantity of baby spiders came out, hanging around in her neighborhood.
Soon disappeared.
The work of your mother and were eaten, the work of scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
If she went somewhere else or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, popped back up on the ceiling.
True, slightly smaller, probably the daughter praobyvatelky toilet.
From the ceiling while warily watching our behaviour and transfer under the toilet bowl calculated our non-aggression as friendship.
The numbers somewhat seeding rybenek decreased again and a spider in his normal activities to ensure the food.
A whole year to our ecosystem.
Our daughter between outgrown the use of pot was a disgrace.
So far we have tolerated it, but eternal spilling its contents to us anymore.
We exhorted her harder still to use the toilet.
The daughter, however, found an excuse for maintaining the habit in that spider, which saw very good soup.
We are talking about a spider in the house, didn't have any luck.
Crying and screaming to coerce your potty.
There was no avoiding it.
There was a moment when he had to, in the interest of the spider evolutionary shift, the boss's daughter.
It was left up to me.
Was whisked into a glass and banished from the balcony into the garden.
I was saying goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt after so long living nasty, as if I throw out a relative.
We assumed that the roaches will appear more often and they'll multiply exponentially.
Wonder of wonders, a week or two, we wasn't there.
I began to speculate on the cause.
I was wondering if there's a spider after model ants somehow grown that the toilet is not so favourable environment for their existence as we thought.
But then there were the first pieces of average size, and swarmed again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their link with the spider must have been the cause, when you see him, he's hiding in some other place, and that the danger to them from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some sort of telepathic link with his predator and its rapid disappearance triggered an alarm response in them.
The more that have no illusions about their vision.
Some light showed that shyness, but would respond to hand-waving or quick movements, no.
My daughter goes to the toilet regularly.
I think you forgot the chamber pot.
Only attract some spider again.
I've got his wish into the ether and hope for me after the execution, Jeanne.
Otherwise we would have to use the Cyclone b.
The ten quotes Albert Einstein, which enriched the world.
Statements by brilliant scientists of the last century, apparently humanity never cease to fascinate.
He managed to dive so deeply into everything, that was always a product of amazing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the greatest scientists of all time.
In particular, the awareness of people walked in his special and general theory of relativity, which describes the universe so far, preferably in its gigantic proportions.
Nor can we overlook his clarification fotoefektu kvantování or thought of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the mere hodnoty and system expertise for many popular theory of relativity is so convoluted that for intimate acquaintance prefers simple analogies.
It's not easy, however.
Of course it wouldn't be Albert Einstein, if even on this brilliantly found a simplified explanation: an hour in the vicinity of your nice seems just a minute; a minute in hot oven an hour - and it seems that's relativity.
I took the liberty of his famous quotes across the Pleiades choose these ten, which literally mesmerized me.
Intelligent people are trying to solve problems, genius is trying to do.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
The first one I'm not so sure.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove that I was right.
However, the only time can prove that I was wrong.
But it's a sad time, when it is easier to disintegrate an atom than to destroy prejudices.
If the mess on the table reflects the clutter in the mind, then what reflects the empty table?
I don't know, what will the fight World War Three, but in the fourth it will be with sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect him.
It is dangerous to know little and know many too.
If I had had an hour to tackle the problem, which would save my life, I spent 40 minutes in his studio, 15 minutes and 5 minutes of his analysis, his solutions.
The hardest thing in the world to understand the income tax.
Finally, I cannot forbear to Einstein's definition of success: the formula for success, and considering the formula a = x + y + z, where x is y and the rest of the work, is to hold your tongue.
The new and modern.
Hospital waiting in Zlín Region changes for 1.5 billion.
"it's an accomplishment, considering that all this year with all four holds in the black," said Captain Stanislav who was with.
Total profit in district facilities at this moment is about 32 million crowns.
The shares are mostly higher reimbursement from insurance companies, which are as favourable for this year.
This really shows that after years of poor hospital can finally afford a bigger investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín Uherské Hradiště and Shepperton, it makes brewing to the edifice, which together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
A long period of time, especially when we're buying appliances, has ended.
Now we have to build new buildings, because without them, the high-end health plans can do, for health reasons, the Regional Deputy Petr Nečas.
Looking forward to the changes in all hospitals.
Clients come to hospitals next year.
Vsetín now choose the supplier of a new internal pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
In Kroměříž have scheduled an addition of dialysis.
Uherske Hradiste wants an open central pavilion this year to build a medical, approximately 200 million.
And zlínskou baťovu hospital waiting the long-delayed construction of new central income and medical ward, which will need to be three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases it is the fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"for the whole region, patients and doctors, it's an extremely important step," she said, for example, to build the hospital director Vera prousková vsetínské medical ward.
A five-story building there is supposed to be finished in about two years and offer comfort and neurology, medical equipment for dialysis, new ambulances, beds, and intensive care unit.
Convenience for patients.
The changes that will significantly affect patients, mainly of all regions.
The new building will replace those in which, for example, many patients lying on the floor of one room, must have only one bathroom, beds are nepolohovatelné, leaking windows and paramedics do not have adequate conditions for work.
"for example, our interna was built 35 years ago and now their life is on the line," pointed out while the hospital director Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years, because it will replace the seven-storey modern building connected to emergency room overhang.
Physicians and patients will be in one place all the emergency ward, plus in the new spaces.
The same model already has a half-finished Uherske Hradiste.
Central reception and standing within three years will be added to the main ward.
"we pay for construction of the loan, and partly out of its own resources," explained the director Peter Brewer.
It was this hospital's own funding as the only one in the country can afford.
He still has the highest profit and loss are not even two years ago, when the hospital was dealing with the necessary Zlínský almost dvousetmilionovou loss.
"we have good contracts with insurance companies, an excellent performance, increasing revenues and effectively manage costs in the entire hospital," named vajdák Rudolf, who is in charge of the economy.
Improvements to be bolstered and patients kroměřížské hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years will go to repairs, new gadgets, and reconstruction up to half a billion crowns.
This year, he's already done the repair station anchor, then begin rehabilitation of dialysis, or the construction of a new building for an mri.

Nobody explained how I should be adopted to keep refugees in the country, if they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan CHOVANEC (ČSSD) after negotiations with their European colleagues complain that the Czech Republic is pushing other States to adopt quotas to redistribute refugees, but refuse any discussion.
He also observes that, so far, no one has explained to him how he should keep the allocated refugees in the Czech Republic, when we just don't want to live.
"we didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted to make the quotas were deleted from the final text," said inmate journalists.
More specifically, can you describe the position, had come to the meeting of interior ministers of the European Union and abroad?
We disagree with the mandatory quotas as a system that simply won't work.
We can't talk about migrants like bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings which have some vision, going somewhere, they got some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues, how we're able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States, if redistribuovali.
We can't imagine it.
We didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted to make the quotas were deleted from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hot spots, namely registrars, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we don't have any problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we say that this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Not long ago we talked about forty thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep those people on territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people who pass through us, wants to go to Germany.
Almost nobody wants to us, we simply don't know how to keep them here.
They have the ambition to go to us other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as the destination country, gaining fireman today with us, but the interest of the people of this, therefore the waves of migration from Syria and other countries is approaching, close to zero.
You've mentioned that to us, but they don't even want refugees actually fifteen hundred people we've already committed to take.
Would it not be possible to adopt more of them in this way?
We have pledged to accept 1500 people, but with the condition.
We said: the functional hot spots, border control, military operation.
Even in those 1500 regards that comes 1100 people settle asylum procedure.
They will come to our detention facility, and we will treat them the same as those that we captured.
The big question is, and we are about to debate with Europe if we can detain people, who will be registered in Italy and Greece, possibly in Hungary.
Because Europe is acting to it so that if they have the registration, they can't be detained.
That means, with registration will come to our territory, and if it is an agreement which is not yet, it may be that even those 1100 cannot hold on the territory of the Czech Republic and they after coming in again to leave Germany.
If we can contain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, asylum procedure, we will deal with them.
Should the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, so nearly 98 percent, according to European statistics, gaining international protection.
Then they get the documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think that these people end up once again in the target countries.
Then there's four hundred people přesídlovat.
It is the second project, which is still there, and the progress we've made solely in that debate with churches, the possibility that they could help get them jobs, housing and so on.
But it is a very long haul.
You said that at a meeting of Ministers with us the other States were not willing to discuss.
But it's not so that the Czech Republic just refuses to quotas, but offers no solidarity step, which could unlock the discussion here?
And what exactly is it you think solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany will cast an incentive that all migrants from Syria so they can have access to them, the news spread in the hours after the camps all over Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages the next migration wave, which is going to Germany, because we just don't want to.
We think that the protection of external borders - just you discourage migration waves, to help those in need, and to separate economic migrants.
Definitely let them know that they have a chance.
Just last year, came to Germany to fifty thousand Kosovars.
Safe from Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of that State, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor ’ s office.
If we managed to separate them and not accepting or receiving only according to the needs of the economies, so would the fifty percent of what social systems in vain for them today, they could go to the refugees.
On the first day when Germany introduced the checks bounced, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic.
Now it's 80, the first day it was twelve.
Where it has to happen for border controls tightened?
We were scared in the capture of hundreds of people.
These are numbers that we manage.
We still have a few hundred vacancies in land-based detention facilities.
Of course all the people that hold them, we'll be back within seven days of Austria.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the ones who us those people take, with Hungary's complicated and Greeks - it's completely pointless story.
Where is the tipping point?
It would have to be a grand a day?
I think it would have to be perhaps several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two to three consecutive days we will run out of capacity, enough contingency plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately called an emergency government.
He is very concerned about the whole thing, we're several times a day in telephone contact.
If this is the situation, the government can sit and de facto one would immediately order the army decided to reinforce the police, say customs administration, possibly about a prison service.
The extreme option is a state of emergency, which now in some places declared Hungary?
I think it can't happen to us this far.
Remember that our position is different, we are the national state within Europe, Schengen border we have only, and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen in order for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, rather suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the flow of migration to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct path to Austria.
The Czech Republic that would have offended very marginally, at all.
Slavia paid off at the last moment, a large part of the debt.
He's trying to avoid bankruptcy.
Football Slavia pay debts.
Even footballers get their money.
Slavia football stood for the first time on Tuesday for insolvency proceedings before the Court.
Almost three months after her for roughly 20 million kroner, the company applied for online services from Pacific countries of Samoa.
Attorney Susan vamps Mládková tried to judge Michael wenzlovou within several hours to convince them that he has over slavií bankruptcy.
And, needless to say, had the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the week before the new owner vamps became a big Chinese industries and investment group also cefc and Czech billionaire Jiri šimáně.
Obviously, since the new owners came in the club money, at the last minute.
It proves even before Tuesday's judicial conduct observations vamps - vršovický club Monday, just a day before the hearing in court, sent owed tens of millions of crowns.
"everything was between September 11 and 15 September paid," stated attorney Mládková vamps.
Slavia, who paid for that?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Czech or Slovak exreprezentantovi Milano Ivan záložníkovi Maria ličkovi.
Slavia also has paid the agent Alexander losenickemu.
On Friday the club pay the outstanding fees of Prague 10.
Part of the insolvency proceedings remain de facto only claims that the Abrahamic vamps.
Under either club commitments given, or not at all of them lead litigation.
However, we are prepared in the event of failure of those disputes the amount to pay.
"we have the necessary funds in a bank account, which can produce a statement of account," she told Judge Advocate Mládková.
"everything is paid in arrears," she said, and added that Mládková unpaid or disputed are the only commitments.
It is also certain that the judge decides in the next few days and the procedure will continue.
Match gave three weeks to send detailed evidence that actually paid the debts.
Subsequently, there will be an evaluation of all the evidence.
We can therefore expect the decision first in November.
The judge ordered the continuation of negotiations on November 3.
The decision, however, she will not fall at this meeting, but in writing to him.

Bianca could build so as to not failing.
But it would cost about half a billion more, says an expert from a firm that was designing tunnel.
Bianca could imbue even safer, says an expert.
Blanka tunnel complex could be built so as to avoid two busts of soil in Prague, says the production company director tree-man satra, which is the main tunnel, designer Alexander butovič.
It said Wednesday afternoon in the journalistic search the tunnel.
According to him, but that would be about half a billion kroner more expensive.
Drivers opens on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between cost and security.
"the tunnel could make safer, but the costs are growing exponentially," said butovič.
Conditions in the park have been under him after the same thing all the time, yet the country collapsed just a few steps from where he began to forge a safer and more careful method.
"if this measure was used about 500 meters before the tunnel would have been about half a billion more expensive," stated butovič.
Blanka tunnel during the construction failed three times.
Twice, in 2008, there was a crater in the park, in 2010, fell to the ground at the Culture Ministry in Prague 6.
According to company director George Metrostav bělohlava tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, EURO weekly said.
The structure was intended for the State 17 billion crowns.
When we add in the VAT, which popped up twice for the construction period, of the 17 billion have twenty-one.
Add to that a technology buyouts of land and engineering activities, indexation and similar items, it's 29 billion, which is no longer from the 37 back that far, said Bělohlav
That anyone ordered and paid for it.

FedEx profits mixed, reduce the fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in full-year profit forecasts because of low demand for freight and higher costs for the inland division.
The company also stated that the holiday is planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers.
In this period last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Shares of the company decreased by about 2.5 percent in trading předtržním 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx indicates that expects earnings between $$10,90 V5 and for the fiscal year, which ends next May, which represents a decrease of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
A reduced outlook comes despite an increase in interest rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will take effect in January 4, and higher bonuses for ground transport heavy or big packages, which start in November.
The company stated that it still expects profit growth compared with the previous year because of cost reductions, higher revenue, and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "showed a solid performance despite a weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing industry and global trade."
Holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rivalská ups claimed that he plans to hire 90 000 to 95 000 workers extra, which is probably just as they hired last year.
In the quarter, which ended in August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is about 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share amounted to $probable, which is less than the $2.44 per share, which was predicted the 12 analysts Zacks investment research.
Sales increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by the downturn in recent years priority international shipping, which caused revenue in its express unit stagnated.
But the boom in online shopping, FedEx results boost ground troops.
The Inland Revenue in the last quarter rose by about 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same for larger packages and higher prices for their own insurance.
The express unit recorded a higher income due to the higher base rates, while profit decreased in the cargo trade because of higher prices for labour.
Předtržním in about an hour before the opening of trading, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
Ended Tuesday with a decrease of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of 11 June.
At its hottest meetings in years, lawmakers this week, the Federal Reserve will spend two days at 27 feet long and Honduran mahogany table will determine whether, after almost ten years the time has come to increase the key interest rate.
Towering above them at one end of the central bank of marquetry, two-story conference room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The central bank has the dual charge of the American Congress: maximize employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be x-faktorem in too close to the predictable decision, which is to be announced on Thursday, about whether the US economy is ready to run in the decommissioning of the unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rate in place since the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows solid growth of the economy, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the fed already cautious about adding to volatility by increasing its benchmark federal funds rate — and that's nothing more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"it is clear that the labour market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"but I think they were just looking for an excuse to not hiking rates, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient reason to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed does, which in itself is causing nervousness on the financial markets.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Blomberg had anticipated an increase in rates this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed would delay a key indicator of business, with only about 30% chance of an increase.
That would have pointed to a decline in the stock market, in the event that the Fed will raise rates only if politicians promise that softens the slump is a further increase in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped about 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599,85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that the Fed will delay rate politicians this week in peace, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's capital markets research group.
"it would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates," It states.
If it's the politicians, the Fed did, "they would have to go to the extreme in its programme Declaration and hold hands in the financial markets, not to panic."
Other experts said that an increase in rates would have calmed financial markets, because it would remove the uncertainty of how the Fed will proceed.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the Fed is on track to increase rates by 0.25 of a percentage point this month, the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions, which would confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that through the spring and early summer is expected to increase rates this year, despite the Liberals complaint that there is a need for more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed in August, the job market this year, recorded solid growth.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
And even though inflation remains below the Central Bank's annual 2% target, the politicians, the Fed maintains that the main reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.
"the economy can cope with higher rates and needs is, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to struggle at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped to a record 16% below its value in May, when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy dragging down global growth.
The market rebounded somewhat in this months ago and now only the Dow loses nearly 10% from the peak in May.
The Fed ’ s policy makers the turbulent situation on the market adds a complex calculus, when to start raising interest rates.
"in the absence of that, what happened to the financial markets, and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. oliner, senior researcher, UCLA ziman center for real estate and a former official of the Fed.
Now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"there's a lot of uncertainty about what impact it will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data on which to rely on for recent developments in China," oliner said.
The health of the global economy is one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically shouldn't be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed became the monetary authority all over the world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years was enormous.
The mere suggestion of the then chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013, that the Fed could "taper" its monetary expansion in the market, triggered spasms throughout the world.
In a world where the markets and the economy are still linked more closely, it can be expected that Fed officials also are watching developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central bankers and experts, the better to be able to read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary karabell, head of Global Strategy for envestnet bohatství-management Company Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "the Fed has history with exaggerated movements in financial markets, which seem inconsistent with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, who pushed tariff increases in 1998-99, cited as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point during three meetings "identifiable, despite the limited impact on growth in the US," said Lacker.
A year later, Fed officials turned these cuts.
The Fed should prioritise financial stability concerns only during the Great Depression, as was the market meltdown of 2008, said Adam Posen, a former member of the board with setting rates by the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil to even come close to this level, said.
"you don't want to be in a situation of fear of growth rates, because markets are upset," said Posen, president of Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think he should get on top.

Speed on motorways stays the same.
Acceleration to 150 km / h, was rejected by the House of Representatives.
On selected sections of motorway in favourable conditions, it will not be possible to increase the speed limit to 150 km / h.
So the House of Representatives decided on Tuesday, when she stepped on the amendment of the Senate, which refused to increase speed.
Amendments to the law on the roads so now heads to the President.
President Milos Zeman, in late April, said that the law would allow the speed of ninety vetoed.
He was also against an increase in transport minister dan ťok (for Yes), under which the Czech Highway network is not designed for such a speed.
On the Tuesday before ťok Members supported the Senate version of the bill.
The amendment will allow approved now, in line with the original government proposal to increase speeds from 90 to 110 miles an hour on selected roads, first class, in particular the dual carriageways.
Congress has extended this first option on the highway, on which you could ride in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km / h, but the Senate rejected it.
Members now on his proposal.
Senators with the approval of the Minister of Transport from the novels also has removed the traffic police have the last word in adjusting local roads, they take care of the municipalities.
A Senate version, which was approved by the House of Commons, counts with the plumbing, wiring, plumbing or public lighting it was possible to impose lengthwise beneath the surface of roads.
It would save a community buy-out.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of roadside vegetation along the local roads, regardless of the owner of the property.
The novella has also help improve the protection and management of roads to facilitate municipalities odtaženými vehicles to which the owners responsibility.
Newly municipalities would be able to sell the vehicles at carted within six months after the notification about a tow their owners come forward.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit cargo through its territory after the second and third class roads under threat of fines for forwarding companies.
The amendments also removed the possibility to introduce electronic highway sign instead of the previous paper, which will apply after 1 January of next year.
According to the government, it saves money for the introduction of an electronic system.

For overpriced baby shower in 10 years.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced project the baby shower.
The police in this case to prosecute and assemblywoman Susan kailovou (ČSSD), the Chamber of Deputies but not her.

Then the contract should entrust the city Administrator and applied only to the competition, which the company darothore then awarded the contract to the city council.
The city paid off at least a million extra.
Both led the charge to ensure company darothore for awarding public contracts on the staging of the baby shower in Ústí nad Labem long-term and coordinated at least acted contrary to the requirement for the procedure, with due care, says the prosecutor.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that the company subsequently darothore after obtaining that contracts be cleared Usti nad Labem in the implementation of the action of the baby shower award, which will be compared to the fair value of the services actually provided disproportionately inflated.
In three years, according to the file, the company behind the project collected more than five million crowns.
The city eventually paid off just one part, roughly 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
According to the report by the amount paid was at least a million crowns overpriced.
Mandík earlier refused any breach of the law.
I didn't commit any offence, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this contrived story, said earlier that the former mayor of the city under his leadership just piggybacked on a similar project of years past.
In the years 2008 to 2010 event the agency Roxy II.

Hungarian police officers allegedly released the dog to a refugee.
Then they made journalists delete record.
He said the police at the Hungarian border with Serbia briefly detained AP cameraman and made him delete record, on which a police dog allegedly knocked down a fugitive.
But the Hungarian Government denies this charge.
The alleged incident happened Saturday night, when AP cameraman filming Luca Muzi, migrants across the cornfield near the Hungarian border town of Röszke crossing with Serbia.
Police officers stepped in against the refugees and one of them left a Syrian attack dog with a basket on his snout.
Dog man who shouted, "please, please, please, I'm a runner," he claims the men.
That all men filming, he noticed one of the officers and wouldn't let him leave.
The Journalist then could no longer even make a phone call to his superiors, even colleagues at the scene.
The officers were taken to a dark place muziho at registration centres for refugees and asked him to show them what has uploaded.
Then ordered him to erase the footage.
Men came about as the result of the two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger, because the dogs were nearby.
The AP sent a letter of protest to the spokesman zoltánu Kovács, the Hungarian Government.
The behaviour of cops in it as unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risk of physical violence and we won't have to worry that the government will destroy the material obtained legally.
Kovács, relying on the police report questioned muziho narration of the events.
He said, "the police just wanted to show them the journalist, whether they are on some shots, to which they are entitled.
When they found out that they are not there, delete anything they didn't force him.
"dogs may bark - they are trained to odstrašovali and a little fierce, but not with certainty," says Kovacs.
Unpredictable Champions League.
A win for city will kick us, believes Juventus
"it's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of the domestic city.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team created a lot of chances, but we had football boots the ball longer we.
"the cause of defeat, not in the tactics of Juventus just scored two beautiful goals a game," said Pellegrini, whose team cashed in competitive matches after long 636 minutes.
Last season's runner-up Juventus were mutual encounter exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian league as the defending champion only has a point and with the score 2: 4, includes up to 16th place in the table.
That is also why the turnover at Etihad stadium was the big surprise.
"this win will help us mentally, kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Mestre, who had to deal with losing before the new year - three mainstays of Italy, téveze and Vidal.
In Manchester, is blocking pogba mandžukič and Morata.
"it is so, this victory is very important, perhaps thanks to him we're going on a winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the offensive phase.
This result you my players deserve.
"before our balancing goal we could cash in contrast to 0: 2, but (No hold us up," said coach goaltender buffona Mestre.
"we burned several good chances," sorry Yayu tourého midfield, city.
We need to take the experience of the Champions League and try for a better outcome next time.
Goodbye Angela, goodbye old Germany II.
Before we continue on the question of immigrants, we should recognize that all this media frenzy around is managed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
And so let us pause for a moment.
Today news and media are full of babies, which are at the hands of their parents dusty roads exodus.
And that raises in a man - therefore in European man - automatic guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't come here just desperate children, notice on the shots landing boats to the Greek islands, babies on them is not so much to see!
Well, the last time us somehow disappeared from TV pictures of ships headed for lampedusu refugees before the French border near Menton, whose beautiful promenade of thousands of young men.
Largely young black men.
And also vanished pictures from Calais, where these brown and black men are waiting, whether they manage to get through the tunnel under the English Channel.
I think he's unmoved.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian Church Eritreans somehow didn't do the inhabitants of Europe on a particular impression.
Too much of it stuck falseness.
So when it comes to the quota for refugees, then somehow holding out that it's not just the unfortunate children from Syria, but also about the styling - for older: vyfešákované fashionably - young men.
The musculature of which look like they've just climbed out of a gym.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish part of Cyprus - a Muslim - we lay on a private beach Hotel.
Regardless, that was a private beach, suddenly came to a large group of cars.
But no ham.
And young black men emerged.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years ago.
They went to the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes in hand, how else, smartphones.
It's a private beach, and caring staff - Turks, Muslims! - they are obviously worried.
Occupied all the deckchairs.
Who was on it and was in the sea, he was unlucky.
They were dressed as rapperského from American film.
Caps on their heads with a fingernail, white and colored Adidas shoes on her feet.
Besieged the local beach bar and feasting.
Occupied tables around, stuff sitting next to brown and white guests bar - Read it Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers with children, fleeing the dining terrace somewhere in peace.
Incoming Smoketown drank beer straight from třetinek sitcoms from the US - how?! - on the beach, they threw empty bottles around.
Constantly shouting loudly at each other.
In English, of course, it was.
Then they also drink wine straight from the bottle.
They jumped in the hotel swimming pool - in designer swimsuits, particularly the young ladies - in the water, screamed and yelled, mothers with children and pensioners ran away and half an hour later, he was on the beach or pool neither nečerný guest.
They all disappeared.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter told me tonight under his breath: "did you see that sweetie, what they wore?"
"yeah," I said.
"well, it certainly wouldn't work," said the waiter.
I thought: "I know, they all had a massive gold chains around their necks.
And one was on my neck like a massive cross of gold.
And women were as jewelry store.
"those are drug smugglers?" I asked.
"well, you saw how drinking," the waiter said.
Party drugs, even non-users.
They smuggle you something completely different.
So it was clear to me what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105 still for me, it wasn't so important.
I had no idea what would follow.
But the Secret Service and top politicians ought to be the first to know.
I don't know.
To Europe in that time has about 1.5 million immigrants.
And they go and they come and they go.
Today it turns out that the main problem of the European Union, is that politicians, intellectuals and totalitně-politicko-korektní like them linked to lobbying and economically important groups in Europe have the greatest power.
Germany and its politicians - now publicly accepted the main power in Europe - they lie, lie and lie - but not only them, the EU also tiptoe and TV, including our own.
For example, the recent television images of excited about welcoming refugees in Germany are at the level of a Moscow television images of August 1968.
Of course, the station was a few sluníčkářů, but mainly - staroněmečtí - Muslims greeted her counterpart.
The long weeks of blather on the news on Czech TV, according to some research, as they are almost all Germans for the arrival of immigrants.
Of course, who was only a few days in Germany, he knows it's a lie.
Which confirm other information.
For example, the famous poll organized Ard public television companies - English Association of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to Ard wanted a week ago, more than 50% of Germans accept more refugees.
It also meldovaly our TV.
The next day, however, what snapped in Germany: in the article that anketním vote showed that 94.5 percent of Germans want no more immigrants - votes were attended by 67 000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, five years ago, said: "our efforts towards ́multi-kulti ́společnost totally failed."
Then she said: "Germany has given up the fight for a multicultural society."
"all efforts to have failed spectacularly such coexistence."
In the country where they live four million Muslims, according to her it's sloppy strategy which enabled people from different cultural environments to live side by side without integrate live here with us today and we've been deluding ourselves for some time, that one day they will disappear again.
But that's not reality.
A multicultural approach where we say we just live happily side by side, so this approach has failed.
Completely failed.
But even Merkel probably doesn't have the strength to go against powerful Germany and Europe and especially against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euroněmec Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, MP for the SPD in Parliament ’ s, the one who allegedly doesn't even have a high school diploma - Yes, it's the same in the EU Parliament, Berlusconi said he could from minutes to play in the concentration camp guards - again, as shown.
It seems, especially under the impression the last statements of German politicians that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
You'll note that except for some, most European politicians, statesmen, these statements does not support countries that were victims of Nazism, are horrified.
What's happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who, at least outwardly, tried for years to cope with his terrible past aggressor and killer million?
They are right, who say that the devil is in the soul of Germany sow aggression, condescension and violence?
The chancellor Otto von Bismarck was right when all of his strength velkoněmců stopped attempts at controlling the middle of Europe?
When he said that Germany would destroy great German idea?
Probably should.
When it started shutting down, preparing for the first world war.
The idea that the Germans and velkoněmecka led Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, will probably come back in another form.
After attempting to Marxists, for example, with control of the state, we weren't, and after the failure of the GDR, in Germany, for example, on the basis of ecology, which by the way was one of the main forces of Nazism, began to develop the new German ideology.
We'd say well Sunny.
The German elites have long prevented the emergence of German nationalism, and so left alone all these fighters against the atom, enthusiasts looking for Paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi password our forest must live.
To satisfy restless young people everywhere in the world they want to do something different and better, to fully side with the warriors against the planet stopped warming, nuclear power plants, etc.
And have forgotten that in this current there is also strongly anti-Semitic - so-called propalestinský - and current antislovanský criminalising all Slavs difficult scum - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after Parents, a Jew, was mainly German Nationalist.
And also, as shown by the latest statements by Schulze and German minstrů openly defying threatening eastern states, idea leader of Germany.
That must be without obey.
Otherwise woe betide you!
And if we bring that into it that immigrants are very suggestible ABC1, we have what we have.
And it is, as always, especially the German capital and who is comfortable on that Germany actually via banks and Union control most of the States of Europe.
Pseudovíra sluníčkářů Germans first introduced into the swamps and ekologismu multiklturalismu and brought home to them today and maybe even bring millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by the siren voices, soon to hit the wall of reality, which Merkel wants to see, and they begin to rebel.
Only Germany can once again threaten its neighbors by force, can once again part of their population - but that still seems a minor part of the mind gets addled - ideologically, but eventually it catches up with the reality, as always.
Germany will burn again?
Muslim quarters already burning.
What does the German Government starts Germans, public protests against the incoming Islamists?
Who will come to the aid of Muslims have long been living in Germany, but certainly not asimilovaní, to local customs and laws?
What does the German Government, to get into a fight, the incoming Islamo-fascists hyphenated Muslims and Germans fear the Islamisation of their country?
What does that do to the Germans, and even with Germany, once they were up, people who will loudly and publicly to protest against a new Muslim euro-nadčlověku?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict, which triggered in Europe by promoting sluníčkářské ideology, therefore, elitist ideology and essentially totalitarian, and their greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the omission of democratic behaviour towards the Germans and all third-rate disobedient and rebellious Eastern neighbours it can't turn out well.
Completion of tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the pushy salesmen: scare them to death.
Just knock and robust knocker lashes out at you in a way that weaker nature just doesn't stand.
Animated title and will wipe you off even hardened, the journey will take away (or, rather, will) persistent seller and a living sculpture.
A pity, perhaps, that he could not get a speaker knocker and actually.

Small weeds that tolerates dry environment.

Brazilian paediatric society Rio Grande, promoting a healthy diet during lactation
Brazilian paediatric society sprs came up with a shocking way to try and convey lessons about the importance of good food to women when breastfeeding breasts by images of children viewing vymalovaného suckling from junk food.
Human breast milk is composed of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide infants all the nutrients that they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to an excess of energy requirements for pregnant women and first-time mothers is recommended to increase daily caloric intake by 500 calories a day.
However, the new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only diet that mothers should drive.
A recent study by Robert waterlandem, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet of pregnant women in fact influenced the genetic development of their children and protect them before the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, he also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affect a child's immune system.

4 people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into the crowd of protesters against the proposal for a new State Constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred in the neighborhood Tuesday night in rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad dhakal, the chief District Officer, states that the more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the police station and some threw rocks and firebombs.
Mr. dhakal states that, after the police used tear gas and shot into the air, before resorting to a rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, States.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused the high number of deaths.
This confrontation was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the madhesi ethnic group say they have set up a new Province under the proposed new constitution, and ease their political influence.
Further demonstrations have also been reported in western Nepal ethnic group of tharus, which calls for the creation of their own State.
From 10 August during violent encounters was killed at least 40 people, including 11 police officers.
When the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which was centrally managed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been going on since 2008, but legislators expedited the process after a devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers voted this week in Kathmandu, and officials of the provisions of the draft Constitution states that the new Charter should be adopted until Sunday.
Certainly, right now we can't panic.
After the loss of the ice master Litvinova you couldn't even domestic duel with hockey players of Sparta (3: 5).
Aren't you concerned about similarly disastrous entry into the big leagues as a year ago?
I hope that nothing similar will happen again.

For moderately overweight diabetics could be useful in weight-loss surgery
The benefits of weight-loss surgery for moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to tell whether the mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes are living longer after weight-loss surgery than those which receive non-surgical treatment.
"mortality data take a long time to display," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight-loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study JAMA surgery.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgery to reduce his stomach using different methods.
Reducing hunger and the limitations of the human body absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was carried out on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measure the relationship of weight relative to height, is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher suggests overweight person and people with a value of over 30 is considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
For their new study, the researchers used the min-sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data gathered from a study from 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and a gastrectomy - in therapeutic procedures Type 3 diabetes in people who were moderately obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery, according to the study, fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, those who remained BMI was not granted surgical treatment of diabetes, roughly equal to the value of 29.
Among patients with diabetes were resolved completely operations in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the treated group was compared to medicine for diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partly in only about 2 percent of patients.
It also was trigylceridů blood pressure control, and the "bad" LDL cholesterol demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient hemoglobin a1c levels in the blood, which reflects the continuous blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, noted the researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c value dropped from about 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the group treated with medication, however, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this "better glycaemic control" - reflected in improved levels of hemoglobin A1c -- did not reduce mortality rates in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. chih-cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of surgery.
After the fifth year with the bypass group lost more weight compared to the group a gastrectomy (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), reached the major downturns BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and had a greater likelihood of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent to 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not improve survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the studio stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona College of medicine-phoenix.
According to the Swedish study were obese people who underwent bariatric surgery, about 29 percent greater chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to the group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival between patients after surgery, according to Blackstone's soothing outcome for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"right here, this work is critical, because it suggests that surgery is safer in a group with lower BMI," without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, States.
Blackstone also further claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after the decline in patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting for too long, with people exhibiting the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think once you get an accumulation of these genetic changes that firmly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, already way back is really difficult.
"it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe is not able to accommodate all the refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama has addressed the question of the ongoing refugee crisis in her speech when opening the Dalai Lama centre for compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He claimed that, under current circumstances, the interest of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
Also pointed out that the answer from western European countries, whether it was in any way admirable, the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the effort of Germany and Austria in the resolution, stressed that it's only a temporary solution.
"take care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you'll have to think about a long-term solution, a way to bring real peace and real development, in particular through the education of those Muslim countries," he pointed out.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
Use of force never solve these problems, "he added.
In addressing issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also expressed on actions of George Bush after the 9 / 11 terrorist attack, and claim that "violent US response uncontrollable chain of events.
After 9 / 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem, not the violent path.
I know that his motives were good, but he used his strength and create unexpected consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.
A fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested sanitation reagent for the last 4 years
Poison control centres around the United States reported nearly 400-procentní increase since 2010 in the number of children up to 12 years, which swallowed the highly alcoholic sanitation agent, according to the Poison Center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of ingestion of sanitation for children up to 12 years, which were reported to poison control centers increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"kids are getting these products more often and, unfortunately, there is a percentage of children that need to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitation means deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
The YouTube video shows teenage drinking means sanitation due to cheap fuss.
The teenagers reportedly sanitation means mixed with Mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be drawn to the attractive scent of appeal.
"kids think that it could hurt them," said Lopez.
Plenty of more attractive (two sanitation funds) are those which are parfémovány.
Sanitation resources available are scented with strawberries or oranges, grapefruit, which are very tempting for children.
Sanitation device contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children can mean a few sips of alcohol poisoning.
"this is a highly concentrated alcohol," he told Fox 4 in Kansas City, the medical director of the poison control center at the University of Kansas hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
They wouldn't let you drink whiskey too just lying around, but people these sanitation means they let out, and when the kids get to them, it's a quick trip to the consumption of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a 6-year-old girl, who recently took four gulps in school when sanitation agents with the scent of strawberries and was rushed to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was twice the .179, which is considered the threshold for drunk in an adult, according to Dr Chris ritcheyho, emergency doctor who took care of her in the Gwinnett medical center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah slurred words and she wasn't able to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital on for any signs of brain trauma, because a girl for alcohol fell and hit her head, Ritchey points out.
"it was very scary," said Scott, the mother of CNN ortoria nhaijah.
It could be fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or arrange for them to be sanitation means out of reach of children.
Outside of alcohol poisoning were some sanitation resources associated with death.
In 2013, two women died from Ontario after swallowing the sanitation of the device, which contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The medics believed that the product contains methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January three fourth year students in northern New York planned to poison their "bad" teachers the stationing of antibacterial products around the room, "according to the police report.
The teacher is extremely allergic to sanitation means and banned their presence in the room.
Police foiled the plan as "innocent chit-chat," and referred to the school district, discipline

Why was I witnessed the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I'll watch the killing of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't come to that, I'll sit in the viewing gallery in the Oklahoma State Prison death chamber and see Richard glossipa, who will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me if I was one of the four officials who will witness his death.
As soon as I received the invitation in January through his best friend and even though I was so shocked, I agreed.
As the days get closer, I'm starting to get worried.
Why do it then?
I accepted the invitation, because I think that's a good way to be able to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would have offered me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because it is often more applications than positions, the morbid lotteries decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, will monitor the entire execution dispassionately.
I can't do it.
I will sit alongside Richard glossipa's closest friends, and I've developed a special connection to him through phone calls a month and one of two and a half hour visit.
I like this guy.
Often we laugh when we talk.
Prison service says he cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notepad and won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, I'm compromising his impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he would like that, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "it could formulate better," but still thinks that what I do is wrong.
Richard glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if it did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him that I may at any time remove from the witness list.
But he wants an international journalist who will be on site ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help practices against the death penalty.
Kim bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
If you want to know more information about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I created.
Here again, I will not repeat all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van treese would make him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that the murder is innocent.
I absolutely believe that it had not provided sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion the execution is bad.
And from this perspective, I'll just follow his death.
I can't say that I'll be really objective.
For this purpose, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is to experience what it's like to see a man I like, to die a meaningless death.
The man escaped from the canning river after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after a man pulled from the canning River.
Bet the man from petrhu that runs the police, came out after he got into the shallow, muddy water just feet from the officers, who tried to persuade him gently back to shore.
Police from Canning Vale was summoned over the incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them across the river unikem Canning.
But he didn't get far.
"he was standing in the water and repeated," I'm not going out just to take me, "said Sergeant shandell castledine.
Constable Lachlan perhavec just didn't want to get wet uniform, so tried to use safer that police tactics and negotiation. "
"sometimes people do funny things when trying to escape," said castledine.

Peter Moody says organisers tried to spy on him and risk the closure of plants
Peter Moody accused racing Victoria stewards that he tried to get a spy into the stable last year and threatened to stop racing.
He focused on the organiser and racing Victoria integrity department and based on the belief that they have a personal campaign against him with late scratches or Lady tatai during maintenance on race day, which for him Wednesday was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in a difficult situation as regards lidarin positive swab to cobalt, which he can't explain.
He bit his tongue on charges of espionage for 18 months and didn't want it to look like a "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about the fact that I sat on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it comes out of you all at once," said Moody.
They know that it went on.
Sometimes react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
Today, I go home and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with his head up and to the owners thought they were doing their best.
If they think otherwise, then I shouldn't be the coach.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm gonna do my licences.
Previously released Moody in his interview for the racing.com bomb that the integrity department attempted to spy on him.
"eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man whom I will appoint the ruling - and offered him a job in my stables for information to find out about some of the things that are in my stables," Moody said on racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's so, they should show all your information, because in an effort to catch me utterly failed.
Robert roulston, former RVL Chairman David Moodie, the current president of RVL, and Bernard saundry, the current CEO of RVL, at that time were aware, and are aware of it even today.
I should think it becomes personal affairs?
RVL lets grow some balls and arrange to people outside the coaching position they took responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
I'm all for this industry is bad?
I'm just really, really bad for the industry?
Maybe the people here think that it does.
Maybe I need to take my licence and push me away and I have no doubt that what I'm telling them now will provide material for thought.
But I've gotten to the point, if that doesn't matter to me anymore, and I'm really sad.
I'm really sad.
I'll push them and carry the burden on them, to make the decision.
I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.
Coach's frustration levels increased with long-term investigation for cobalt including lidari and recent scratches made him feel he could "hours my license on the table."
Mood, most famous for the preparation of the undefeated champion black caviar, marked the rule on race day treatment for "ridiculous" after he was injected the horses up Clay compress or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
One of my team accidentally smeared mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday and it happened.
It happened in the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treatment with poultices on race day, to which the organisers have already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who create these rules, doesn't know anything about horses.
"we all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.

Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back rivals claim for wrestling
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy, surgeries, criticized his players as "agenda setting" two NRL premiership favourites.
Sydney roosters coach, Trent Robinson, said that the referee allowed players storm "wrestlovat" his controversial victory team player during the storm in the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennett, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, he made a slightly veiled comment on the Strorm after his team won the finals qualification over the North Queensland cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game a "parade" rugby league and according to him, two Queensland weren't "too big" to Wrestlemania.
Bellamy surgeries defended his players and said that the focus on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation has increased his confidence, his team has been criticised because it's two leading trainers, which may mean that they have the fear of losing team since the storm.
"it still comes - I don't remember Trent Robinson talked about wrestling, when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in the last year of our defensive system and techniques, the last weeks we only emphasized contact during crackdown, and that meant to us.
Trent's here for three years and obviously trains a great team, so it's probably not used to losing, which for him might be a bit of a shock.
It's funny how these things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy devalued Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor, bennetovův st george-illawarra dragons team that won the premiership in 2010, playing "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about the exciting football.
He was right in that it was his Saturday game similarly exciting like ours also was as exciting, "stated Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George were criticized for the fact that they were boring team and Wayne said at the time that he could care less.
But now he has a team that can play the style of play, that feels repeal, particularly his young quarterbacks with their speed.
You want to play the kind of football, if you have access to this type of players.
He said this view in 2010 and now wants everyone to teams playing his style of football - but not every team has two reservists like Anthony Milford and Ben hunt, so that's the style they play.
It makes me more confident, because they say those things, because they are worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, the US probably haven't even thought of, when getting to the big matches.
Bellamy also pointed out that in the storm and roosters game fell more wickets than in the game, the Broncos and the cowboys.
Broncos likely team game was good, I haven't checked, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game over, 20-18 in our game were two more attempts, but it's exciting football?
Or are the breaks and neskórování attempts that interesting?
To me, they're agenda.
If you refer to the US, that means that at some stage we shall meet again.
Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland or cronulla cownboys sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park, tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man won $200,000 bail on drug charges

Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of drugs from the yacht solay, who arrived from South America via Vanuatu and in August landed at Coomer.
Maksimovic was spotted together at a meeting with the accused in the port during the morning, and later met them in a cafe Coomer Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in the Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of cocaine, a commercial lawyer maksimovice quality built the case that there is no evidence that it owned the quantity and that could be entirely by accident and innocently in a cafe.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan had considered that Maksimovic escaped.
He has clear links to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he told the court on Wednesday.
When the crown case lied to police about where he lived.
Mother and stepfather maksimovice jointly offered $200,000 bail for his release.
"after reading the affidavits of persons, it is clear that both contributed USD 200 000 bail for them is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
Their effort itself was manifestly inadequate, because the defendant did not appear in court, he warned.
Maksimovicovi was granted bail on condition that he surrenders as Australian, Serbian passport, will report to the police daily and observe a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

Arsenal Captain Mikel arteta says teammates must get behind the injured Jack wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
For wilshere, Wenger also stressed that it's still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason for him to play again at Christmas.
This best scenario means that wilshere would miss at least the next four games and, from the point of view of English history, his involvement in next summer's European Championships, is obviously uncertain.
A great pity this nnejnovějšího problem is that wilshere finished strong after ankle injury last season and then again reached the former forms during předsezóny.
"this kind of injury threatens career," says Wenger.
It's a wound that needs healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't even his ankle injuries, suffered before.
That might be true from a strictly medical sense, because Wenger has admitted that there is a relative risk of other injuries, whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant formula.
Survey conducted by Premier injuries Ltd recorded 23 different injuries wilshera since six years ago had his video game Debut.
During the last five years, he played in only 65 league matches, arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a wider perspective for Arsenal, that means in six of eight seasons from 2007-08 was one of two clubs in the Premier League, who lost the most days because of the injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that improvements in recorded injuries during last season will continue.
"sometimes, when you're coming back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the competition," says Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body is stabilizing, I'm sure he does, and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal in the Champions League campaign starts on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb Saturday games with Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger prepares to rotate his team.
Héctor bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, it means that Mathieu debuchy and arteta will probably.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Nacho monreala Olivier giroudem instead of Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and let the players who need it, breathe out," says Wenger.
Even if Arsenal is clear favourite to progress from Group F maksimir, Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating Stadium in Europe.
Dinamo also haven't been defeated in a total of 41 games last season, after their campaign "invincible".
The stadium on Wednesday night, the earthquake shook the 3.2 degrees of Richter.
It was the tenth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League, when capitulated against Monaco and he remains a remote hope will lead the club to their first victory in the European Cup.
"this deployment is enormous," says Wenger.
Arsenal: it never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
Friendsfest: comedy show, which gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The lack of a similar view in different show is striking, particularly given how men need to open up to more desperate than ever, as far as suicides among young men in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the biggest single cause of death in men aged 20-45 years in Great Britain and is three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address this problem, the campaign against living miserably (calm) year 2015 as the year of a man whose aim is to challenge the culture that prevents men seek help in case of need.
At the heart of this struggle lies friendship for meeting this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students reporting symptoms of depression found that, in the event that the injured party should sufficiently high percentage of friends with "a healthy attitude," their chances of recovery has doubled.
As for those who are not depressed, constitutes the circle mentally healthy friends half a chance on the incidence of mental health problems.
But to make the friendship work, must of course be achievable as soon as possible.
In this communication via social media, with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the Communication, the immediate response is often preferable to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives has doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even if we're in reality rather isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values, our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And recently he explained how one billionaire and game designer, money really can't buy more happiness.
Beauty friends episodes for him was the source of this idea.
None of the figures was not defined your work, but their personalities shone through friendly interactions.
Joey and Chandler's humor frequent victims, watching football at the moment, comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that, yes, men can also identify with it, although usually they keep your feelings to yourself.
Kindly explain to me how one worker:... "my role as an audience of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed that even the tiniest friendly interactions may make a difference."
The men who contact us, often feels the inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends are one of the shows, which arise in my memory when I'm trying to offer longer-term compensation mechanism.
Highlights the small moments in a man's friendship.
As for my task, outsider status on the telephone, to help people in moments of despair, but long-term aid must come from a bigger network of close friends and family.
Therefore, if you're going on this weekend frendsfest hosted by comedy central station, why not take your friends for a drink at a central Perk, where it will be to celebrate the interior completely rewritten.
Or when you see someone alone in a Starbucks, just smile and say hello to him.
You never know what difference it can make your friendship.
"friends" will be broadcast on comedy central station from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for # friendsfest
Di Maria scored and helped sweep aside PSG Malmo
Angel di Maria celebrates with Charlotte and matuidim edinsonem cavanim malmu wickets against the run.
Angel di Maria scored in his debut in the Champions League and so helped PSG on Tuesday beat Swedish team Malmo.
Here's the report on the game, and the response to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in the Champions League final victory against malmu comfortable 2-0 at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after their debut in the Champions League and this player sent the French Champions PSG to victory, but then threw away several chances, until finally upped their advantage when Cavani often head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in the group and the team, and that's why Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, are not just focusing on the skills to the elimination rounds, but to improve their road to the quarter-finals, which recorded in each of the previous three years.
But even if you get three points, it wasn't a classic performance team of Laurent Blanc and ibrahimovic was lavish Gilden tree in front of the net and was later replaced by against his home team and club in which he began his illustrious career in 1999.
"it's not easy to win the league championship outside or at home, so does our opponents problems winning 2-0 and look comfortable in defence is a good start, even if there are things that we need to improve with the procedure of the season," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we nevstřelili about one or two more wickets.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of three changes to the team, PSG, who took home this weekend draw 2-2 with Bordeaux in League 1, but he was upstaged by di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing has been identified as a man who moves to a new level of PSG in Europe after transferring from Manchester United, which took place last month, and he showed why, when he ran on the pass for defense Marc verrattiho Malm and beautiful finish behind Johan wilanda sent the ball into the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone starts it, expecting a big victory, PSG had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in the playoffs and got to this stage, with 9 of the Internationale came into the starting lineup and five defenders and two reservists were retracted a formidable opponent.
But in addition to missile Nikola djurdjice narrowly missed the far corner of the goal in the 34th minute Kevin Trapp, it didn't offer much in attack.
Instead, the PSG alone were ripping off an attack on the poor and miserable přihrávkami endings, which wasn't good even from ibrahimovice who couldn't even shot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed, because his missile arrived at the network shortly after the start of the second half Cavani.
However, pointed much more appropriate, when it came to the preparation of chances for his teammates and it was from his pass, when di Maria sent missile drill, which ended in wilandově goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of games thanks cavanimu, this line has already sent the Uruguayan heading for a Sixth goal this season after his pass after pass from ibrahimovic left wing from Maxwell.
That Malm ceases all thoughts regarding the possibility that they could extract something from the game, and only a superb save from a great proximity wilanda dashed the hopes of David Luiz and the score remained unchanged even when the goal was střídajícího Ezequiel lavezziho unrecognized at the end of the game.
Malmö coach Åge hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, nor stated: "our last game in the Champions League took place in December of last year."
Since then, we just played Swedish League, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches is not enough.
Hats off for Paris.
For them it was a fascinating game.

As the refugee crisis ripped through the Schengen area.
An emergency beacon was launched by Germany by far nestmelila European crew, but he forced the ship to change course, he wrote the French newspaper Le Figaro.
The European Union decided Monday to deal first with the issue of refugees: will rather be systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they step on the old continent - especially in Greece, than to argue for the sake of future distribution of refugees According to quotas on the basis of quantity, which increasingly moving away from reality.
Six days after the European Commission President Jean-Claude JUNCKER asked 25 of the 28 EU countries, to be reallocated 160 thousand refugees, they changed the interior ministers of the Member States ’ priority.
Than worry about the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who arrive already today and to resolve the fate of those who are already inside the Schengen area.
"the effective management of the external borders of the EU is necessary for managing migration," stressed in text Ministers discussed Monday in Brussels.
After the crisis, the EU finds common currency that is at risk in his next big integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but not losing their decisiveness and increases the pressure.
Restoring border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those who seek asylum in this country.
Central power that makes it clear that, without it, there is no free movement in Europe possible.
It would serve as proof that Austria and Slovakia on Monday joined to this measure.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and even France are thinking about it, too, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary to that was a long time ago.
This exceptional and temporary measures are allowed under Schengen rules.
That's a domino effect, but even a blind man can see.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, in the south of Italy and also in Hungary, for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague, Thomas de Maizière intensively discussed about it during a private conversation with three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is tough.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics were already recorded and identified with taking fingerprints two-thirds of newly arrived refugees.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory, because they fear more than the others, so on her shoulders, left the camps in which the refugees massed on its account.
Greece remains a real black hole.
On its islands near the Turkish coast landed this year, more than 200,000 people, which is more than twice recently arrived to Italy.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through the crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge, gaping hole.
Athens, which are still in financial turmoil and they are waiting for a new government, his hands folded in his lap.
That's the starting point for the Balkan route and now common source of worry for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
JUNCKER the Commission promises to introduce control points occurs as soon as possible, but did not provide any number or a date.
"the challenges facing Greece, relate to the whole of Europe," agreed on Monday, European Union Interior Ministers on the mobilization on this front.
It is therefore in this country to deploy teams of the European border control agency, Frontex.
The EU wants to help Greece to extend its capacity for receiving refugees and strengthen supervision of the islands.
"it will require adequate financial resources," warns the text submitted to Ministers for approval.
In terms of rights will continue to have the last word in Athens.
The real question of the creation of European border guards were not officially raised, but Europe a close second.
The new emergency situation 'as she pushed on the back burner so the question of mandatory quotas and 160 thousand refugees already at the beginning of the year, which raised the Juncker Commission and European Parliament and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They regard it as an attack on its sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, Monday was maintained in the text approved mostly '.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only strong promise includes the redistribution of 40 thousand refugees in the next two years, of which agreement has been reached in June during the hectic EU summit concludes, Le Figaro.
