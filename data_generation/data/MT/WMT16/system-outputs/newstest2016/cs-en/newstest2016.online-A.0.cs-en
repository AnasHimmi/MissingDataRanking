When the safe call the Professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend
During a call on the emergency line with a shaking voice Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to police that he shot his girlfriend and need to come home to them.
Lamb resolved that his "sweet dog" was the House alive and probably upset, and that contacts on the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and hand written message on a white Office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could go back, I loved Amy and she is the only one who ever loved me," it said in the letter, which according to authorities signed the Lamb.
There was no suspicion that the Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles on a school campus, where the police believes that he shot the popular Professor Ethan Schmidt in the doorway of his Office.
The Chief of police in Delta State University Lynn Buford said that employees of the University heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb said he made the fateful phone call to an emergency line shortly after.
Finally, came yet another death; Lamb took his own life when police came for him.
The day after the shooting in the school forced the students and faculty, to hid behind locked doors, is entrusted with the Authority still trying to fathom what was Lambova motivation.
The details published on the State investigators, and students and staff, who knew him, and together they created the image of a talented, but probably the problem teachers.
Students confirmed that its lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or record of a violent past.
Schmidt himself included in the book that the Lamba wrote in a thank you "great people", with whom he shared the academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of social sciences and history along with the other 17 members of the Faculty and many students went to classes with both at once.
At the same time there are inclination when it comes to problems.
A student who praised the Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also had agitovaný and trembling, "as if it wasn't right."
Another student, Melissa Sykes, said that his Lamb said he is struggling with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for time off for health reasons when he stated that he has a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes regarding the recruitment of the staff of the University meant that the doctorate, on which a Lamb worked hard, didn't guarantee him automatic term, to become an Assistant Professor.
University President William LaForge said that he did not know of any conflict between the Café and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamba seemed worried about something."
To these questions we have Lamb does not respond.
After he left the campus, the police caught his foot when stepping over the border of the State of Arkansas back into the Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, the Lamb is killed jedinýmvýstřelem of the gun in the yard of a House about a mile from their parents on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, coroner confirmed the State of Washington, Methel Johnson.
The car let up on the street.
It was not immediately clear why the Lamb went into this House, although Johnson said she probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb started working at the University, which has 3500 students in the town, which has about 12000 inhabitants in 2009 and taught geography and hours of training.
In the spring, he received a doctorate in education.
One of the longtime friends Lamba described him as smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carl Hairston said that she was 15 and Lambovi 20, when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was a great older boy, who taught several years playing on the guitar.
It was at that time quite a heartbreaker.
The heart of all the wretched girls, once discovered, "said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in a suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss allegedly went along for some time.
During the emergency call Lamb said: "I've killed my wife," but the record of marriage never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which adjoins the river arm Gautier.
Police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn about ´ Steen, said that split up 15 years ago, but they remained friends and they had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was totally collapsed," he said about his daughter ´ Steen.
She was with the mother of best friend.
About ´ Steen said he met with Café, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss, when along with Abigail vystuopovali at the summer festival three years ago.
Later played together random gigy.
About ´ Steen said that his daughter, writes and sings his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment Coordinator in The Julep Room, dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamba and Prentiss at night 5. September, pot what Lamb had finished on the guitar and the harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We fooled around and recorded each joke.
I mean, that both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the slain Professor, led a workshop in the first year and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a Professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of the boys ' Club and the Student Government students.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, staff, students and community members attended the consultation events with candles.
Wife Liz and Schmidtova, brother Jeff Schnidt also attended vigílie, during which the University Choir, a chorus sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
In the middle school started again.
"We try to make our students came back, '' says LaForge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Pisatelky for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story has been modified to reflect the fact that the police now say that the Lamb did call on the emergency line after killing Schmidt, and that although the Lamb called Prentiss and his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually're married.

8 polling numbers, which show that Donald Trump in real light
Some tried to mark him as a man who often changes opinions.
The other hand over where as over inadequate wit.
And some are preparing for the implosion.
But some Republicans trying to download Donald Trump down from the top of the elections, they cannot (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead of a two-digit number, and some people are starting to really wonder what this means for nominating a chance this mogul of real estate.
Of course, it is still only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of the year 2011 the leadership of Rick Perry made a path to the rise of Herman or Caine, one of them did not win a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why you might encounter in the general election.
But outside groups such as the Super PAC Jeba Bush and economic conservative group Club for Growth, are aware of the Trumpovu will stand and begin to interpret their dollars on stop in order to overthrow him.
Here are some of the recent voting numbers, which suggest that real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
Trumpovo evaluation of the auspiciousness of 180 degrees turned on.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, turned out to vote, that the University, Monmouth, only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view on the real estate magnate.
In mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
It now has six of the 10 Republicans favorable view on Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are in the early stages.
After the vote, the University of Quinnipiac, conducted last week, found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of voters, the GOP would have been satisfied with Donald Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll, which took place last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they were either "enthusiasm" or "satisfied" with Donald Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they were "indignant" of his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent of people said that they were "thrilled" against 40 percent who say the same thing about Mr. Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters claim that they were "dissatisfied" or "upset" If the undertaking favorite Jeb Bush became the candidate.
Most Republicans do not see as a problem Backing temperament.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide, is inclined to the idea that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for the post of President, according to Monday's vote, ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is holding in the caucus State of Iowa, which is the first in the whole country, where 52 percent of Republicans think's that has the personality of the Commander, according to the Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he has the personality to serve effectively, nearly 6 out of 10 independent says that his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to the ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When you deploy your scholarly hats, Republican voters think that Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said they would Trump was the best option, according to the CNN/ORC poll from last week.
This is a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeba Bush.
Full disclosure: the voters the GOP had in the past, the clearest crystal ball.
By this time last cycle's 4 out of 10 Republicans Rick Perry has selected as the winner of the candidates against the 28 percent for Mitt Romney's nomination.
However, indicates that a certain number of voters the GOP sees as credible, the campaign Reported.
Even when Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump just beats almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that fragmented the field likely to contribute to the Trump is lead, while anti-Trumpovská support is distributed between the diffusion-more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey of Monmouth University from the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical direct duel between Trump and most other Republican candidates almost always Trump gets majority support.
Leads over Carly Fiorinou about 13 points, Marc Rubiem about 14 points, Walker about 15 points, 19 points Jebem Bush and finally, Rand Paul, John Kasichem, Chris Christiem about 33 points each.
It is in a race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson led above the trader about the broad 19 points in a hypothetical match one against one.
A bare majority of the followers of Donald Trump says he's already made his point of view.
The new CBS/NYT survey Tuesday showing that just more than half of the voters supporting the Trump contends that his opinion had not changed.
It is obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that they never changed his opinion.
46 percent stated that they leave the back door for a change among the candidates.
Yet it is Backing the current strongest adversary of his colleague Oskar, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their views in the final, would be more likely to vote twice went for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agrees with Donald Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even from the time when Donald Trump called the immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in the notification the speech his campaign, immigration remains as the main and central topic of conversation for the year 2016.
Some fear that the trumps ' bombast draw 'em away key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and the damage to the application about the rebranding.
But according to a new poll Monday ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Donald Trump in matters of immigration.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration will remain in the spotlight, Donald Trump also remains.
The frustration of the Government reaches new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now receive about half the support from Republican voters, mainly due to their State of outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post poll Monday claims that they want to prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry at Washington.
Vote Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated Republicans in Congress, 54 percent is "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "angry as hell."
The Chamber of Deputies endorsed a larger share of the State charges for coal.
The Czech Republic gets more than 400 million.
The Chamber of Deputies supported the Government in first reading amendments to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of income taxes from surface mining of brown coal from the mining company.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) members promised that thanks to gain extra money as the State Treasury, the budgets of the municipalities.
The draft criticized members of the opposition who fear that mining companies will not want to patronize the municipality so as yet, because they will pay higher fees directly to the State budget. The Chamber of Deputies supported the Government in first reading amendments to the Mining Act, which among other things means that the State should receive the greater part of the yield of the fees of the surface mining of brown coal from the mining company.
The State's share will rise to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will be reduced from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also change the method of calculating remuneration for the minerals that the company yields.
Change in fees for the extraction of minerals is to bring to the Treasury about 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
On revenue budgets of municipalities is to have a neutral impact, according to the Government, because the fee to be higher.
In předloňském year have completed the village of roughly 450 million crowns and the State budget of 150 million dollars.
From the mining of brown coal was about 200 million crowns to the municipalities and the State of 66 million kroner.
The amendment also with an increase in the remuneration of the mining area of the mining-1000 kroons per one hectare per year.
Income from these payments is still in full scale belong to municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) members said that municipalities receive annually because of this, instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining taxes will no longer determine the law, but it provides for government regulation.
Reimbursement is calculated as the product of the quantity of newly mined mineral and rates for individual types of minerals.
According to the Government, is the reason for the changes, inter alia, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
Member of the ODS Marek Benda but warned that setting a fee by regulation of the Government may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to the Minister of Mládka, in this case about the tax, because the State will charge for the mineral, which is State property.
The fees they receive only the municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of underground coal mining will get three-fourths of the money the village and a quarter of the State.
The same ratio will be even in the case of the mining of radioactive minerals.
Part of the money, which the State on charges of exploitation, will be assigned the bound.
For example, 28 percent of it will have to go on repairing the damage after extraction or to ensure the mine rescue service.
The draft criticized opposition members who argued in particular that damaged the village affected by mining and the region.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and mayors) warned that the mining company will not want to patronize the municipality so as yet, because they will pay higher fees directly to the State budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions only to the Minister of Finance's budget, making things better," said David Kádner (Dawn) selected in the Ústí nad Labem region.
Before the rise in unemployment in the most Member of KSČM warned Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to reject the law wanted to return Government Kučera for completion.
In the explanatory memorandum, in accordance with the mining companies, the increase in charges will in the prices of coal, because the prices are more than 90 percent of the contracted on a long-term basis.
The main consumers as power plants or heating plants would therefore not increase in prices.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that remittances will increase mining organizations to compensate for the effort to reduce its operating expenses, which would primarily meant the reduction of number of employees," admits the Government.
It is, however, the increase in charges in terms of employment of the subcontinent.
According to the rapporteur to amendment by Milan Urban (ČSSD) is the key to MEPs before the approval of the law knew the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and mainly the decision of the Government on the limits for coal mining.
If coal will benefit as well as the limits, then this will have an impact on revenue for the State and the community, he stressed.
Urban disagree with Mládkem in that the decision on breaking the limit on the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should be made up to the year 2020.
Limits on the bottom of the CSA would, according to him, should break down have for reasons of social, national and because of the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.

Since his election Mr Corbyna is the debut in PMQ very enthusiastically expected
Jeremy Corbyn, the new head of the work will have its debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time will have to work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will lay the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance probably will be carefully examined the media and parliamentarians.

The decision of Mr. Corbyna nezpívat national anthem to himself drew attention to the
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyna said he will be "standing in respectful silence" and acknowledging "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the battle of Britain."
However, a member of the shadow cabinet, Mr Corbyna, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that the labouristickému leaders recommended the national anthem to sing "whatever" on his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow Ministers refused to serve in the top team of Mr. Corbyna, cited differences in the economy, defence and Foreign Affairs, and only less than one-sixth of the parliamentary parties supported him initially as the leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work also "Bank" after the appointment of Mr Corbyna over its position in the European Union and the Government limit the benefits.

Metcash is launching a campaign in rural areas, to fight with the invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its stores IGA from the onslaught of Aldi in the South and Western Australia.
Metcash is launching a campaign in rural areas, to fight with the invasion of Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers, and the first of more than 120 shops in the South and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash IGA supermarkets and strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and build brand by marketing in the mainstream of IGA and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are added with markers such as zmrzlinovač based on the Dunsborough Simmo's offering tastings in stores IGA, and the owners of shops selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League of local customers.
It is expected to publish further details of its Metcash defense strategy 29. September, when the seller of food, alcohol and the hardware will celebrate the day of your annual strategic investor.
A lot is at stake, because the South and Western Australia represent nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA business steps and generate higher turnover than Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Customers in the South and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and the shops of the IGA are enjoying much stronger share of the market than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland-more than 30 percent in SA and WA 24 percent, compared with about 14 percent in the Eastern States.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believes that Aldi's políčí on 5 percent of the food market in these two States during the 12 months since the opening of the first trades that took sales from all the existing players, but mainly to independent retailers.
In its report this week, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that retail IGA could lose $ 360 million on annual sales of $ 250 million and Metcash at the end of the year 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West during the next year, and will generate sales of 500 and 600 million USD on the individual markets.
The loss of sales volumes in the food and the price base of Metcash could cost around $ 13 million before taxes on revenue, confirmed Mr Kierath.
At the same time Metcash is losing market share in the markets in the Eastern States, mainly against Aldi and Coles, as the latest survey by Roy Morgan found that shoppers in the IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that food sales will fall about 3.8 percent of Metcash in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and the 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will be reduced from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week a leading Fund Manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan financial group, said the business lunch in Melbourne could be "highly likely to disappear during the Decade.
Metcash has refused to publicly respond to Douglassův comment.
But it is known that the Board of Directors of Metcash contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent by the year 2010 and earnings from trade in food, which adds about Metcash 1200 IGA retailers, fell 43 percent from the year 2012, reflecting the changes to the operational development of the speculation, because sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesale trade, he moved to counterattack, and invest more than $ 150 million a year to call the hotel prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week to help equip stores IGA enables retailers again by adding a fast growing food and news from freeholders.
Metcash Chief Executive, Ian Morrice, argue that the programs calling prices and retrofit the stores to catch momentum and hopes that wholesale reverts back to the basic profitable growth of profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his fame rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became a minor loss in the recent fuss about his friend Nick Kyrgiose and deserve praise for their behavior rather than criticism, says the President of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo is often called the "Special," drew some unwelcome attention because of an affair with the notorious Kyrgiosem and Stan Wawrinkou at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, had to be the Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison twice separated by the referee, Harrison once said: "Wawrinka had one stretch Kyrgiosovi and I had a stretch."
While he was seen as the last breaking down the rocket after the spasm can extinguish fighting Richard Gasqueta on the US Open, staunchly defended the Kokkinakise Healy.
The young man is currently located in Glasgow, where it competes with Sam Groth in the second singles on the location for Bernard Romicem in the semifinals of the Davis Cup against Britain.
"I thought about that in my opinion was a bit into the whole dispute Thanasi retracted," says Healy.
Destroyed the rocket's when lost due to spasm in the US, but it is not the first player that due to frustration of itself up in anger at its rocket. I know Thanasiho well enough and I can say that this event will not be proud of.
But seriously, handled very well, because he was in the U.S. issued a very provocative circumstances due to Harrison and so on, so in my opinion deserves great appreciation.
It has a fantastic team around him, also has a great family around him, and I think that with him was treated somewhat harshly.
It's a very adult 19letý man, is working very hard and the team fits great and so on, never had a problem with the other players in the dressing room is very respected, he trains hard, he is in amazing shape, it is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged by its own merits.
Healy also backed the decision to miss the match because of the important Kyrgiose, which starts on Friday, and States that "mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports a native from Canberra to return to the team as a star on the long term.
"First of all, we want to make our team was completely focused on the game and not on all the controversy around him, [Kyrgios] was founded," says Healy.
And I think that Nick was rising very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people have pointed out, in the eyes of the public is growing rapidly, also made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism you receive, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his acts and some time out of the limelight, when will be able to think about it, it is in my opinion the best solution for the team and for him alone.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares a State of emergency, closing borders and restrains the migrants
After the announcement of a State of emergency in Hungary Tuesday concluded their southern border with Serbia and restrained those who attempted the illegal crossing so as to stop the influx of migrants.
On the border of chaos, while hundreds of migrants are accumulated in the land and the Serb authorities have responded indignantly.
Those who were stranded on an unknown period on the belts of the country between the two States is those who are fleeing from violence in native countries, build tents and zabydlují.
But here comes the feelings of frustration.
When the helicopter passes over them, migrants together are calling "open the borders!" and the riot police unit of the Hungarian lament.
Some at the protest, refusing food and water.
Serbian Foreign Minister declares that it was "unacceptable" that refugees have been sent back from Hungary, while there are still more coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, and not just the indirect injury.
During the next days you will need to discuss with Brussels and other countries, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Unrest in Hungary-Serb border came a day after the block of 28 States did not come with a uniform immigration policy at the ongoing meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in the surprised Italy and Greece and talked with the hope of achieving the eventual agreement next month or at the end of the year, which the peoples of the EU adopted more than 120 000 other refugees, including Hungary.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary however their hopes on neupínala Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday the State of emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities more power to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up court cases discussing asylum.
Meanwhile, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that his country also plans to build a fence of barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania, to stop the refugees, who are trying to go through their country, when the fence is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News korepondent Charlie D ´ Agata reported that even prisoners have been on the list of those who helped stretch out barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary became the main weakness and the entry point to the European Union for the refugees, many of whom fled from Syria and other countries in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted, however, that most of them are economic migrants, who go for a better life and not war refugees, who are looking for protection, which is a look that is clearly different from the other EU States, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary now kriminalizují violation of the 4 metre fence that the Government built on the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for a longer period in jail for those refugees illegally transferred.
"Thanks to the situation caused by the mass migration of the Hungarian Government announces a State of emergency," he said to reporters, Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we have a completely clear: illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Parliament must still approve, technically the deployment of the army, which is expected in the next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border, watching heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Ray Bakondi, Advisor to Orban for home defense, he said, that the authorities caught the 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 on the territory of the State have already caught.
Penetrated by the damage to the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing offences under the new laws.
Authorities quickly left the fence mended.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday, the morning after the used tractor truck covered with barbed wire.
At the main border crossing at Roszke was chaos, because the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container for processing and the crush of people.
About 20 of them could fit inside, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, while refusing food and water, they will not be allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election of 2016: ahead of Hillary Clinton before Bernie Sanders declined by half in the national vote
Former us Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (a drop from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27% (an increase of 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will want to be President, gets support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters saying it is too early to say that they are clearly the decision of which candidate they will support.
But sponsors of the Clinton's are more sure of their choice, than those who support other candidates.
From a CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost ground for several demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few.
Clinton maintains big lead among women and moderates, but its lead is narrowing.
Her support among men has decreased significantly and Sanders on her losing only 5 points.
The advantage of Clinton with democratic voters under 50 years, and now they are evaporated with Sanders's equal.
Clinton has a big lead but still thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-digit lead over Sanders between the Liberals, but now her Sanders loses in this group only 5 points.
About half of Democratic primary voters in the State say they would happily support Clinton, if he became a candidate of the party.
A quarter of it support with some reservations and the other 15 percent would support it only for this, that is a contender.
Six percent would support it.
Probably not a surprise that are current supporters of Clinton because of her particular zeal.
Views are mixed among those that currently do not support Clinton--only about a quarter would enthusiastically support.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common response is that he has the right experience (16 percent), followed by that time is that the President's wife (13 percent), and that is the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Supporters of Clinton also mentioned her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, it is cited and that the chosen United on the issues.
While the Vice President is considering a potential candidacy for President, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to do it again-one-third think that the candidate did not.
When were the primary democratic voters are asked who would be selected as the second choice for the party nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half said Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden chooses nekandidovat on the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead is expanded from 20 points when Biden will run, on 30 points, without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning in the general election; However, this number dropped from 78 percent from the previous month.
Biden is a far second in this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely zvolitelného, is increasing.
However, when it came to the question of the greater importance of the candidate, the Democratic voters prefer solving problems before more chances at the election.
Like last month, not one Democratic candidate or potential candidate to act as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, have good results in some of the key characteristics of the primary voters of his party.
The majority sees Clinton, Sanders and Biden as sincere and trustworthy, and they think that they have a strong leadership quality.
Biden from all three leads in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, i.e. twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent of him has this opinion.
Democratic primary voters also generally sees Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in accordance with their ideological view.
As regards all these standards, about a quarter of democratic voters has no opinion on Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server capacity as State Secretary, most of the Democratic primary electorate is satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view did not affect at all on her.
But among the American public, it is overall a different story.
Half of Americans is now with her explanation of the dissatisfied, while only about a third of it is satisfied.
The views of the public on this subject were distributed in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans say that the e-mail controversy has no impact on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent of their opinion on Clinton.
It is mainly about Republicans, where there are more than 6 out of 10 claiming that their opinion of Clinton.
Even though Clinton is perceived as honest and trust between voters of her party, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: 32 percent of it only sees it as honest and trustworthy, which is a drop of eight points from last month, and about 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think that is honest and trustworthy.
And while 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see also Trump as an honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested in the honesty's the best led Biden, Carson and Bush.
Sanders sees more people as an honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters did on it's opinion.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished behind Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest survey, CBS News/New York Times
The two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest survey and other leave asking for support.
Voters from among Republicans across the country continue to overwhelmingly support the Trump, and climbed from 23% in the last survey carried out before the CBS debate Fox News last month, 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired in the same period from 6 to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson's good leads across the demographic groups, and excludes a Trump of the studied Republican voters among the educated.
The rest of the field with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the Governor of the State of Ohio, John Kasiche, is left behind together wisconsinským Governor Scott Walker on the observation deck of the 10% support fell to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are all together on the third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus or minus 6% and it was held in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week, showed that Carson's reformed and reached 19% support among Republicans for Trumpovou 32% support.
The latest survey from the ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
When the rising trend, Carson decided to Trump to fire blindly on the retired neurosurgeon, and even Carson apologized for questioning about the Trump faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity were charged with the death of a student's first year of Baruch College
Nearly two years after a student died during fraternal přetěžovacího ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, has filed murder charges against five people.
Members of the brotherhood New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" during the opening ceremony in Deng for September 2013 and delayed took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
The police stated that he had blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand, of a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly molested, when he tried to be objective through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell into a coma.
The members of Pi Delta Psi Fraternity called 911 immediately after Deng passed out, and reportedly waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, police say.
However, they found the time change Dengovy clothes, vygooglovat his symptoms and contact Andy Menga, National President of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, said Police Chief Chris Vagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members started to hide equipment and basically gave priority to the welfare of the fraternity before the life Deng for Michael," said the Chief of the Wagner.
Failed to revive him, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, he was struck by a blunt object to Deng the capability to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of hazing in the bratrstvích and at least one student die each year due to overloading from the year 1970.0," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Dengovu family, in a statement.
The fraternity and its members have the responsibility and this is a step on the part of the authorities.
A grand jury recommended that the Monroe County charges of murder in the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Menga, will also be accused of the assault and the overloading of a criminal organisation.
"We want to hold back not only to the person concerned, but in the event that there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, the stand is the responsibility also," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College prohibited fraternities and the national fraternity canceled its relationship with local branches.
This tent, when the Fed raises interest rates
Growth rates and a bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy slides into a recession.
All this we know.
What we don't know is how much time it takes and how long it will take.
For the economy specifically offers the history of the small about the timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the u.s. Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, though not always, indicating how the economy and financial assets.
This is the reason why the u.s. Central Bank officials have stressed so heavily that the investors should not be focused on it, when to start raising rates, but rather the trajectory, how long will it take for normalization.
In the game is actually more variables.
However, members can market to make sure that all the fuss due to increase in speed may be exaggerated.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of an era ' of cheap money, '" said in a note to clients, Julian Jessop, an economist at Capital Economics, global leaders.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of American interest rates to more common, but still low, creates a seizmický shock, which many fear could.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy to respond, based on historical trends:
Whereas, what the market has seen in the last about a month, can expect rate hikes to make the air a bit unstable.
But as soon as the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a trend to stop shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which once again reflected the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study about what happens after the Fed increase.
More specifically, the market for the past 35 years, often the most--about 14 percent--heading to a rate increase in the relatively flat in 250 days (the average increment of 2.6 percent), and then again returns to a normal state after a period of 500 days, with the average yield from the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis of the Bob, the main 17th Dolla stock strategist company Nuveen Asset Management, published by Barron's.
Deutsche said that the impact on stocks tends to become stronger later in the cycle of raising rates and the return is beginning to decrease.
The recession is a fact of economic life, but the rate increases often help her.
Currently facing the Fed some of the conditions that have existed and that could precipitate a recession.
The most remarkable is that the gross domestic product, close to its lowest point in history when the Fed's rate increase.
According to the Deutsche Bank has been raising rates during the 118 since 1950 only twice the nominal annual growth in GDP below 4.5 percent.
Despite the fact that in the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect his keeping, when it was in the third quarter at only 1.5 percent, shows the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky and could discover the question "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready on the Fed's growth all year, and all eyes turned to a meeting of the Federal open market Committee, which was held this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could at this meeting to approve the increase, future trading indicates only 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950 have all been zvyšovací cycles so far in the super cycle, increasing leverage with a GDP zakrývajícím peaks early recession very quickly after the onset of a recovery," it said in the report.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sample period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of those, when the Fed had waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and still continue.
Fixed income was also volatile, because the market expects a rate increase and the pattern is somewhat similar to what you are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is noticeable faster than on bonds, shares, when the Fed changes the direction of policy.
For bonds, it seems that changes direction immediately after the first arrival of a cycle of increase/decrease.
At the end of a cycle of increasing bond yields fall immediately, "Deutsche said.
Charles Schwaba strategists believe that the increase in rates will cause the approach yields between long-and short-sent on bonds, which balances the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, even though "we are still cautious about the yield tension," it said in its analysis, Kathy Jones, firmly fixed income analyst in the company of Schwab.
Interestingly, that Jones thinks markets are no longer adapted to the expectations of the Fed's policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and a decline in inflation expectations, there are few signs that the market fit tighter monetary policy prospects," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are at the top, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads widened and volatility has increased-all the characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that conduct most of their business in the u.s., the win after the increase in interest rates and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with lots of debt will grow worse because a rising dollar will make their products more expensive on the world market in the area and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that" quality "stocks tend to outperform during the three months after the initial increase in rates," the Goldman analysts said in a report to clients, Sachsve.
Companies with strong balance sheets were weak to overtake the balance sheet of the company in any increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also surpassed its counterparts of lower quality in the average of 4 (percentage points), or 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a major problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside of pure stock games benefit consumers also thanks to the rising dollar.
Spořitelé may see their profits also through higher yields, but experts have different opinions on it, how long it will take.

"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and the placing into service of the new works is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year argued the BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey, that you must now work harder to engage audiences than before, because the British are less educated as far as classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC, which has come under fire for treading on the heels of the commercial competitors during the broadcast of the culture, Media and sport and the got to the hearing of the Commission.

However, he refused to rule out ordering more for future series of program The Voice or spending money taxpayers royalties on other entertainment formats.

As regards the energy value of the food, it is important to realize that a much better natural foods with nutritious substances than the so-called empty calories.

The majority then and barbecues are held several times a year.
To be successful, we must not underestimate the barbecuing preparing-ideal is the meat marinováním few hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is the best and at the same time when grilling leaving the health of beneficial substances?
Generally, when the process of grilling should conserve fat.
Experts agree that a large part of oils at high temperatures starts to lose its flavor.

When preparing Marinades must be present three ingredients: oil, acidity and spice.
For example, the acidity of the cider vinegar and will deliver the bar so the softening meat.
Spice turn adds meat flavor and oil and supplies the right psychopath zest, advises Daniel Vlcek.
At the same time, he adds, that grape seed oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils can penetrate through the dark meat.
Marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra Virgin oil is characterized by the fact that the preparation of the dishes were just a few drops.
The same is true also for grilling.
Some oils are for this way of preparing a complete taboo.
This concerns, in particular, flax, hemp and rapeseed oils that should not at all hot.
Before grilling, brush the grill with oil to prevent overcooking the food.
An essential part of the barbecue is also a preparation of the annexes.

Multiple sclerosis: it doesn't matter just on drugs, but also on the patient's willingness to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complex disease and the person with this diagnosis needs care series experts: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergoterapeuta, Urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist and many other specialists.
It's not only about the medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultation, if they decide to have a child, to care for these patients include operating an advice, recommendations for treatment of housing, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect patient yourself.
The more actively fight with the disease, the longer it can work and may not fundamentally change the style of your life.
As the attention of the doctors, the passivity of sick releases space to the activity of the disease.
For example, it is demonstrated that regular exercise considerably postpones the time when sick needs some compensatory aid, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings not subject to various myths, such as that the disease is automatically leads to the fact, that ends up in a wheelchair.
Why was the page get a chance (URwww.bezmytu.cz), which is backed by ongoing media campaigns, Give yourself a chance.
The most important person in the care of the patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis paid twice saying that the disease starts to heal sooner, the doctor can affect something.
It is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis the inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegenerace is not yet so strong.
The sooner you know, the greater is the chance that we can stop the disease and out invalidizaci, he explains. Eva Honey from the Neurological clinic of the General faculty hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often addresses the weakness of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
The sick works according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improved walking, strengthening the pelvic floor disorders, swallowing or to improve coordination.
"It really depends on the individual, specific problems of the patient," he says. Martina Kövári, head physician of the Clinic, rehabilitation and sports medicine teaching hospital in motol.
People with multiple sclerosis may suffer from the same disease had, but for each a little different way. manifests
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but always can relieve its symptoms.
Physical activity also enhances the immune status of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another advantage of regular exercise is the fact that ill verify what they can handle, and it reinforces their confidence.
"The exercise also wash up the endorphins and man it feels good," says PhDr. Kamila Monitoring from the clinic of rehabilitation medicine faculty hospital Královské Vinohrady.
The fact that we influence the physical page, we operate to the limbic system responsible for emotions.
Direct interference into the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"Previously, these patients said to conserve, we now know that they need a proper burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolar, head of the Clinic, rehabilitation and sports medicine teaching hospital in motol.
The aim of physiotherapy is, that a man could stay as long as possible a self-sufficient, including employment classification.
Physiotherapists therefore cooperate with ergoterapeuty, so that each person got a compensatory aid enjoyment to him.
Many of the patients needs and the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When you come into the life of serious illness, the majority of people that shake.
Experience shock, panic, fear.
Must respond to a big load-loss of health.
With this rozbolavělou the soul we have someone go make all carried away on their own shoulders.
"I'm working with them so that in the end they concluded that even with a handicap can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Raspberry-C S of the Neurological clinic of the General faculty hospital in Prague.
Without manufacturer Latecoere would Prague Airbus dimples off.
Air production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
The new airplanes are full of titanium or light and hard composite materials so that someone can't make and handle.
Yet it can be next to superpřesných, computer-controlled machine tools, in addition to the autoclaves for forming composites come across something so ordinary, such as apricot pits.
In the drum, which resembles a pot on the cotton candy, is in a heap of stones omílají edges of sheet metal parts, which had just pulled out of the milling machine.
"So far, no one has anything better," says Ivan Dubský, Director General of air door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the complex in Prague's Letňany produces complete door for earlier Letov Airbus A320.
As the only company in the world to supply doors for Brazilian Embraer 170.
The door, part of which is drawn up in Prague, also a passenger in the first and upper class on the upper decks of the world's largest airliner Airbus A380.
Mounted and door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
Need torque wrenches leaves the company adjusted twice a year.
If, on the yellow sticker was missing the record of inspection, in the Prague race should explain what the auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who travel regularly to detect if the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
The human senses, but advanced technology has completely did it.
On one door to the A320 is 1500 rivets.
You must manually nýtaři shiver.
It takes them two days ago.
I know the sound of a hammer hitting, if he is to sing properly rivet.
Tolerance, in which they move, is minimal.
Rivet can above the surface of the aircraft stand out from scratch to 0.13 millimeter.
This is roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
When it comes to checking a number of trained touch.
When the controller moves the finger after the number of rivets, if one is out of tolerance.
Then he takes in hand the exact dial indicator holder.
Letov living before 1989 program of military training aircraft L-39.
But in 1991, he produced neither.
The company had to quickly find a new contract.
When put together with European manufacturer Airbus.
Has won the tender on emergency door supplier for the A321 model.
The courtship with Boeing were not so fortunate.
"We were for them when the small company, which did not have enough money to invest and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable supply," recalls the outcome.
The door to the American manufacturers would remain closed if the Letov in 1999 did not deliver on the Prague Conference of the International Association of French Aerospace Group Latecoere.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The second day of the negotiations with the French, says the outcome.
A year later the Czech company Latecoere and bought companies with strong new orders came in.
In 2000, the Assembly of parts of the doors for the A320.
Three years later, the doors of the upper deck were added for the A380.
In 2006 the company built a new hall for the processing of composites because of deliveries for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without the Latecoere, we ourselves to these large orders.
Maybe we were doing small parts or components.
The partners want to guarantee supply for twenty or thirty years, explains the outcome.
Last year, the turnover reached over Czech Latecoere 2.9 billion and profit after taxation of 147 million dollars.
Exclusive position among the suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague since 2000 has invested $ 1.5 billion.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of the 170 special production processes and passes on the qualifications for key staff.
Without them, the enterprise no door to the aircraft went into full-scale production.
Obtain certificates that meet the requirements of customers ' production processes, and in the repeated inspections is to keep costs under Dubský million crowns.
Production processes to change every year.
They are more precise and more stringent.
We have to doškolovat employees, retrofitted device and again the whole process of becoming certified, delivering the outcome.
Now company is finishing the preparation process for plating zinc and nickel, which will replace the existing for human health of harmful cadmium.
Although the award received from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology for equipment or chemicals which are used in Prague.
People arriving from Boeing, examines the concept of the whole line.
Then the production of the show.
Check also our laboratory.
One set samples test yourself in your laboratory and then compare the results with our, presents the outcome of the way in which subscribers control.
The reward are the Prague company, long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague race stands today and the production of embraerů.
For the A320 aircraft produced half of the total volume of the door.
Replace the Czech Latecoere is for Brazilian or European manufacturer either impossible, or very difficult.
This does not mean, however, that the door could mean any price.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
This indicates how much the door State after ten, fifty, hundred produced pieces.
The price for a piece of the still falling to a specific limit value.
To this the price formula need to come in.
If not, we will be losing money, says the outcome.
Half of the Hall, where the assembled electrical cabinets for military aircraft, Airbus A400 M, is still empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the curtain here is building a new polorobotická line on the riveting and Assembly of doors for the upgraded model of the A320 Neo.
Riveting accelerates and refines.
"This is a trend which is mounting in aviation goes," adds the outcome.
The disposal has secured the future of the line.
Airbus reports that airlines have not yet commissioned A320 model 3278 new pieces.
Just a few meters next to the line arises for a complete installation of the door for the upper deck of the A380.
It is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to shorten the time of production and reduce costs.
Full installation could begin within two years, says the outcome.
Before that, however, must pass the skill tests should be firm for the installation of certain electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the biggest Airbus.
The company is betting on a further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to the Boeing should also participate in the new program of the Airbus A350, which will compete with American Dreamlineru.
"It's huge for a company credit, when she can handle in addition to metallic materials and composites," he says proudly, the outcome.
Latecoere, however, in the Czech Republic to the edge of the production capacity.
In the premises of Letov, home, another place is not.

MEPs have supported a larger share of the State charges for coal.
Change in fees for the extraction of minerals is to bring to the Treasury about 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
On revenue budgets of municipalities is to have a neutral impact, according to the Government, because the fee to be higher.
In předloňském year have completed the village of roughly 450 million crowns and the State budget of 150 million dollars.
From the mining of brown coal was about 200 million crowns to the municipalities and the State of 66 million kroner.
The amendment also with an increase in the remuneration of the mining space-enabled mining at one thousand crowns per hectare per year.
Income from these payments is still in full scale belong to municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) members said that municipalities receive annually because of this, instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining taxes will no longer determine the law, but it provides for government regulation.
Reimbursement is calculated as the product of the quantity of newly mined mineral and rates for individual types of minerals.
According to the Government, is the reason for the changes, inter alia, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
Member of the ODS Marek Benda but warned that setting a fee by regulation of the Government may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to the Minister of Mládka, in this case about the tax, because the State will charge for the mineral, which is State property.
The fees they receive only the municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of underground coal mining will get three-fourths of the money the village and a quarter of the State.
The same ratio will be even in the case of the mining of radioactive minerals.
Part of the money, which the State on charges of exploitation, will be assigned the bound.
For example, 28 percent of it will have to go on repairing the damage after extraction or to ensure the mine rescue service.
The draft today criticized the opposition deputies, who argued in particular that damaged the village affected by mining and the region.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and mayors) warned that the mining company will not want to patronize the municipality so as yet, because they will pay higher fees directly to the State budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions only to the Minister of Finance's budget, making things better," said David Kádner (Dawn) selected in the Ústí nad Labem region.

Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to reject the law wanted to return Government Kučera for completion.
In the explanatory memorandum, in accordance with the mining companies, the increase in charges will in the prices of coal, because the prices are more than 90 percent of the contracted on a long-term basis.
The main consumers as power plants or heating plants would therefore not increase in prices.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that remittances will increase mining organizations to compensate for the effort to reduce its operating expenses, which would primarily meant the reduction of number of employees," admits the Government.
It is, however, the increase in charges in terms of employment of the subcontinent.
According to the rapporteur to amendment by Milan Urban (ČSSD) is the key to MEPs before the approval of the law knew the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and mainly the decision of the Government on the limits for coal mining.
If coal will benefit as well as the limits, then this will have an impact on revenue for the State and the community, he stressed.
Urban disagree with Mládkem in that the decision on breaking the limit on the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should be made up to the year 2020.
Limits on the bottom of the CSA would, according to him, should break down have for reasons of social, national and because of the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Time for a decision on interest rates, the u.s. Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching how the us Federal Reserve prepares to meet for two days on Wednesday and Thursday, to make a crucial decision about whether to raise interest rates for the first time after nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve will make a decision, now thinks that remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It is a historic event, because years passed from the time the sat, when the Fed cut rates to zero.
The first time we are approaching a situation where the main Central Bank might be able to get out of a zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates, "says Angel Ubide, Executive of the Peterson Institute for international economics.
The u.s. economy performed relatively well, there was a recovery in the form of adding a trillion dollars on the State account and create only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore less pink, global perspective.
Warned the markets that they were prepared to increase, but the circumstances suggest that also sees great chances against such a step.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday, 20:00 CET.
Shooter on the Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who on Monday shot his girlfriend in the Mississippi-and later the same day and his colleague-he wrote a message in which he claims that he was "sorry" the first murder and that he wishes to take back, revealed Tuesday the Government offices.
Police in Gautieru, Mississippi, said that the Lamb, a teacher of geography and social sciences on the Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning about ten o'clock
and he said that he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send police officers to his home.
He said: "last night I shot my wife" and also mentioned that the House is "cute dog", which "will not bother anyone," but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb is introduced.
Lamb also did not explain why the shots were fired in the House.
When police arrived on the scene, found the body of the 41leté Amy Prentissové and a handwritten note from Lamba, stating: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could take back.
I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me. "
After leaving a message with the Lamb on 300 mile long road to College Delta, where history teacher killed Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
The Dean of the University's William LaForge said that he did not know of any conflict between the Café and Schmidt, but that "in the title of Mr. Lamba is obviously something going on".
Despite Monday's statement about that Lamb reportedly believed in a romantic relationship, Amy Prentissové, the Schmidt Government offices indicated that a "love triangle" there is "no evidence".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married with Prentissovou over seven years, said that it was "a great person".
The divorce occurred 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
19letá daughter of O'Steena and Prentissové was the whole case "shaken".
O'Steen said that Prentissová and her daughter were "best friends".
By Linsday Knowlesové, a close friend of Prentissové, as stated by the Sun Herald, worked for Prentissová from home via the internet.
Knowles said that Prentissová, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, went with the Café about three years.
"I always wanted to help others" left to hear Knowles.
Police said that the Lamb on Monday talked with their relatives and said that he "will not go to jail."
When police caught up with him on the Highway near Greenville later that same night, Lamb stopped and fled into the forest, where he shot himself.
According to the biography, published on the website of the school, won the Lamb on a doctorate in education at the University of the Delta in the spring of 2015.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be a few months out of the game due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right foot during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left Defender left this injury in tears and knocked him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and think that Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury caused the ruthless crackdown Héctora Morena in 15. minute, when 20 Shaw pushed into the space of the PSF.
Nine minutes later he was treated on the pitch and was also needed oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "he suffered a double fracture of his leg and is now in the hospital."
Will be taken tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then on operated in Manchester.
It is terrible-a boy who comes to Manchester in the 18 years it is very hard, but playing fantastically and then this is what happens.
When he was in the locker room, he was also wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but the double fracture of the leg will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I believe that this season's still plays.
Moreno was lucky to get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli Mexican nepotrestala.
Van Gall hinted that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge whether it was a penalty kick and a red card.
It was a very ugly intervention with both feet.
Tweet from your account Shaw says: "thank you to everyone for their messages, words cannot express how I ruined my road to recovery begins now and come back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United have recorded the injuries Luke Shaw in the defeat against PSV
English Defender will have added incentive to the recovery in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "it was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaving the field with such injuries, each of which is very sad.
There is never a goal our players hurt.
Moreno suffered a broken leg during a match for Mexico against the Van Gaalově in the Netherlands at the World Cup in 2014.
"It's very hard for him, because his intention was not to hurt an opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," said Cocu.
I wasn't able to spot this time.
I saw only the ball that was heading in the other direction, so it seemed, that he [Moreno] touched, but I haven't seen a crackdown on Luke.
In an interview for the SBS6 said Moreno: "I know how she feels, I know how difficult it can be such a thing.
I feel very badly, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after the procedure Chris Smallinga.
David Cameron certainly knows The Lorax better?
This thing every parent knows: when the baby falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long before she learns almost by heart.
However, this may not be David Cameron.
On the query poskytovatelky the children's schedules, to appoint the popular children's book, he chose Prime Minister vows the Lorax, by Dr. Seuss, 1971.
It was hard to choose, writes Cameron in the report published on the website of the company SuperCamps, and continues: "Funny, touching, creative and strong content, so I love to read to their children, because it was always a picture or message, which I've seen before."
Well, up to nato, in the following paragraph Cameron allegedly described the plot of the book by the lift from the movie of the year 2012, which added more characters and details to fill the brief original text.
"In the walls of the walled Thneed-Ville, where all of nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes that gets the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey by her desire to see a real tree," is a brief content of the book, which records the object of love is unknown, Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that alone wasn't enough suspicious text supplied Cameron reads like a summary of lift, which is the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "Thneed-Ville in the city's walls, where all of nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes that gets the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was openly a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron did with the plot of the book, where the unnamed young man learns that devastates the local nature of avaricious, trees toppling the Once-ler industrialista that despite the protests of the title Loraxe, whip, kníratého creature, which "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, so relatively few significant PR task got Assistant that never read Lorax child 20 times in a row.
A spokesman for 10 Downing Street said that the text probably came from the Office of Cameron's supporters.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text provided by an employee of Cameron's, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was the omission of England, but still holds the
Compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England has chosen on this tour, will repeat the 3-0 defeat suffered in a test series last time, not very likely.
I'd also put itself winning reviews.
Alastaira Cook's Party may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup and also the collective mindset is strong; bear the scars of the year's 2012, only the youthful positivity.
With the ball is the spinner Moeen Ali emerging and Adil Rashid, although it is unknown on the level of the test series, represents the offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of the England team in the senior series and was replaced by Alex Halesem.
Decision forget Adam Lytha is a tough one for me to analyze, because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests was against two good attacks in the demanding conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, by the name of Joe Root were no question marks, which led to the announcement, because — and this I've featured previously — players are your best selectors.
Yet a few other half-century and could extend the series Lyth, but had control over their own destiny.
Hopefully, when he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, will appear with another opportunity.
Head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performances were not completely 100 percent, and it does not surprise me; It was always a team player.
The question of how much of the test of the time he gets to show Batman, is a hard nut to crack.
Lyth got seven caps — as well as Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton has earned nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outside.
The only thing you could gripe is that England gave the Caribbean first chance Jonathan Trottovi — although the Lyth was in top form — but this promrhaná opportunity is already past.
Here comes Alex Hales, and it is Batman, which I evaluate very positively.
It is x-faktorový cricketer, whom we have seen here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he won against us at Trent Bridge pitch 236, that so little was done.
He must at least be afforded the same opportunity, what got his predecessors, but all this will of course depend on the overall report, in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, when Moeen starts alongside Cook, who would gain an extra spinner while maintaining four quicks, was raised and I don't have reservations against it.
I don't see why this can't bat and strokemaker left-handed man already showed that it is an amazing cricketer.
Moeen perhaps fails to do its job for his County, Worcestershire, but number 3 was for them and a big difference in that.
My former teammate Justin Langer, playing his first test in front of his first 38 performances in 2001.
Immediately have three centuries and not looking back.
The team comes Zafar Ansari as a backup when the spinner and I had the opportunity to watch him, intrigued me as a very impressive young man.
People can watch his gross average statistics — 31 and 35 with the bat with the ball — and I see it as a punt, but not a lot of spinnerů, who lifted their hands and selektoři have opted for youth.
A lot of that on this tour.
Outside of the team, it seems that England made several changes and a smart supplement their helpful staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardenea, '' from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches can be a master stroke.
He is one of the most beautifully playing guys who bring a wealth of experience that they have experience with all of the terms and conditions and all of the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in the part of the tour, white-ball and will bring to the team as the energy, so ruthless.
I've always felt that he was born into a world of itself international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and as well as Mahela has intellect, you can take advantage of.
New voices in the locker room, even though they are voices saying consistent things that have been said here before, can sometimes to lighten and freshen up the atmosphere.
Teammate Collyho Durhama Ben Stokes got the day off, as well as Root got a similar break against Australia and I with this decision, I have no problem.
Although many do not agree on it, the coaches and the selektoři do not create a schedule.
And you must remember, as the players, their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
Brexit campaign could prevail, unless the economy begins to stagnate by 2017.
An ill-conceived strategy renegotiations David Cameron for keeping Britain in the EU are getting into other problems with each passing day without even the election of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" CORBYN to lead the Labour Party, or the TUC's take on Tuesday to deal with the whole situation around Europe.
Foreigners also have their Corbyna and Nigel Faragese.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe mired in various crises-not all of which are their fault-some Member States have had enough of British egocentric agenda, dividing the concessions and disturbing changes in the Treaty that mostly did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC has decided that they don't want it even if they dented social protection.
We can even call it a selfie agenda Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor goes on the summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, they picture in front of the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then returns home with the words that win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to nezahleděnou themselves in the European Europe Britain-"don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin-suggests that some shortsighted Ministers and officials in some of the major cities has gotten to the point where it doesn't matter to them on our departure.
Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, carefully balanced is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years, and wants to leave his post, than for her to become bad, as was the case too long continued Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl's (16).

It is difficult to watch, how do you break your feet when you help Selfie the British, who could better invest your energy to prevent Scotland leaving the UK-which is something they don't want themselves, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these Ministers can plan deliberately unhelpful comments style SNP during the referendum campaign in Great Britain, 2017 that hastened the process of Brexit, says a friend.
"Renegotiation" and "solve the problem Britain has nothing of value from the negotiations."
The Europeans to their own detriment, they know how fierce can a Fleet Street and sceptical of the EU press barons are the oligarchs during the referendum, because they were not inspired by Tony Bennem in 1975, that supported our entry in 1973 at a ratio of 2:1.
They can remember vaguely name Boris Johnson, úskočného Euro-oportunistu, who made his name as a Brussels correspondent "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite their vanity Ed Miliband knew their enemies.
Included a medley of villains neplatících taxes, foreigners hackujících phones and pseudo nezámořské departments, which owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, the thought of them, Tony Blair thought the same thing, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a frenzied Gorilla, you throw a banana to give you to dinner and then to a tea.
In fact, it was more like Blair than Miliband himself when Blair said Cameron's referendové routine, what since Blair admitted the principle of the repealed Constitution of the EU, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005, and won him the card being gone.
Print it too never forgave him.
But Dear Jeremy Corbyn, who on Monday in Westminster patted my back-I told him that he must not waste time on me-it seems to be in danger of accepting strategy of boycott Murdoch reuse Neil Kinnocka, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but needs to develop a coherent strategy's engagement with the media, not with me, but I'm sure with Andrew Marrem, whose seat on the BBC on Sunday.
Corbinův the official attitude toward Europe is, I'll tell the mile, develops.
Claims that he wanted to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the frantic tendency of Ukip and the wild shores of Toryho small Englanderismu the it can proceed.
The same thing she told Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on the radio and television this week, when his internal Scout couldn't bring herself to admit that the appointment of McDonnella as Corbynovo-off shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70 's. for years, when his old father fought on television about his loyalty, without went too far and lost his job.
Match Hillary was much more attractive.
But the fight for us to stay "in all circumstances"-Bennina phrases-apparently it was what McDonnell said, nor what JC said colleagues and the members of their private meeting on Monday evening,
Whatever the background, the fine image that wants to communicate, Corbyn-remember me-touched and discipline reports remains important in the ages television a day and especially in faith, forcing paranoia and betrayal, which are social media
It is fair not to Appear free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider support for the workers ' Party in the referendové campaign for granted, said McDonnell.
Simon Jenkins, it's definitely thinks.
But McDonnellovo and Corbynovo basic equivocation about the membership in the EU in accordance with their Bennite besieging anti-capitalist economy of the past-it is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion between left-wing dissidents, for that is the essence of narcissism of small differences, the Central doctrinal squabbles.
As well as with the Nato vykrucováním-Tom Watson is confident that the campaign will not want to stop it, JC-foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for your home.
Why should Paris or Berlin to spend political capital-have also suspected the voters because of the concessions Britain, when it seems pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed of the briského "a weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the cost-cutting Conservative Government in power, as I was admonished on Monday the start of something, what was the name of a Security Forum of British influence.
Experts criticize the review published on the electronic Public Health Agency England
Statement by the Government-funded agency that electronic cigarettes are about 95% safer than smoking, came from a meeting of 12 people, some of which have links with the tobacco industry, State researchers.
The experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) join the Lancet critique of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by the Agency of the Public Health of England (PHE).
PHE Agency published a "mezníkovou" message last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers questioned the robustness of the data, and highlighted the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely flimsy base", on which the agency based its main conclusions of PHE.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ, questioned the claim, which was allegedly "built on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "the basic principle is that public health policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
Indicate that the general public might expect, that is a statement of the Agency, which sounds PHE "current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of the evidence, and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a single meeting was convened to draw up 12 people analysis of multi-decision criteria (MCDA) model to synthesize its opinions on the harm associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell States that a sponsor of this meeting, the company was named EuroSwiss Health whose Director General reportedly has previously received financial resources from British American Tobacco for the independent study.
Also approved the mandate of public health in report on sustainability, he says.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting acknowledged the funding from the manufacturers of electronic cigarettes, but not funding, which reportedly earned previously from the tobacco companies, Philip Morris International, delivered.
The reason for the selection of the members of the Panel is not available, but contain several known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of which also in the newspaper claim industrial financing.
Some of the other participants at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in the PHE also participated in the tobacco executives.
The report resulting from this group "eloquently admits," the missing "hard evidence on the harmfulness of a majority of products on most criteria," written by McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or the restriction is described in the report of PHE.
McKee and Capewell said that the allegation that PHE, "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes as the path to smoking for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of health and welfare in the PHE, stated that the allegation in the BMJ was answered before.
He said: "electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence indicates that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we need to continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not appearing, especially when so many public confusion about the relative risk compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80 000 people a year die from diseases related to smoking and smoking costs NHS £ 2 billion a year.
A clear emphasis on the current evidence-that even though e-cigarettes are not without risk, bear only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking-we fulfill our national responsibility.
The BBC should end up with EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
Former Director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop airing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would be a "right hand" behind the hit show as Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should be used only for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcast.
He criticized the BBC for that, she put on the programs of the public service, which is likely to follow only a handful of people in the complex of broadcasting times compared to its rivals ' biggest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After generálně Director Tony Hall said that corporations want to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said, that he tried without success to join with the BBC for six years, he worked on Channel 4.
"I'm struggling with the idea that the BBC enters and broadcasts programs that would surely have been broadcast rivals without the contributions of the State," Johnson said in the Commission for communication in the upper House, as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you retain the license fees, which I'm not sure whether they are in the medium or long term, good idea, should be reduced, at least as regards the creation of programs that the other does not produce or do.
The Voice broadcast in prime time, because they want to gain the widest possible support in the future.
The idea that no one else could it broadcast, is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, absurd.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why the regressive tax should support programs that can be funded by bezpříspěvkově.
The Voice is one of them, and, of course, another, EastEnders made on home soil.
Frankly, other channels they could feel free right hand.
I can't understand how the public broadcasting service.
I don't think that it would be in the slightest weakening the BBC.
Johnson, a businessman in the area, which led the series Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that she feels guilty that overhauling ratings "due to the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed that it is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comment about the most popular show of the BBC repeated the ones that former Executive Director of Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, that suggested that the BBC sells shows such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the hýčkanější programs of the public service of the BBC "on BBC4, which quite often could not measure the audience, but fulfilling its power and can argue, when preparing for their self-righteous mission to justify the £ 4bn of income from royalties," but of course we do all these obscure, programs that no one is looking. "
Broadcast is at a time when no one is looking at them.
As for the license fee, the Commission said Johnson: "I challenge you to find a regresivnější system about who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that the 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people, for which £ 150 is a lot, I would be surprised if they paid that much, because they don't look so much at the BBC.
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who spoke before the Commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its reithovskou Mission in the sense of "to inform, educate and entertain."
Confirmed that the small volume of production, the BBC has now been previously classified as educational-it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% on the radio-and should take as a model the public public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, explain and entertain."
To see the partnership Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which was in a television broadcast only a handful, and connect with the commercial reporters, so we all could see online.
"Sonogenetika," or control of brain cells by using sound waves
This video shows how the sound impulses affect the direction in which the nematode.
Scientists raised the worms with genetically modified nervous system that can control the sound waves.
Tiny nematode changes direction at the moment when they are affected by sound pulses, which are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work so that switch cells genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
The scientists said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetika, which uses ultrasound to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells and activates the outside of the body.
Chalasani, Sreekanth researchers from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said the Guardian, for the journal that this method could one day replace the deep brain stimulation-invasive procedure in which they are added to the patient's brain electrodes that stimulate the brain. Method is used e.g.. to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
The nematode normally do not respond on the ultrasound, but found that the reaction of Chalasani, when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
How to find out the bubbles intensify ultrasonic waves, which then passes through the body of the worm.
Intensified ultrasound waves operate in ion channels TRP-4, which is located in the membranes of certain cells of the worm.
Thanks to the sound of the waves, these channels open and activate the cells with which they are associated, it is reported in the journal Nature report Communications.
In order to control nematode using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms, so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.
When used on the modified worms, ultrasound, sound waves are amplified by the mikrobublinami and transferred to worms, where the motion of the modified motor neurons.
The new method is very similar to optogenetice, the groundbreaking instrument, which scientists allows you to switch on and off neurons using light.
Chalasani said, however, that the sonogenetika could have many advantages compared with this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent to the place of the optical fibre in the brain, ultrasound waves penetrate tissues may without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target the human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasonic signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," said Chalasani.
He added that its application would also found the method in the treatment of muscle cells and the cells producing insulin.

Advertisements have a British trade in arms.

Formidable zabijáčtí droni!
The shackles on his legs that break their ankles!
Incendiary projectiles!
And electric stun batons, causing excruciating pain, but left no tracks!
A cheerful voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advertising on the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International for highlighting the British Government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defense and security devices International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

By Gavin Grindona, curator of the Cruel Designs and an Assistant at the University of Essex, artists increasingly are questioning and trying to show political activity among the spectators Gallery.

Video on Facebook of Amnesty was viewed more than 100 000 people in 24 hours, and was created by the Agency VCCP working without compensation and a graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
Creative Director of VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised at the silence surrounding the ads about the arms trade-he saw an empty space in the calendar for ExCeL-and thought: "Let's show them the campaign, which is trying to avoid."
Toyed with by creating a more realistic risky corporate ads, but "by adding bright colors and animation, I have that will capture the attention of more people."
"They did a fantastic job and helped us raise concerns about the sale of nelegálích torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in the Amnesty.
What we need now, is that the Government of the United Kingdom has taken measures and ensure that their facilities are not dealt with illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the trade in arms comes from within Excel, where exhibitors sell the fantastic eufemistické products.

This includes "the uniquely shaped head, which provides amazing effects from behind armor inside the goal."

Eight golden rules for living on a student dorm
11 years ago I moved to the student dormitory as the oblivious kid, nineteen, is still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but until now there's a tense smiles of those whom I kind-and numerous, lengthy complaints on the other.
Everything I've learned may be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on the tracks can range from mildly irritating to totally-appalling.
It is tempting to babble: tell people where you're from, if you took a year hiatus, what's your opinion on Corbyna and why "honestly you don't love or hate Marmite, not just because of the people, it is only an extract of yeast, HAHAHA, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to also air-ask and manifestation of the interest.
It controls the conversation and will help you find the people that you love, and those with whom you had fun even if your lashes were on fire and they would pose fire extinguishers.
Let the people of the area.
The rooms people are often changed to popíjecí, the place of movie nights and communal public places, but they're also the rooms in which people dress and underwear.

Introverts on high come in short.
Your bedroom should be a sanctuary, but a lot of the tracks changed to mimopokojovou walking culture that is friendly, sociable, and contributes to the life-long friendship.
It can be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture does not allow you to say "I love you and I want to continue our friendship, but I need you to leave, to return to power, which I vypotřeboval to talk with you."
Try to recognize when a classmate is tired of socialization-and maybe write him instead of the knock.
Speaking about knocking: click.
One guy in my Rails had a habit of that, if the door is not locked, is invited in.
Saw a couple of things.
Take your friends thanks to the baking.
Because you started to walk to the University at the top of the baking mania, knock on doors and performances with baked scones breastplate seems slightly less odd, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, something I've made, now smile while I'm going to ask personal questions."
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to find friends.
Your roommate will feel obliged to speak with you and maybe everything will end so that your face will assign to a delicious surprise.
It is, of course, the subject that you are a decent Baker.
Wrong condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and probably hard to be zaruší other pretend to sleep, when you try to knock them on the door.
Theft is a common crime in the student residences.
The theft of the whole chicken is, of course, a crime, but it is a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Double check with the owner of the milk.
There is a chance that you will be offered even if the milk inside the berserk.
If someone steals something, it's annoying and you have my sympathy-but try to deal with it a little bit more mature than my roommate, who exchanged their milk for washing detergent to punish thieves.
Now he is in prison.
You shouldn't make noises that abolishes the people from sleep or study.
It is not just to be a decent human being, but you also have people in glass houses.
The girl from my corridor asked his neighbors if they could keep it down a little bit of drum and bass, because they were 3 at night and in the morning she had a quiz.
Their answer was the amplification of music.
When finally utichli in 5 o'clock in the morning, let them sleep for two hours and then let out loud his own music, locked the door and left on his three-hour test.
It would be romantic if your future spouse went to the same College as you?
And on the contrary, it would not be terribly embarrassing if you mistook a roommate for his future wife, slept together, broke up and having to see each other every day and perhaps took control of your common friends?
Of course, the heart of the neporučíš-but if your roommate is not a 100% sexy your future wife, try to get at least a little talk with their weaknesses.
In the pattern when you realize that someone left the keys in their nezamčeném room, is only a fine line between fun and bullying.
A good prank is funny, but easy to fix.
Learn is a valuable and entertaining lesson about their security by giving them something to hide don't destroy somebody's never room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the doors and give them the keys to the bottle with water, and then stick it in the freezer-they do not stick but never their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva on the twins enjoyed despite uncertain prospects in the future.
Eva had a hard time already during pregnancy with today seven Vit.
His father broke up with her, and on the training and upbringing of the child was alone.
Manages I cope fairly quickly-I was looking forward to the baby, and I was looking for the positives in it.
Uncertainty and the fact that I'll be alone with a child, I was bothering.
And I'm sure I should hope that we will not stay a long time alone, she recalls today Eva on her first pregnancy.
Then she met on the Internet in chat earlier Vašek, which started to talk about your favorite films.
Vašek Eve with Vitek even imported home from the hospital, but the role of step-Daddy is uneasy.
"For some time, then downloaded from the program," described the Eva in the documentary series, Four in the 3.
The motive of the third series of the Czech television series is just the pursuit of happiness on the second attempt.
Care of Vítek and financial security of the family had to work part-time and great help moms and aunts of the bailout.
Even the prospect of liability for foreign child eventually Vaškovu affection for Eva nepokazily.
Finally got together around the Vítkových second birthday and he now understands the Vaška as my dad and also appeals to him.
Even though he has two adult daughters Vašek, fatherhood in the 60 's in his own words he uses and children more.
In addition to Vítek was a two-year to them and, ultimately, Tigist twins.
"Nazir to our family drifted so naturally, maybe even the fact that my mother never spoke to the relations," he thinks he's smiling.
Little space?
At least we get close.
Twins Emma and Ela was born cesarean section after it was diagnosed at the end of Eva pregnancy Cholestasis of pregnancy.
It is a disorder of the production and activities of bile acids, which are then in excessive quantities occur in the blood of pregnant women and, in particular, are itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which threatens to premature birth and death, for mothers after childbirth usually subsides spontaneously.
EMA and Ela to Evie's and Vaškovu of happiness were born healthy, although there were only 36. week.
Emičku placed in the incubator for the intermediární Department, where he works and Vaškova niece, she managed to take over and stay.
Nawar was larger and right after the transfer from the ICU to the room I had it together, describes the challenging period after the birth of Eva.
In the maternity ward spent twenty days, until doctors nesvolili with the release of the babies, meanwhile, managed to reach the borders of two pounds.
Waiting for the gain of children in maternity hospitals Eve joy but didn't.
"I was the crazy thing after her husband and children," recalls the difficult moments on the Department of puerperium-1 mother.
My husband and i thought about signing reversu, inter alia, because of the necitlivému of access to one of the doctors.
To do this, but in the end there and the doctors got out with the twins to Eve home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births sends Ct1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45 hours.
In total, a large family can uskromnit.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric dvouplotýnkou and through narrow terms.
The House did, but Vašek did Eve pleasure mounting the gas stove to prepare meals for six people more comfortable.
When nejůř, we will be taking turns on a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive, in particular, family well-being and pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or omšelost.
For now we are passing very nice, better than we expected.
The mess, while harder to hide in a small space and kutalející with babies sometimes crossing, but at least we're all around, smiling, which is able to find a positive side to every situation.
Vaškova work light for the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
Therefore, occasionally hitting the road in the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In its 60 years, according to his words, the care of the family's finances and children physically, but how long it will be?
"I realize that due to our age difference, I will once I, who will feed his family," admits the Eva on the plane when querying for the future.
She returned to work, but even more it attracts the possibility of your own business.
With four children, I'm not exactly a moneymaker for the employer.
And when necessary, we can take turns with her husband about a cab, joking nice blonde.
Apple suffered the yo-yo effect.
For everything they can display.
A more powerful processor, a camera with a larger resolution, stronger chassis, or display, which recognize the power of a touch, it is in a nutshell the virtues of the recently introduced the ninth generation of the iPhone.
The last two, then they also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6 Plus.
The current trend of Apple is that each new generation of the iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception were only the third and fourth generation, whose weight has increased slightly compared to the previous iPhonům.
2 g weight of the difference to the detriment of the news was really negligible.
However, this new iPhone is far from the case.
From last year's iPhonům 6 and 6 Plus the weight is small because the model has grown about 14 grams, with a larger then a full 20 grams.
On the one hand, you cannot blame last year's affair in their pockets considerably by bending the Apple potrápila.
The chassis is so robust news from aluminum alloy 7000, which is also reflected on the weight.
But a much bigger impact on her to display.
Apple has used the technology for 3D news Touch, thanks to which the display recognize the power of touch.
To do this it was necessary to obtain the display another layer of capacitive sensors.
Mass displays of new iPhone so compared to previous generations has increased more than twice.
For the smaller iPhone from the originally 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of larger then from 19 to 40 grams.
The iPhone screen is so 6s the toughest used by the component.
Weight only 143 grams, it is then for this news reached also thanks to the crust, which is slimming down, touched on most of the remaining components.
For a larger model is then the hardest element used batteries, its weight, however, compared to predecessors did not.
Even in this case, so the biggest increase evident for the display.
Weight 5.5 "iPhone 6s Plus reaches 192 grams.
How much will the new display technology, practical, to take effect in the application.
First it's users will be able to try on Friday to 25. September, when it will be in the selected countries launched the sale of the iPhone 6s and 6 Plus.
Flakes of breakfast of Champions are already tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists made the discovery, which opens up interesting possibilities.
Discover the traces of the settlement of modern humans from various periods, including wall paintings, tools and so on and so forth.
In the layer 23A, which according to instruments dated to before about 30 thousand years ago, but scientists have discovered something very reminiscent of the remnants of the breakfast buffet.
On the spot had indeed found traces of oat grains that look obviously went through a process of production now so popular.
When it is first soaked grain today, then dried, get rid of the packaging. pluch, then spaří and rozlisují flat.
In the cave Paglicci managed to discover the grain, which was by all accounts, nahřáta or spařena, and then apparently crushed between two millstones-at least indicate traces of use on two rocks in the cave.
Scientists have therefore failed in its publication for magazine PNAS prove that the cave was a complete process of production of flakes, but the resemblance is actually very obvious.
We don't have any evidence about how people could eat the flakes, but the presumption that it was with some liquid and perhaps warm, of course, offers a completely logical.
At the same time it is a very interesting document of how intensely people used cereals long before the creation of agriculture.
If it is the correct interpretation, the oldest Flake flakes ahead of agriculture roughly twenty thousand years.
New reporting stations in the transport undertaking city of Brno.
So I listened again to report the names of the stops in a trolley-bus: Hnusáčkova, Phantom, Frázova, Spratecká.
Certainly, the trolleybus was somewhat noisier, so reports the male voice was somewhat less comprehensible than before, when the station reported the woman's voice.
A woman's voice is higher, so the traffic noise in deeper is better recognizable than a deeper male voice.
Although the TROLLEY DEPOT DPMB argues that this broadcaster chose the passengers themselves-I don't know who, I ask no one, but it certainly chose from Studio recordings taken in complete silence, which of course sounded quite differently than in the noise of the bus engine.
I live in Brno, quite a few years, so the correct names of all those zastávkek I know by heart, so I don't need this information, but foreigners from elsewhere who are in Brno and for which they are unfamiliar, this report primarily intended, may be confused and may on the final, where they arrived by mistake, then argue that the station, which had to withdraw was not reported.
Perhaps the choice of broadcaster-but again-it's better to do it again, and this time tinged with normal traffic noise and the noise of the engine, in which the kuňkání of the speaker on the bus almost lost.
We have to keep listening to the names of the stations, Water, Šmírova, Saratoga or Submersible in the creaking šalině then I transferred in Komárov.
I suppose that my ear had worsened suddenly gets so much during that one day, when the announcer stops changed.
Before the day I understand the message quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From scraps traťováka.
Today, few people know what a government party the biggest and smartest were called. a comprehensive review.
I took the liberty to reminisce.
The bus was late.
I bumped into the dispatcher's Office at the time, when there was a radio, that is just seven hours.
"You're lucky that you have hit the Chief comrade, came a minute before you, and it seems that it is not just in the mood," said the dispatcher, while I was writing the book arrivals.
Thanks, I'll watch it.
Write me, that I'm going after the revision of the small districts of mechanization.
It won't work, today there are audits.
They are all from the sober to the horror.
What's really going on?
"You'll see," said the dispatcher.
Next you'll be too.
I ran out into the hallway.
Suddenly the door opened, and the Chief of the náčelnikárny.
Stiff, with a stone face, perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Master Chief," I said politely and quickly turned on the two buttons on the jacket uniforms.
"Good morning," came the reply, and I quickly ran to the second floor, I realized without cold, sinister tone, which the old, he said.
"You're dealing with," welcomed me engineer Eva, an elderly lady, which I appreciated.
Apparently even was the Chief than her comrades were deposed.
Are checks and those you barely.
How many times have I asked, what are you a comprehensive review, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
He says tend to be once every three years, must all of them, and it's pretty annoying.
At least for some.
However, they said.
I pulled out a drawer of files in with periodic reports and then the phone.
"Come Here right now, Holcman to me," said the Chief's voice.
What annoys you?
We met and now nothing... "I muttered, but nobody answered, each only with his thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I came to your command," omeldoval I, as I entered the náčelnikárny.
The Chief was sitting at a desk and looking at some Clipboard.
"Comrade mechanizátore," he said after a moment, without looking up, and still carefully examining this clipboard, "your attitude I don't like."
He threw down his Clipboard on the table, leaning on the arm of the Chair and stared at me was mesmerized by the usual, unpleasant, evil, order.
I hesitated again.
What's going on?
Yesterday's Deputy, said that for a few months in Office I have worked very well and is very happy with me.
The Chief did very well when he pulled out of me the squads on the distance.
And now this?
Remember that you're a technician track Division and according to you have to behave.
Such a greeting, how you used this morning, is simply unacceptable.
I stammered that I use such a greeting from my childhood that I was brought up and that I don't see anything wrong with it.
The Chief, it was like a red rag to the Turkey.
"You're a Socialist rail and the only appropriate greeting is an honor," said Chief Arthur Hailey.
And, in addition, still wrong salutation superiors.
Once you say "Sir" and "Comrade" again for the second time.
But I'm no Mr. Chief, but comrade Chief.
Deputy Heads deputy heads are the comrades, the top traťmistři top traťmistři are comrades!
Please memorize it!
Excuse me, Sir ... Comrade Chief, but ... but I'm greeted by ordinary civil greeting.
On it there is nothing wrong ... and it's an honor to work, or comrade ... you know ... I'm not in the side.
"It's not your preference, you're not in the side," said the Chief of the cold, which had calmed down.
However, even about the speech.
Anyway, remember that the Chair at the top you have a subscription to retirement.
It was not good.
When the Chief said, to someone that something is not his priority, with that it didn't look good.
For a moment, glared at me with cold eyes and under the words I was looking for, which I answered.
Also it really pained me his patronizing tykání.
He was just a few years older and played at Lord's, actually soudruhaboha.
Jovial, cocky, arrogant, authoritarian, as he is currently.
Him all often chosen as godparents.
Well, it's the Chief.
Actually, not all, Chairman of the all party organizations as straníkům, but also nestraníkům, besides.
But he called the Chief for many, especially those in which he could assert their superiority.
Right now, me wiping away the complete crap.
I thought something about the fucked up and it cost me aggravation enough to shoot him in the face.
But it would not to štreky to the picks, let alone to keep doing overhead.
What I would support my two kids?
And under the House!
I was crying, but I restrained myself.
The joy of him again.
"That's all, you can go," an audience with the Chief and began to carefully view the Clipboard again, which had been in his hands.
At half-past eleven I've subpoenaed.
All of the offices were already there and on the questions of what and how they answered, yeah, that will be good.
Only Kristi pointedly said, as was his habit, that they can't carry us all, because the work had to do with the Chief comrade loyal, and that there is no danger.
The word "Comrade" while stressed, as if he knew me in the morning what the old wiped away.
In náčelnikárně was a nice reunion.
Comrade Chief behind his desk at a long table and other comrades who should decide about my rather being or non-being.
Personnel manager, Chairman of the CNR, from the personnel, technical officer for special purposes, something on the way to kontráše, and the Deputy in the army, my boss.
And also the most important person, the Chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from štreky.
An ordinary track worker, podbíjel sleepers or Pitchfork throwing gravel.
But also a former warder.
There were rumours that back then it used to be fun, beautiful beast.
Evil tongues claimed that the school came out in seventh grade, no nevyučil, nothing could.
And when the jail canceled, ended up on the štrece with a Pickaxe.
But comrade, Yes, comrade was forged.
The Chief motioned for me to sit down.
It was in me uneasy, in the neck nespolknutelná cone.
Read a testimonial from a personnel manager of the civic Committee of the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I am married, two children, and so on and so on.
So far so good, I thought, and I did rather better.
Then the opinion of the street party organization.
The copy of the judgement of the civil Committee, perhaps the same man wrote both of them.
But then it came!
The parents of longtime party members, refused to appear before the prověrkovou Commission, and subsequently by the speakers, reportedly for health reasons.
The Chief looked at me sharply.
Personnel manager noticed and stopped reading.
The Chief nodded, that has to continue.
This was worse.
I was a member of the town Committee, and there I was obtained for the party candidate.
Regardless of the parents, who spoke from the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and the wedding, in addition to the National Committee, I was also in the Church.
The confidence of the parties I disappointed in the worst way.
That's why I was deleted from the ranks of its candidates.
But that was not enough!
I left the two children baptized, and even my mother when she died, I went the Church funeral, although it was a former member of the party.
All this I found a negative attitude to the leading role of the party.
When finished, only the personnel manager, tapping their pencils in the table interrupted a tense silence.
They all peered at me and I wish I was somewhere far away.
I constantly repeated in the spirit of "Communists-Communists-supermen, supermen." What I got?
Why I'd rather stayed with the Smiths?
Fix turnouts I could without any fucking review.
But now?
Career officer took his overhead before it began.
Return to the platoon?
It probably won't work on me, the Chief of the hour.
"Comrade, how have you checked here of Comrade?" interrupted the silence the Chief issue on the Act.
Well, according to the report from the previous job.
Do you have here?
Kádrovákovi obviously not twice.
Beads of sweat on the forehead, nervously blinking, as if they had been audited.
Eagerly nodded and gave the Chief a piece of paper.
"Oh," said the Chief, with a žoviálnosti, which, however, often used to be the harbinger of a lightning storm.
At first glance the same praise, with distinction, graduated from the school, he worked in piecework wage as a locksmith, standard in the average of the one hundred and twenty percent.
But it's essential.
Where did you get this testimonial, Comrade? "he turned again to a cadre, who felt that it kind of begins to turn against him, and that very soon, perhaps not even have to be kádrovákem.
Here comrade I gave it, when boarding.
This will give you enough?
"Well, when he went to the precinct to the platoon," said the personnel manager.
And there are testimonials do not require, that his was the kind of extra, so I gave it to a folder.
"So when the inclusion into the technical features of this piece of paper," the Chief said dryly.
Personnel manager, nervously blinking and had to answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss it later," said the Chief of the kádrovákovi affair and relieved.
So far it has.
"So what you, Comrade?" said Chief again to me.
Suddenly my calls, so this is the end!
In his eyes I was bewildered, polilo me hot.
It was followed by a barrage of blame and accusations, and I knew, that I most creatures in the world that does not deserve mercy.
That podstrčením the incomplete report I stated in the mistake of Comrade kádrového officer, while I did not understand why the opinion of an incomplete when I got it from a cadre in the plant.
I also antisocialistický element, which at the time of the building of socialism supports participating religious obscurantism, ba, even participating in them.
That, that, that was a lot of what I've committed, or maybe even committing and I quietly prayed that it was over.
It was all one to me.
I was the one that kicked out of place mechanizátora.
I didn't care that I take and the Pickaxe.
It's work for an honest and decent people, not an enemy of the people, which I was, in the eyes of Comrade Chief.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," said the President of the party and strongly interrupted their levity.
Here comrade made the mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, done right the crap!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget it, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young person than him at the time we close the door to the party!
It opened again, he will have to prove that they have changed, that it is once again worthy of our trust.
Uneducated guard spoke as the book.
Where did it come from?
Is so learned or phrases from the party before training and meetings?
Therefore also this young comrade must get from us a chance!
The chance to prove that it has changed.
And who has to give it to him, if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to this young, true, somewhat misguided, support in his efforts!
It's your party the obligation that you get rid of!
Actually, it is the duty of all of us a party.
Here comrade must see that side of him I didn't forget.
As a kind mother not only punishes, but that also loves.
When the President finished, no sound.
No one expected such a reversal of the situation.
At least I do.
"Absolutely I agree with you, Comrade President," ice said the Chief in an attempt to once again take the initiative.
If you let me finish, so you heard that exactly such a conclusion I was heading.
They all nodded, but it was up to them to see that he does not believe a word of it.
"So I was confirmed for the separate officer taking care of basic resources," said I to return to the Office and then I cried.
Yet in addition to inženýrky Eve they were out to lunch.
She silently listened to my incoherent version fresh experiences and I had calmed down.
When I finished, she asked whether I'll have coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, put water on the stove and was hers.
In the meantime, she explained about the kádrováckých practices.
As a testimonial, often full of praise, the man in the arm, and the second, in which all the dirt, they will send a new employer.
But I finished where I had, but on the štrece with a Pickaxe, and the comrades of the factory did not know where to send it.
And our personnel manager?
This is just the old, where he ate or drank, and it eventually turned out, how it turned out.
"He's from the old," she said wickedly.
Today, he definitely will not like it.
Just watch out for him, it is quite vindictive.
And Party Chairman?
In essence, far worse, the Chief of any philanthropist.
Zero from the picks with great power.
The water started to boil a cup of coffee and then an Office filled with the scent of coffee just drenched.
I dropped into Cup lump of sugar and mixed hot concoction.
Perhaps I'm the worst.
Now, though, and the next review is up to three years.
Anyway, the Chief of the comrade today just so he won't forget.

The symbol of the village come alive.
The vane wheel of Chlumem is spinning again after many years.

For the village is 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the municipal character, which the municipality has received on the occasion of the meeting of natives in 2010.
"We have applied for a character and a fan, of course, we would like to have on the character, knows him around everyone," said Mayor Jiri Masek.
Chlumské wind pump is the local technical monument.
It is also a little memento today: recalls the time when in fact the people fought on the quality of drinking water.
The one in Chlum in past centuries was a rarity.
In the year 1910 decided to chlumští representatives for the solution, which then suit up until the mid-1980s.
In the village at the turn-off to the left down seven metres Číchov deep well.
Three years later, well they metal structures with a wind pump that water to be drawn into the reservoir in the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The company has carried out Construction of the border Anton Kunc Moravia cargo 2 400 crowns," says a Memorial inscription on the ground the enclosure structure of the mast.
The pump after a few repairs and falls wind wheels had worn out in 1971.
On 7 December 2004. in May 1973, then began to write a new chapter in the struggle for water: this day in Chlum began to serve a new water supply system.
Wind pump have remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and its rarity.
The dominant feature of this year's work in meeting the natives.
In the year 2008, the Chlumští decided to wind the wheel again and bring into operation again.
Left to make a replica of the original round-a slightly smaller on average about half a meter.
The bike was fitted with a mast, in the same year, however, had to be laid down.
Manufacturer of replica mean choose suitable material and the bike could not resist the meltemi wind.
Then k dominant several years resting in pieces under the roof.
Since June, however, the round on a high mast again.
On the occasion of the meeting of natives village left a replica wheels to adjust and it occupied the top of the iron Tower.
But the round draws drinking water from the well only to spill the blank shoulder.
And over the summer he completely disconnected, because the well was a little water.
Spun at least.
"The autumn wind round the shaft of the pump in suction basket, we again," explained Mayor M.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic, where the wind was in the municipal character, however, is the only town of its kind on the entire Highlands.
A similar element in a character have to honor the local technical monuments, for example, in the Chvalkovicích and green mountain to Vyškovsku, in the Kuzelov on the Partutovicích on the Rockies Hodonín, or Shelf in the Vsetín district.
No offense, but I don't know the Lafatu, admitted the standby Tripoli Goian.
"The match against Slavia I remember very well, and my goal, as in all my career," said 34letý Goian to straight pre-match press conference.
Georghe Hagi coached us back then, it was too bad that we lost.
I hope I'll score a goal even now.
With the only difference being that this time of game, "said Goian.
This man, who has played 60 matches for the Romanian national team, and is a key underpinning of the Greek team.
As the shortstop will be the Spartans ' offensive raids.
It comes a couple of thousand people, no hell, says Greek Spartan Hybš a duel.
And partly, it can wait for Thursday night.
Well known Fataie, which played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Luciano.
In that time I have seen all of their matches.
I know that it is a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta, Goian said.
Other players, the Club was, and so came the direct question of whether he knows and David Lafatu, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled, and with a slightly pointed an accusatory gaze on Czech journalists.
Clueless expression on his face broke: "why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot as a team.
He has really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anybody else except Fataie.
It's the Spartans on the Goianovi knows very well.
"He has experience from larger clubs, one can say that holding the defense of Asterasu, is an organizer of the games," observed the Sparta Assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian already has the best years behind him, but it boasts a very interesting football biography.
His time of him interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City units, from Steauy but headed to Palermo, also played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We are waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a great team, regularly plays the European cups, fighting for victory in the Czech League.
For me it is the favorite in this match, but we play at home and we want to start off a good group result.
As well as Sparta we will try to win, said Goian.
I'm in the room with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomas Kosice, which opponents from the Czech Republic enjoyed a lot.
I too.
But for the entire team, I can say that we will fight hard.
Kofola moves from Poland to the Czech Republic, the Prague stock exchange is considering the entry.
The new seat should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland because of the trading in shares of the company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps that we have taken in the framework of the project, are mostly legal and administrative and have no actual impact on events in society, says Daniel Buryš, financial Director of Kofola.
"In connection with the transfer of the headquarters of a group of shareholders are considering the placement of shares on the Prague stock exchange."
Due to the entry on the Prague stock exchange, the company is completing the listing particulars, which presents in the nearest time, the Czech National Bank for approval.
The move of the seat of the holding and the related transfers of shares will be effected by means of private transactions with the expectation that it will participate in the only existing shareholders.
Under this operation, therefore, no shares will be offered to public subscription or new investors.
"Any offer shares to new investors would be held-if the company and its shareholders decide later, either in the 4. quarter 2015 or 1. 2016.0 quarter, "the company said.
The company already said in the past that any offer shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This menu might consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and in Poland, including the location of the stocks on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
The test of objectivity of Czech television in informing about the migrantské crisis.
Another little test of objectivity and balance of the news coverage of the main Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time the main news broadcast on Czech television.
And how did?
To be on the Faculty of the journalism teaching about how the media can manipulate reality, they can let go of today's Czech television broadcast of the event.
Migrantské crisis was about 80% of broadcast news.
Up to the first minute, when informed of the disturbances on THU Serbia-Hungarian border and attacks on police officers called euphemistically migrants reached them patience-threw rocks and attacked with metal bars), I rode the current promigrantská propaganda-judge for yourself the names of individual reports.
Criticism of the non-governmental organisations-large space for nonprofit organizations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech school-the story of the integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but as a chance.
The wandering refugees-THU consistently uses the terms refugee or runaway and not migrant.
Striking is that in the illustration uses THU shots consistently and only shots on small children and women.
While in the same posting stated that of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic is 80% of men.
Summary: for the most part propaganda, which is unprecedented since the Communist agitek.
I have to say that as a former journalist for the colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I used to be now on panelákový flat, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
The umakartový toilet I figured silverfish.
Homemade silverfish insects with incomplete metamorphosis, i.e., neprodělávající that the transformation from Caterpillar to the beetle and the chick looks like an adult individual, only is teeny and gradually grow.
I was disgusting and I destroyed manuscript is.
First manually and then chemically.
Socialist drugs at their disposal to provide the sort of blue crystals.
I think it's called Zyklon B.
Or something else?
It is, however, successfully wipe out.
Later, I solved it with the Pharaohs like.
Box with a kind of juvenalizátorem, who brought to the nest of ants, and he then did not allow the Queen to generate a new offspring.
But I got sidetracked.
As time went on, it became a subject of my admiration, even insects and more and more I began to think that they have the same right to life as we the people.
In addition, I took from life's experience, that the interference with the ecosystem does not lead to success and a pest can replace the other.
True for fleas and bugs I felt free to aggravate their karma's killing.
In the new residence with partner agreed that if the us would not scrambling for silverfish neck, whether you're eating crisps renegade skin, some invisible lashes and the like.
Their quiet existence disrupted after a time the spider.
It was common type of pokoutníka, who dwelt on the ceiling.
We had considered that the lives of the occasional flies and mosquitoes, which are only increasing the comfort.
Because with us he lived for several years, we have found that mainly feed on rybenkami and that their number apparently kept on únosném strength.
Confidential regular contact at each carried out the need, we find that it is a female.
We were seeing a romantic courtship with a partner about a third less, how careful strumming on the threads of the cobwebs, not eaten before it reaches the coveted copulation.
It took about three days ago, when they did not and neither on our checks.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love Games took place, we found the remains of a later addition to the females by male.
Then the spider long weeks did not stir.
When we think it has surprised us, a number of small pavoučků hanging at various points in its surroundings.
Soon disappeared.
The work they were eaten, the work of scattered elsewhere.
Even the female after a week disappeared somewhere.
If she's gone away or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, again appeared on the ceiling.
True, a little less, probably the daughter of that praobyvatelky the toilet.
From the ceiling some time carefully watching our behavior and movement under the toilet bowl, evaluated our non-aggression as a friendship.
The numerical status of the somewhat namnožených silverfish again decreased and the spider's looked his normal activities to ensure the food.
All year with our ecosystem.
Our daughter in between in the age when the use of the nočníku it was a disgrace.
Yet we are tolerated, but eternal emptying its contents are which.
We still more strongly urged her to use the toilet.
The daughter, however, for keeping your habit found an excuse in that spider, which when wiping, very well seen.
Our speech about that Spider see happiness in the House have not been at all.
Crying and holding your potty's roar.
It was not necessary.
There was a moment when he had to the spider, in the interest of the development of offset daughter.
It left on me.
He has been captured in a jar and banned over the balcony into the garden.
I parted with him as with a friend, but I felt after such a long coexistence of ugly, as if tossing a relative.
We expected that the silverfish start to appear more often and start to multiply exponentially.
Wonder of wonders, a week, two, are there no.
I started to speculate about the cause.
I was wondering if there is a spider that's along the lines of the ants somehow nepěstoval, that the environment is not favourable for the toilet of their existence, as we thought.
But then there were the first pieces of medium size, and swarmed again.
I had to figure out a different theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I came to it, that their binding to the spider must have had cause in the fact that when it sees that it is tucked away on some other place and that danger to them from anywhere.
Or, maybe you have a telepathic connection with its predator and its rapid disappearance of them a poplašnou reaction.
The more that's about their eyesight don't do no illusions.
Some light shyness exhibited, but that it would respond to the waving of the hands or fast movements, no.
The daughter had to use the bathroom walks regularly.
I think I forgot to potty.
It remains only to attract back some of the spider.
Now I am sending your wishes on the air, and I hope that on me after the execution nezanevřeli.
Otherwise we would have to use the Cyclone B.
The ten commandments of statements of Albert Einstein, which enrich the world.
Statements by the ingenious scientist of the last century, mankind probably never stop to fascinate.
He is into everything to dive so deep that it has always been a figment of stunning findings.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
Into the consciousness of the people came for his special and general theory of relativity, which best describes the universe in its gigantic proportions.
You also cannot forget his clarification fotoefektu or the idea of quantization of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the very deskripce and system knowledge, the popular theory of relativity is, for many, so intricate that acquaintance I'd rather elect easy analogies.
But it is not simple.
Of course, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein, even if on this brilliantly simplified form of explanation found: near the Hour of your beloved, it seems making; the timer in a hot oven, it seems-and it's relativity.
I took the liberty of his whole Pleiades of famous quotes to select these ten, which literally grabbing me.
Smart people trying to solve problems, genius, is trying to do.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
For the first, I'm not so sure.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove that I was right.
Only one, however, at any time can prove that I was wrong.
But it is a sad period, when it is easier to break the atom than to destroy the preconceptions.
If the mess on the table reflect the disarray in the mind, then what reflects an empty desk?
I don't know what will be fought in the third world war, but in the fourth, it will be with sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no how to resurrect.
Know little is dangerous and know a lot also.
If I had an hour to cope with the problem, which would depend on my life, I spent 40 minutes of his 15 minutes of its analysis and its solution for 5 minutes.
The hardest thing in the world to understand the income tax.
In conclusion, I cannot forgive the Einstein's formula to put it on the definition of success: If we take and considered a success, the formula: A = X + Y + Z, where X is work, Y and Z is the rest to hold the tongue.
The new and modern.
The hospital in Zlín region are waiting for changes in 1.5 billion.
"It is a success, considering that the whole of this year, all four sticks in the black," said Governor Stanislav Hubert happily.
The total profit of the regional facilities is at this moment, about 32 million crowns.
Market share mainly higher reimbursement from insurance companies, which are just as favourable for this year.
This fact shows that after years of the hospital's poor finally can afford a bigger investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín was brewing for the buildings, which together will become almost 1.5 billion.
Long term, when we purchased the unit, mainly over.
Now we have to start to build a new building, because without them, the top health care do not justify the plans regional Deputy for health, Lubomír.
On the changes in all the hospitals.
The builders come to hospitals next year.
In Vsetín now selected the vendor of a new internal Pavilion for nearly 300 million Czech Crowns.
In Kroměříž to the scheduled extension of dialysis.
Uherské Hradiště wants to open a central Pavilion this year had a new medicine for the roughly 200 million.
And the Baťa Zlín hospital waiting long-delayed construction of the new Central intake and internal medicine, you will need three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, it is a crucial and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors is an extremely important step," she said, for example, for the construction of «internal medicine hospital director Vera Prousková.
A five story building there to be ready in about two years and offers comfortable amenities for the internal medicine and Neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, and intensive care unit beds.
Greater comfort for the patients.
The changes, which greatly recognize especially the patients, touching all of the regions.
The new building had replaced those in which it is located, for example, many of the patients in one room, on the floor have to be only one bathroom, beds are nepolohovatelné, window leaks, and health professionals have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our internal medicine was built 35 years ago and now is on the border of your life," the Director of the hospital in Zlín, pointed out Paul Calábek.
In a few years it will replace seven-storey modern building connected with urgent.
Doctors and patients will be in one place all the acute Division, moreover, in the new areas.
The same model has already finished half of Uherské Hradiště.
The Central income already standing and within three years there will be internal to it.
"The construction will pay on the loan and partly from its own resources," said Director Peter Brewer.
The hospital's own financing can as the only one in the region.
Still has the highest profit and losses get even two years ago, when the hospital should be dealt with almost Zlin dvousetmilionovou loss.
"We have a good contract with insurance companies, excellent performance, raise revenue and effectively we manage costs in the entire hospital," Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Improvements are also patients Kroměříž hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years, will go to the repairs, new equipment and reconstruction of up to half a billion crowns.
This year will be ready repair places, then the extension will start dialysis, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance imaging.

No one has explained to me how I should received refugees in the country, when they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Inmate (CSSD) after negotiations with its European colleagues complain that other States are pushing for the adoption of Czech quotas on the reallocation of refugees, but any discussion.
Notes also that no one has ever explained to him, as it should be allocated to the refugees in the Czech Republic, when they don't want to live with us as well.
"The answer we got, and therefore, we wanted to make the quotas have been omitted from the final text," the inmate said to reporters.
You can specifically describe the position that you have come to the meeting of the Ministers of the Interior and of Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as with a system that simply cannot work.
We can't talk about migrants as of bagged salt or flour.
They are living creatures that have some vision, pointing out, have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues, how are we able to migrants on the territory of the Member States, should the redistribuovali.
We can't imagine.
The answer we got, and therefore, we wanted to make the quotas have been omitted from the final text.
With other findings-functional hotspots, i.e., the place of registration, protection of borders, camps outside Europe, the Trust Fund for the African country and other things, we have no problem.
We're talking about it for a year and we say that this is the way to go.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Recently, we address the forty thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how those people on that territory we keep?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through the us, wants to Germany.
To almost no one wants us, we simply do not know how it is here.
We have the ambition to go to other foreigners, the Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others, who take the Czech Republic as the destination country, gaining us asylum, but the interest of the people of this migration wave from Syria and other countries, is asymptotically close to zero.
You've alluded to, that the refugees do not want to us, actually, but fifteen hundred people we are committed to adopt.
It would not be possible to accept them more this way?
We are committed to take 1500 people, but with the condition.
We said: functional hotspots, the protection of the borders, a military operation.
Even for those it's about 1500 come 1100 people, with which we handle asylum procedure.
Come to our its detention facilities and we will treat them as well as to those that we picked up.
It is a great question, and we'll be debating Europe, if we can hold people who are registered in Italy and Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe is the acts so that they have to register, they cannot be detained.
That is, they come to our territory with the registration, and if the agreement is not yet, that neither of those 1100 track on the territory of the Czech Republic, and they do it again after the arrival of Germany leave.
If we can hold for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will deal with them, the asylum procedure.
It will be the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, from almost 98 percent, according to European statistics obtained international protection.
Then they get the documents that would allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think that these people again end up in the target countries.
Then there is the four hundred people, who will be přesídlovat.
This is the second project that has not yet begun, and there we progressed only in the fact that we with churches about the possibility that they could help to get a job, accommodation and so on.
But it is running on a very long haul.
You said that at the meeting of Ministers with us other States were not willing to discuss.
But this is not so, that only the Czech Republic rejects a quota, but does not offer any solidarity step that would unblock discussion?
And what exactly has to be solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany makes an incentive that all migrants from Syria can to them, so that the message is spread in hours after all the camps of Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages further migration wave, which is heading to Germany, because we just don't want to.
We think that the journey is the protection of external borders-just those waves of migration, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
They clearly demonstrate that they have no chance.
Just last year to Germany came to fifty thousand Kosovars.
Of a safe and secure Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this State, including the police, the courts, the public prosecutor's Office.
If we could separate them, and do not accept or accept only in accordance with the needs of economies, so would those fifty percent from what on them today, social systems in vain issue, could go for the refugees.
Compared to the first day, when Germany established a control, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic.
Now it is eighty, the first day it was twelve.
It has happen to still have tightened border controls?
We were afraid of detection in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers that we have.
We have still a few hundred free places in detention centres are treated stone installations.
Of course, all the people that we hold, we will within seven days of returning to Austria.
We do this by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who are those people take, with Hungary's complex and the Greeks-this is completely unnecessary story.
Where is the tipping point?
It would have to be a thousand times a day?
I think that it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three consecutive days are run out of capacity, enough contingency plans.
Then, I agreed with Mr. Prime Minister, that he would immediately convene an emergency Government.
He is about the whole thing, we are very interested in phone contact several times a day.
If this situation occurred, the Government can celebrate the de facto immediately and one resolution would be decided on the strengthening of the army, the police say, the customs administration of the prison service.
The extreme variation of a State of emergency, which is now in some places, declared Hungary?
I think that it can't be this far.
Please be aware that our position is different, we are the national State within Europe, the Schengen border, we have the only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen for it to make this happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread the alarm information.
All the information that we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggest rather that the Hungarians will try to divert the flow of migration to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct path to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost not at all.
Slavia paid off at the last moment a large portion of the debt.
Trying to prevent bankruptcy.
The Slavia football paid the debts.
Their money they also footballers.
Football on Tuesday for the first time Slavia stood because of insolvency proceedings before the Court.
Nearly three months after her because of the roughly 20 million crowns filed company Online Services from Pacific Samoa.
The legal representative of the Slavie Zuzana Mládková tried to judge Michael Wenzlovou in a few hours to make sure that it does not have over Slavia to declare bankruptcy.
And it must be said, from the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that before last week, the new owner of the Slavie became large Chinese industrial and investment group, also CEFC and Czech billionaire George Šimáně.
Obviously, from the new owners of the Club, and that the money arrived at the last minute.
It proves even before Tuesday's judicial representation of the Slavie negotiations-vršovický Club in Monday, just a day before the hearing in the Court, sent due to tens of millions of Crowns.
"Everything was between 11. September and 15. September was paid, "said the legal representative of the Slavie Mládková.
Who paid the Slavia?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, Slovak or Czech Milan, Ivan exreprezentantovi záložníkovi Maria Ličkovi.
Slavia also pay the fee to the agent Alexander Losenickemu.
Already on Friday, the Club also paid fees owed the city district of Prague 10.
Part of the insolvency of the dispute remain de facto only claims that Uefa opposes.
Either by the obligations incurred at the Club, or lead legal disputes.
However, we are ready in the event of loss of the amount paid.
"We have the necessary funds in a bank account, which we can substantiate the statement of account," said judge advocate Mládková.
"All that was past due, is paid," she said, adding that Mládek outstanding are the only trade or of the claim liabilities.
Sure, that in the next few days, the judge decides and the proceedings will continue.
Slavia gave three weeks that sent the detailed evidence that actually paid these debts.
Subsequently, the evaluation of all the evidence.
The decision can be expected in November, as soon as possible.
The judge ordered the continuation of negotiations on the third of November.
The decision, however, will not fall even at this meeting, but to him in writing.

The blank was going to build so that it foundered.
But the cost would be about half a billion more, said an expert from the company, projected that the tunnel.
Blanka went to Mint even safer, says an expert.
Blanka tunnel complex, it was possible to build so that there have been two busts of soil in the Prague park Stromovka, says production manager company Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovič.
Said this on Wednesday evening when a journalistic tour of the tunnel.
It would be but according to him, about a half billion more expensive.
Drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a trade-off between cost and safety.
"The tunnel was minted safer, but the costs grow exponentially," said Butovič.
Conditions in the Area were, according to him, all the time the same, yet the country has plummeted in just a few steps from the place where he began minting a safer and more prudent method.
"If the measures used about 500 metres before the tunnel would have been about half a billion more expensive," said Butovič.
During the construction of the Blanka tunnel failed three times.
Twice in 2008, was a crater in the Area, in 2010, the land fell to the Ministry of culture in Prague 6.
According to the Director of the company Metrostav Jiří Bělohlava is a tunnel unnecessarily expensive, said the weekly Euro.
The construction should be in accordance with the original intent of the State to 17 billion.
When we add sales tax for the period the building twice, from 17 billion popped up you have twenty-one.
When the added technology, buying land and engineering activities, indexation and similar items, it's 29 billion, which is no longer from the back up to 37 so far, said Bělohlav
It's someone ordered and paid it.

At its meeting the band in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend this week two days seated at 27 feet long of Honduran mahogany table and will decide whether after almost ten years, it is time to raise the key interest rate.
Towering over them at one end of the ornament of the Central Bank, the two-storey meeting room will be a mural of the United States.
A map is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet l. Yellen and her colleagues have put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has a double charge of Congress: maximize u.s. employment and keep the prices stable.
But since the great recession, fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-factor in too close to the foreseeable decision, to be announced Thursday about whether the u.s. economy is ready to run the shut-down of the unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rate in place since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows a solid growth of the economy, the recent turbulence on world financial markets could already cautious Fed scare due to adding to volatility by raising its benchmark federal funds rate-even for nothing more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labor market and inflation will be in the first place, the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey Piegza, m., Chief Economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & What.
"But I think that just looking for an excuse to raise rates, increased the uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides sufficient justification for them to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of the nervousness on the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently polled by Blomberg, anticipated the increase in rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed will delay the matter, with the key indicator of only about 30% of chances to increase.
It would have pointed to the decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates, the only politicians to soften the fall in the promise of the next increase is in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16, 599.85.
The Assembly has started the expectations that Fed policymakers will delay rates this week in a calm, says John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates now," he says.
If it did, the politicians, the Fed "would have to go to great lengths in his keynote and hold hands the financial markets to forfeited panic."
Other experts argued that the rate increase would have calmed the financial markets, because it would remove the uncertainty of how the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, it appeared that the Fed is on track to increase rates by 0.25 of a percentage point this month, the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions, which would confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the United States.
Yellen said that through the spring and early summer is expected to increase rates this year despite complaints from Liberals, there is a need for more economic progress.
Even though job creation slowed in August, the labour market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of lifting.
And even though inflation continues to be under an annual 2% goal of the Central Bank, the Fed policymakers argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs, with respect to the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at the Pantheon Project.
But the financial markets around the world began to struggle late last month, after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones industrial average dropped to about 16% below its record high value in may, as investors worried that a slowing China's economy ran down global growth.
The market rebounded slightly this month and the Dow now is losing almost 10% only from the may highs.
The Fed's policy makers nervous market situation adds a complex calculus, when to start raising interest rates.
"In the absence of what happened in the financial markets, and the reports of weakness in the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen d. Oliner, a leading researcher in the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now predicts it will wait at least a month, to gain better control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what impact it will have on the u.s. economy, and have almost no information on which they could rely on the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The State of health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the fed, so technically it should not be included in their decision making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the Monetary Authority around the world.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
Just a hint of the then Chairman Ben s. Bernanke in 2013, the Fed could "bite" their monetary expansion on the market, triggered the spasms all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are still closely linked, you can expect that fed officials are watching the development elsewhere, but also to advise with other central bankers and experts so that they can better read the State of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, VA., said this month that "the Fed has a history with exaggerated movements on the financial markets, which seem incoherent with the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policy making Federal open market Committee, which pushed the rate increase, citing the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings "despite limited identifiable impact on growth in the u.s.," said Lacker.
A year later, fed officials turned to these cuts.
The Fed should prioritize the concerns about financial stability only during the great depression, as was the market collapse of 2008, said Adam Posen, a former member of the Committee that determines the rate of the Bank of England.
The latest uproar is even close to this level, he said.
"I definitely want to be in a situation of fear from the growth rates, because markets had ever made," said Posen, President of the Institute for international economics Peterson.
The law on the Federal Reserve system has a dual mandate and makes no mention of financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think that they should get on the cutting edge.

Hungarian police officers allegedly embarked on the refugee status of the dog.
Then they forced journalists to delete the record.
Hungarian police on the border with Serbia briefly detained a cameraman AP and forced him to delete the record on which the police dog reportedly knocked to the ground.
The Hungarian Government but denies this charge.
The alleged incident occurred Saturday night, when the AP Men filmed by cinematographer Luca migrants who through a corn field near the Hungarian town of Röszke crossed the border with Serbia.
Against the refugees, intervene, police and one of them had left on a Syrian attack dog with basket on the nose.
The dog of a man who was shouting "Please, please, I am a fugitive," wrestled, claims the Men.
The fact that Men all films, noticed one of the police officers and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist then he could not even make a phone call to his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The police Muziho the dark spot at the registration centre for refugees and asked him to show them what he has recorded.
Then he ordered that the record is deleted.

Unpredictable League champions.
Win City, off the us believes Juventus
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," the head of Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of domestic City.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic match of the Champions League.
Neither team produced much opportunities, but the ball on kopačkách, we had more we.
"The cause of defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals," said match Pellegrini, whose team cashed in a competitive match after long 636 minutes.
It's a finalist last season, Juventus was before this meeting exactly the opposite-after the first three rounds of the Italian League has as defender of the title just point and with a score of 2:4 is up to 16. place the table.
I was therefore the turnover at Etihad Stadium the big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, off us," coach Massimiliano Allegri believes that before the new year had to deal with the loss of three mainstays-Pirla, Téveze and Vidal.
The title is in Manchester, Mandžukič and Pogba Morata.
"This is so, this victory is very important, perhaps thanks to him we hit on a winning wave," hopes Morata.
Because when we're on it, we rank among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the attack phase.
This result my players deserve.
"Before our compensatory goal we could collect on the contrary, 0:2, but the us held Gianluigi," said coach Allegri goalie Buffona.
"We burned a few good chances," midfielder Yayu, Tourého was upset City.
We have to get out of the Champions League experience and next time try for a better result.
Goodbye Angelo, goodbye to the old Germany II.
Before we continue on the question of immigrants, we should realize that all this media craziness around is controlled by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a moment.
Today the newspapers and the media are full of babies, that bear on the hands of their parents along the dirt roads of the exodus.
And it raises in man-i.e. the European man-automatically guilt and compassion.
Well, they just don't come here desperate kids, note the shots landing boats to the Greek Islands, that babies so much to see!
Well, somehow we recently disappeared from television pictures of ships headed to the Lampedusu, refugees from the French border at Menton, on the beautiful promenade-clad jetsetters lounge thousands of young men.
For the most part young blacks.
And also disappeared the images of where these swarthy Callais and black men waiting, if they manage to crawl through the tunnel under the English channel.
About it if.
Even the images of primitive Christian Church Eritrejců somehow to make the people of Europe a special impression.
Too much of it sticking out of the falsity.
So when it comes to the quota for refugees, somehow concealing, that it's not just about the unfortunate children of Syria, but also about the vystajlované-for the older: hip vyfešákované-young men.
The muskulatury look like they just climbed out of a fitness centre.
Just a personal experience.
This summer, on the Turkish-Muslim-part of Cyprus we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
Regardless, it was a private, came to the beach at the same time, a large group of cars.
But no ham.
And one of them spoke to young blacks.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years ago.
They went to the beach, all the clothes in the branded garments and shoes. In the hands, of course, smartphones.
That it is a private beach, is the care and staff-Turks, Muslims! -they are obviously worried.
Took all the chairs.
Who wasn't on it and was in the sea, had bad luck.
They were both dressed in the American rapperského film.
On their caps with a fingernail, white and colored trainers on my feet.
Then besieged the local bar and began to feast.
Occupied tables around, piled next to the seated guests snědým and white bar-read Muslims and Europeans without being asked.
Mothers with children, fleeing from the dining terrace to relax.
Incoming movements and drank beer straight from the třetinek-how in the series from the USA?! -on the beach throwing empty bottles around.
Constantly loud bellowing at one another.
However, it was not in English.
Then he gave up drinking wine straight from the bottle, too.
Piling into the hotel swimming pool-in designer swimsuits, especially those young ladies, in the water screaming and bellowing, mothers with children and pensioners in horror and ran for half an hour I was on the beach or in the swimming pool or a nečerný host.
They all disappeared.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a muslim.
The staff is worried about them and just talk.
The waiter told me the evening quietly said: "did you see that what they wore?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, it's certainly not from work," said the waiter.
I thought: "I know they all had a massive gold chains around the necks.
And one had on her neck about twenty-centimetre massive cross of gold.
And the women were as jewellery.
"They are drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You saw how they drink," replied the waiter.
Drugs nepašují, or themselves.
You bring something completely different.
So it was clear to me what the smuggled.
However, in June the 2105 it still was not so important for me.
I didn't know what will follow.
But the secret service and top politicians should know first.
It does seem to me that they didn't know.
In Europe at that time published by about 1.5 million immigrants.
And go and go and go.
Today, it turned out that the main problem of the European Union is that it's totalitarian-political-correct politicians, like intellectuals and established lobbying and economically important groups have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians-today publicly acknowledged a major force in Europe-they lie, lie and lie-but not only they, also, the tip of the EU and of television, including ours.
For example, a recent television images of the enthusiastic welcoming of refugees in Germany are at the level of the Moscow television images of August 1968.
Certainly, the station was a few sluníčkářů, but mainly-staroněmečtí-Muslims greeted their fellow-tribesmen.
The long weeks of blábolili in the reports on the Czech television, as they say they are, according to a research by the Germans, almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
But who was only a few days in Germany, knows that it is a lie.
Which confirm the for more information.
For example, the famous opinion poll organized by the ARD-English Association of public television by the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD still wanted to claim a week ago, more than 50% of the Germans to accept more refugees.
It also meldovaly our tv.
However, they have withheld, what other day snapped in Germany: that in the anketním vote to the article turned out, that the Germans had no 94.5% of immigrants does not want-the poll was attended by 67 000 persons.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, that is, five years ago, said: "our efforts to ́multi-kulti ́společnost totally failed."
Then she said: "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All the efforts of such coexistence of totally failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, it didn't work a strategy that people from different cultural environment allow live next to each other, without integrated. Today they live here with us and we took some time to nalhávali that remain, that one day disappear.
But this is not the reality.
A multicultural approach, when we say that's just we live happily next to each other, so this approach has failed.
Totally failed.
But Merkel has probably not power to go against powerful Germany and Europe and mainly against political correctness.
It shows the escalation event.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euroněmec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, Member of Parliament for the SPD, only that in the European Parliament does not have a high school diploma of the supposedly-Yes, this is the one of which Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said they would play the minutes in the concentration camp overseer, as demonstrated again.
It seems, especially under the impression over recent statements by German politicians that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that some European politicians, most of these statements does not support, the statesmen of the countries which were the victims of Nazism, they are appalled.
What is it with the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who for years has tried, at least outwardly, deal with his terrible past, the aggressor and the murderer of millions?
You are right in what they say, that the soul of Germany's aggression, the superiority of the devil zaset and violence?
He was right, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, when all his force stopped attempts to gain control of the entire Velkoněmců the middle of Europe?
When he said that Germany would destroy the idea of a velkoněmecká?
Probably should.
If it had started preparing for the 1. the World War II.
The idea of the Velkoněmecka, which brought Germans and Europe into two wars, which cost millions of lives, are likely to be in a different form.
After attempting to take over the State, such as Marxists with Rote Fraktion Faction, and after the failure of the GDR, in Germany, for example, on the basis of ecology, which by the way was one of the major philosophical doctrines of Nazism, started to develop the new German ideology.
We sluníčková.
The German elites had long prevented the formation of German nationalism, and so leaving room all you fighters against the atom enthusiasts looking for a paradise for all, quietly support the old imperial and Nazi password Our les must live.
To satisfy restless young people everywhere in the world they want to do something different, and better, fully endorsed the party of fighters against the heating of the planet, nuclear power, etc.
And forgot about that in this stream there are also strongly anti-Semitic or propalestinský-and the antislovanský stream making all Slavs difficult it's scum-since the time of Karl Marx, who, after their parents were Jewish, a German nationalist.
And also how to show the most recent statements by Schulz and German have openly vyhrožujících recalcitrant Eastern States, the idea of vůdcovského of Germany.
That it is necessary to obey without protest to listen to.
Otherwise, Woe unto you!
And when it, blend it, that immigrants are of manageable group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind it as always, especially the German capital, which suits and tyje that Germany actually through the Bank and Union controls most of the States of Europe.
Pseudovíra sluníčkářů first introduced the Germans into the swamps and multiklturalismu ekologismu and brought them home tonight and maybe even bring millions of Muslims.
Who, seduced by the voices of sirens, crashes early on the wall of reality, which Merkel wants to see and begin to rebel.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbors with force, once again, can a portion of its inhabitants-but as it seems, still less a part-poblouznit, but ideologically eventually reality will catch up as always.
Germany will burn again?
Muslim hostels now.
What does the German Government, to break out the public protests of the Germans against the incoming Islamists?
Which will come to the aid of Muslims already living in Germany for a long time, but certainly not assimilated to took over the local customs and laws?
What does the German Government, to let each other naturalized Muslims, the incoming islamisti and the Germans, tracking fear Islamization of their country?
What it will do with the Germans, and even with Germany, to get people who will loudly and publicly protest against the new euro-nadčlověku Muslim?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict, which has caused in Europe by supporting the sluníčkářské ideology, the ideology of the elitist and therefore, in principle, totalitarian, and their greedy banks is growing.
And because of the neomalenému negotiations against the recalcitrant democratic Germans and all secondary and recalcitrant Eastern neighbors that cannot turn out well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of vlezlých dealers: scare them to death.
Just knock on the door knocker and a robust Tonio insolently tells you in a way that the weaker nature need not just to stand.
Living head you will wipe away and banish even the thick-skinned, on the way out to accompany (or rather removes) being driven mad by the dealer and the living statue.

The Brazilian Pediatrics society Rio Grande promotes healthy diet while breastfeeding
Brazilian society of paediatric SPRS came with the shocking way to try to convey the knowledge about the importance of good women to diet while breastfeeding, using images of children sajících of breast vymalovaného displaying unhealthy meals.
Human breast milk is composed of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that supply infants all the nutrients that they need to create a strong imunního system.
Thanks to the excess energy requirements is pregnant women and mothers may increase the recommended daily caloric intake by 500 calories a day.
But the new polls suggest that increased intake of calories is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterlandem, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet of pregnant women in fact influenced the genetic creation of their children and protect them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, it is also confirmed that unhealthy diets adversely affecting children's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise is dominated by the rates, although the Nine's attempts to take over the leadership on the Today Show
In the charge of Charles Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra due to cover the cost of the consequences of the leak of a liberal leadership has failed to create sufficient increase in ratings for Today.
The morning show Nine projected from the national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm's not like Turnbull Tony Deal.

In September the average so far is Sunrise 349 000 spectators and 314 000 Today.
This is the most interesting thing for the whole morning.

4 people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of protesters against the proposed new State Constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Chief District Officer, States that more than 1000 protesters gathered in front of the police station and some threw rocks and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal says that police used tear gas, then fired into the air before they resorted to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, says.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last in a week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the ethnic Madhesi groups say they have set up a new province under the proposed new Constitution, and toned down their political influence.
Another demonstration in western Nepal have also been recorded by the ethnic group, which requires the creation of Tharus of their own State.
10. August was when violent clashes killed at least 40 people, including 11 police officers.
When the four main political parties signed an agreement on the Division of the country into provinces — a big step toward a new Constitution, but the very question at issue in Nepal, which was centrally controlled by the centuries.
Work on a new Constitution last since 2008, but lawmakers speed up the process after a devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers this week in Kathmandu, vote on the provisions of the draft Constitution, and officials stated that the new Charter should be taken by Sunday.
Certainly we can't panic now.
After losing the Championship on the ice you can't handle not Working home duel with the hockey team Sparta (3:5).
You do not have the concerns of the similarly disastrous entry into the game as a year ago?
I hope that nothing like this to be repeated.

For moderately obese diabetics could be useful in weight loss surgery
The benefits of weight loss surgery for obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether the slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes after weight-loss surgery live longer than those that are provided by the nechirurgická treatment.
"The data on mortality to the long view," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new JAMA study surgery.
Surgery for weight loss, bariatric surgery to shrink the stomach are used for a variety of methods.
Reducing hunger and limits of the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, Bariatric operations have proved effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of the survey has been carried out on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the relationship of weight relative to height, it is considered normal in denominations between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates overweight people and people with a value of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their study, the researchers used new from Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from the study from 2007, which deals with two types of Bariatric Surgery-gastric bypass surgery and gastrectomy-curative treatments of diabetes type 3 for people who were moderately overweight.
The average BMI between those who have undergone the operation, according to a study of 31 dropped to 24.5 to the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, those who remained were not BMI given surgical treatment of diabetes, roughly equal to the value of 29.
Among patients with diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In medicine the treated group was to compare diabetes resolved completely only by 1 percent and only partially for about 2 percent of patients.
It also was checking blood pressure, trigylceridů, and "bad" LDL cholesterol demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's level of hemoglobin A1c in your blood, which reflects a continuous blood sugar in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7 percent, the researchers reported.
After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the treated group of drugs, however, this value remains at about 8 percent.
But this better "glykemická control"-which is reflected in better levels of hemoglobin A1c did not reduce mortality in five-years, according to the main researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the Group lost more weight with the bypass in comparison with the Group of gastrectomy (18.7 against 14.2 kg), reached a major subsidence BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent against 2.1%) and had a greater likelihood of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent against the 16.7%).
While the new study does not appear to improve survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from studies of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix or.
According to a Swedish study should obese people who underwent bariatrickou surgery, about 29 percent greater chance of survival in the coming 15 years, in comparison with the group, which tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study didn't show improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to the Blackstonea it is a comforting result for people with a BMI under 35, who are interested in these procedures.
"This is critical, because this work is surgery safer in a group with a lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, says.
Blackstone also argues that people and their doctors should start taking the weight really seriously after a decline in the patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we are waiting far too long with the fact that people demonstrate the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think that once the buildup of these genetic changes, which firmly links the their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is already a really heavy.
"It is impossible that they all came to Europe"-Dalai Lama-RT News
Europe is not able to accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the question of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech when opening the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He argued that under the current circumstances, the interest of humanity should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
Also pointed out that the response of Western European countries, whether it was in any way admirable, on the refugee crisis has been inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible that they all came to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in the solution of the crisis, stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"Take care of a few thousand of the refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you have to think about the long term solution to bring true peace and the actual development, in particular through the training of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force will never solve these problems, "he added.
When addressing violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attack and argues that "the violent reaction of the UNITED STATES sparked a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed condolences in a letter to President Bush, and told him that the way to solve this problem has not been a violent path.
I know that his motives were good, but used the power and created the unexpected consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.

"This is a highly concentrated alcohol," said the Fox 4 in Kansas City, Medical Director of the control centre for Toxicology University of Kansas Hospital, Dr. Stephen Thornton.
A glass of whiskey, you just left lying around, but people leave out these sanitation resources and when they get them kids, it's a quick trip to the consumption of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, six-year girl who recently in school she swallowed this to four swallows of the sanity of the reagent with the scent of strawberries and was taken away for treatment at the emergency room.
Her blood alcohol level was. 179, which is twice the threshold considered to be drunk for an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritcheyho, standby doctor who cared about her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah the tongue slurred words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.

"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, the mother of Nhaijah.
It could be fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or arrange to have sanitation resources out of the reach of children.
Outside alcohol poisoning were some sanitation resources associated with death.
In 2013, the two women have died from Ontario after swallowing the sanity of the device, which contained the toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Medics believed that the product contains methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth year, in Northern New York City planned to poison their "evil" of the deployment of antibacterial products around the room, "according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary means and prohibit their presence in the room.
The police examined the frustrated the plan as "innocent chatter," and refer to the discipline of the school district,

Why I witnessed executions in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will follow the killing of a man.
If this happens, and I hope that this does not happen, I will sit in a viewing gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary's death Chamber and see Richard Glossipa, which will be executed by lethal injection.
Asked me to be one of the four officials, who will witness his death.
I received the first invitation in January over his best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day nears, I'm starting to get worried.
Why am I doing it?
I accepted this invitation, because it is a good way for me, as I will be able to denounce the whole story about the death penalty.
Offered me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because it is often more applications than vacancies, the morbid lottery to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever will be chosen, will monitor the entire execution dispassionately.
I can't do it.
I'll sit by the side of the closest friends of Richard Glossipa and I created him a special bond through months of phone calls and one two and a half hour visit.
The guy I like.
Often we laugh when we speak.
The prison administration claims that can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed inside Notepad and won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the's details.
One reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter that kompromituji its impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he pleases to get access.
' I complained to her.
She admitted that "it could articulate better," but he thinks that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things that I said and wrote.
It doesn't tell me what I have to write, and even if it did, I didn't listen to him.
I told him that I may at any time remove from the list of witnesses.
But he wants the international journalists who will be on site, ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the procedures against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, it will be by my side.
If you want to know more information about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts that I've created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't say with certainty that it is Richard Glossip innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would have made him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe that there is a great probability that the murder of the innocent.
Certainly, I believe that it was not provided sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution wrong.
And just from this perspective I will follow his death.
I can't say that I'm really objective.
For this purpose, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me, is the experience of what it is to see the man I love die an unnecessary death.
The man escaped from the Canning River after police pursuit

Peter Moody claims that organisers tried to spy on him and threatens to end races
Peeter Moody accused the organizers of Racing Victoria, that he tried to get into the stable last year as a spy and threatened that immediately ends the race.

"I didn't want to say anything about it that I sat on it for a long time, but they just feel so frustrated that one of you comes out all at once," said Moody.
They know that it was going on.
Sometimes you respond and you must live with the consequences, and I'm going to have to live with what I've said.
Today, I'll go home and sleep well.
I want to walk with your head up and to get the owners to think that I'm doing for them.
When you begin to think the opposite, then it would not be the coach.
I would then consider what will I do with my license.
Previously, Moody released in his interview for the racing.com bomb, that the integrity of the Department attempted to spy on them.
"Eighteen months Ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a guy-which I will post the question create-and they offered him a job in my stables for it, he finds out information about things that are in my stables are carried out," said Moody at Racing.com.
Of course, the thought that I am a cheater.
If this is so, they should all show your information, because in an attempt to catch me utterly failed to do so.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of RVL, David Moodie, the current President of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the current ceo of RVL, it's at that time were aware of and are aware of it even today.
I should think that it becomes a personal matter?
Lets grow a pair of balls's RVL and arrange to people outside the trainer's position took responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
I'm bad for this industry?
I'm really so bad for the industry?
Maybe people think that Yes.
Maybe I need to take my license and push me away and I have no doubt that what I am saying now will give them the material for reflection.
But I got to the point, if it doesn't matter to me, and I'm sad.
It really made me sad.
I will be on them to push and carry the burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go away.
The level of frustration the coach with increased long-term investigations because of cobalt including Lidari and recently aroused in him a feeling of scratching, that "could have their license on the table hours."
Mood, best known for the preparation of the undefeated champion of Black Caviar, has called the treatment rule on race day for the "ridiculous" after the horses feet applied clay poultice or mud, which is against the rules.
It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
Someone from my team accidentally nanesl on his foot to mud.
It might have last night.
It could happen and yesterday it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of tiles in the day of the race, which organizers have opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who create these rules, he knows nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.

Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy strike rivals due to wrestling by claiming
Craig Bellamy, the coach of the Melbourne Storm, he criticized procedures of their players as "setting the plan" two favorites of the NRL premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said that the judge allowed the players to Storm "wrestlovat" of his players during the controversial victory of the team Storm in the final qualifiers in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made slightly veiled comment on Strorm the after his team won the finals qualification over the North Queensland Cowboys Saturday night, when he called the game as "reviews" of rugby league and two from Queensland were "too big" to wrestling.
Bellamy defended the interventions of their players and said that during one concentrated on "contact."
Bellamy said, adding that this situation has increased the confidence, because it is his team criticized two leading coaches, which may mean that they have a fear of defeat from the Storm team.
"It still comes-I don't remember that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling when the us defeated 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in the last year from our defenzivního system and techniques, the last few weeks we've only put emphasis on the contact during the surgeries, and for us it meant turnover.
Trent's here three years and coached by a great team, so probably not used to losing, it could be a bit of a shock.
It is funny how things always come in this part.
Bellamy Bennetovu the idea of "invalidate the exciting football" and reminded his team that mentoru Bennetovův St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 premiership playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about the exciting football.
He was right in that Saturday's game was similarly exciting as ours. Also was just as exciting, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in the year 2010, St George were criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne then said that he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of game, which it seems to appeal, especially its young reservists with their speed.
Such a football would you like to play, if you have this type of players.
He said this view in 2010 and now wants all teams played his style of football-but not every team has two midfielders such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so such a style of play.
Instills in me more self-confidence, because they say such things because they have concerns about the match against us.
Six weeks ago, the us probably eat, when given to the great games.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that in the game Storm and the Roosters fell more goals than in a game the Broncos and Cowboys.
The game of the team the Broncos might have been good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18 in our game were two more attempts, but this is an exciting game of football?
Or are the breaks and neskórování trials find it interesting?
According to me it's the agenda.
If you mention us, it means that I'm sure we'll meet again in the stage.
The storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in a preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.

Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must get behind the injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also pointed out that, for Wilshere is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason to not play again at Christmas.
The best scenario is that he'll miss at least the next sure Wilshere four English games and, from the perspective of history, his involvement in next summer's European Championships, is obviously uncertain.
Too bad this nnejnovějšího problem is that Wilshere finished last season strong after ankle injury and then again to the former form during the předsezóny.
"This type of injury does not endanger the career," said Wenger.
It is a wound that requires treatment.
This is not anything special.
It was just an accident.
It did not involve his ankles or injury, which he suffered before.
This could be from a purely medical point of view true, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of other injuries, whenever any player coming back during the season.
Also here creates an annoying formula.
A survey conducted the Premier Injuries Ltd. recorded 23 different injury Wilshera from the time when six years ago had his game debut.
During the last five years, played in only 65 League matches from the Arsenal of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons from 2007-08 was one of two clubs in the Premier League, which has lost the most days because of the injury.
Wenger accepts the potential vicious cycle, but Arsenal believe that improvements in recorded injury during last season, will continue.
"Sometimes, when you are returning after an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get competition," says Wenger.
Jack is young enough to make out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure that, Yes, and will have the career you deserve.
Arsenal begins campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey never travelled to Croatia, this means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta likely to face off.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudem instead of Nacho Monreala Theo Walcotta.
"I'm trying to maintain the balance and let the players who need a break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite to advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation of the most zastrašujícího Stadium in Europe.
Dinamo also were beaten in a total of 41 matches, after last season's campaign to keep the "matchless".
The stadium is about Wednesday night shook earthquake 3.2 degrees Richter.
It was this year already for the tenth time in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League, when surrendered against Monaco and he remains a distant hope, that will lead the Club to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This deployment is huge," said Wenger.
Arsenal, it never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand I have to be a realist.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show, which gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The absence of a similar view in the variety show is striking, particularly since, as is the need for men to open up even more desperate than ever, as far as the suicide rate among young men in 15 years.
In 2013, it was only the largest cause of death for men aged 20-45 years in the uk and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, identified the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) 2015 as the year of the man whose goal is to challenge a culture that prevents men seek help if needed.
In the heart of this fight is friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with symptoms of depression, found that in the case that the victim had a high enough percentage of friends, "a healthy mood," their chances of recovery are doubled.
As well as for those who are not depressed, mentally healthy circle of friends is a half-chance on the incidence of mental health problems.
But to make a friendship work, must of course be achievable as soon as possible.
In this communication through social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the communication, the immediate answer is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and successful, even when we are in reality rather isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our actual values-our personal desire for growth and friendship-that have a profound effect on our mental health.
And, as recently explained, a billionaire and the creator of the game, the money really doesn't buy more happiness.
The beauty of the series friends was for him a source of this idea.
None of the characters has not been defined by their work, but their personalities, that shone through the friendly interaction.
Joey and Chandler's humor frequent victims, while watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stems from the realization that Yes, men can also identify with, even if you usually let their feelings for each other.
as one worker explained: magicians .... "my role a listener to people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed that even the smallest friendly interaction can make the difference."
Men who contact us, often feel an inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about the problems.
Friends are one of the shows, which me arise in memory, when I try to offer longer-term compensation mechanism.
Stresses small moments in the men's friendship.
As for my task, the underdog status on the phone helps people in moments of zoufalosti, but the long-term aid must come from a larger nearby, from a network of friends and family.
Therefore, if you are going to FrendsFest this weekend organized by Comedy Central station, why not take your friends for a drink in the Central Perku, where the celebrations on the occasion of the Interior completely redone.
Or when you see someone alone at Starbucks, just smile at him and say hello to him.
You never know what a difference your friendship can do.
Friends will be aired on Comedy Central station from beginning to end for 236 episodes-for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo party
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaisem Matuidim and Edinsonem Cavanim after scoring a goal against the Malmu.
Angel Di Maria scored in his debut in the Champions League and helped PSG on Tuesday to beat the Swedish team Malmo.
Here is a report about the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani scored in both of Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain started its journey in the Champions League final by a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmu at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after its debut in the Champions League and this player is PSG sent the French champions for the victory, but then threw away several chances, and finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a goal in 61. minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in the group, and therefore the team Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions, as the focus not only on qualification to the finals rounds, but on the improvement of their trip to the quarterfinals, which recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even if you get the three points, it was not a classic performance Team Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was the front of the goal and was later relieved by the prodigal against my home team and the Club, in which he began his illustrious career in 1999.
"In the Champions League is not easy to win outside or at home, so a win 2-0 makes our opponents problems and look comfortable in defense is a good start, although there are things that we have to improve with the passage of the season," said Blanc.
It is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we are nevstřelili of one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic came back after the injury as one of three changes to the team that earned PSG at home this weekend to draw 2-2 with Bordeaux in League 1, but in the fourth minute was overshadowed by Di Maria.
The Argentine winger was identified as the man who pushed PSG in Europe to a new level after transferring from Manchester United, which took place last month, and he showed why when he kicked the pass of Marco Verrattiho for the defense of the Malma and beautiful ending sent the ball behind his back to a remote corner of Johan Wilanda goals.
However, if someone was expecting it starts up a spectacular victory, PSG had to be disappointed.
Malmo, which beat Celtic in the playoffs and got to this stage, competed with 9 international in the base report, and the five defenders and two midfielders were draped in a heavy contender.
But in addition to the missiles, which only as Nikola Djurdjice just missed the remote corner of the goal in 34 Kevin Trapp's House. minute, that many in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves but for the benefit of the poor passing game and attack the lousy ending, that was not good, nor from the Ibrahimovice, who could not shoot or five times in the first half, and was then disappointed, because his shot got to the network shortly after the start of the second half of the Cavani.
However, much more likely, showed up when it came to preparing the chances for his teammates, and it was from his passing, when Di Maria sent a točivou shot that ended in the Wilandově goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of the game thanks to Cavanimu, Uruguayec for this header line is already the sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic midfield after the pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
It ended any thoughts about the possibility that Malma could take advantage of the match, and only the excellent operation of the nearby Wilanda thwarted hope David Luiz and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of relieving Ezequiel Lavezziho at the end of the match unacceptable.
Team coach Malmo Age Hareide subsequently admitted that PSG were a class above his team, Nor stated: "our last game in the Champions League took place in December of last year."
Since then, we played just the Swedish League, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
For them it was a breathtaking match.

How's refugee crisis has shattered the Schengen area.
Emergency flares when you launch Germany by far the nestmelila European crew, but already forces the ship to change course, written by the French daily Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the problem of refugees: first will be more systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as soon as he sets foot on the old continent – especially in Greece than to fight for the future distribution of refugees under quotas on the basis of the quantities that are increasingly diverged from reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 countries of the EU, to přerozdělily 160 thousand refugees, changed the Interior Ministers of the Member States a priority.
Than to worry about the final destination of migrants, it is first necessary to filter those arriving today and resolve the fate of those who move within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the external borders of the EU, it is necessary for the management of migration," underlines in the text projednaném Ministers on Monday in Brussels.
After the common currency's crisis finds the EU that is in danger in his next large integration project.
Germany is perhaps surprised, but does not lose its decisiveness and increases the pressure.
Restores border control, in particular with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in this country.
The central power that makes clear, that without it there is no free movement in Europe.
Serve it as a proof, that Austria and Slovakia on Monday to join this action.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and France even thinking about that also, although with different intensity.
Hungary, the authorities agreed to long ago.
This exceptional and temporary measures are in accordance with the rules of the Schengen area.
That it is a domino effect, but also blind.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now effective mandatory input controls in Greece, southern Italy and Hungary also for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed intensively about it during a private conversation with his three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but realizes the stiff.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics were already registered and identified, removing fingerprints, two thirds of the newly arrived refugees.
Budapest refuses the introduction of any entry point on its territory, because they fear more than the other, so that the shoulders remain camps, in which refugees would accumulate on her account.
The real black hole remains Greece.
On its islands near the Turkish coast had landed in this year more than 200 thousand people, which is twice more than the recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are asylum seekers, who came directly from Syria after they passed through the crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which are still in the financial turmoil and that they are waiting for a new Government, passed his hands into her lap.
It is the starting point for the Balkan way and now common source of worry for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Junckerova, the Commission promises to establish control points occurs as soon as possible, but gave no number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece, apply to the whole of Europe," agreed with the Union's Interior Ministers on Monday to mobilize on this front.
It is therefore in this country, the teams of the European Agency for border control, Frontex.
The EU wants to help Greece to expand its capacity for the reception of asylum seekers, and strengthen supervision over the Islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be Needed," warns the text presented to Ministers for approval.
From the perspective of the law will continue to have the last word Athens.
The question of the emergence of a real European border guards was not officially raised, but Europe's coming.
The new emergency situation as osmadvacítky slid on the other track the question of mandatory quotas and 160 thousand refugees, which earlier this year introduced Junckerova, the Commission and the European Parliament, and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and the French President, François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to even hear about it.
Consider it an attack on its sovereignty.
Of the number, but not the obligation to, on Monday was retained in the text approved by a majority of osmadvacítky.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only hard promise includes the reallocation of 40 thousand refugees in the next two years, which was already reached agreement in June during a hectic Summit concludes in Le Figaro.
