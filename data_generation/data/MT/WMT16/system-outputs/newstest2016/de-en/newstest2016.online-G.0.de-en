In an emergency call Professor admits, to have his friend shot
In an emergency call, told Professor Shannon Lamb with a slightly trembling voice to the police that he had shot and killed his girlfriend, and that the officials would have to come to his house.
Lamb, it was important to emphasize that "sweet dog", but live, and probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a hand written note that was scrawled on a white Block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman that loved me, ever". This was according to the authorities, in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two Online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he has shot according to the police, a popular history Professor Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office and killed.
Delta State University chief of police Lynn Buford said that University employees have heard of the shooting at 10:18 PM.
He said that Lamb has made the fateful emergency call sometime after that.
Up to the end of the day, there was another death: the lamb took his own life, as the police encircled him.
A day after the shooting in the University, forcing students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are trying still to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The investigators at both Ends of the state published Details, as well as what students and staff who knew him have testified, helped to draw a picture of a talented, but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said that they looked forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a written book, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of social Sciences and history, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students of the courses of the two.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to exhibit problematic behavior.
A Student, Brandon Beavers, praised Lamb said, he seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another Student, Mikel Sykes, said that lamb told him that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014-15 with Stress.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons and said that he had some kind of health Problem.
This year he taught only two Online courses.
Latest Changes in employment policy of the University meant that the Promotion had worked for the Lamb so hard, for him there is no guarantee for an automatic route to employment as an Assistant Professor.
University President William LaForge said, he knows nothing of a conflict between the Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. lamb's idea."
These are questions that can not answer Lamb.
After the escape from the Campus, the police found later, Lambs lane, when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas imports.
Before he could be arrested, killed the Lamb himself even with a .38 calibre pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile South of his parents ' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people that lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began its work in 2009, at the University, which has 3,500 students in a town of about 12,000 inhabitants, and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in the spring in pedagogy.
One of the long-time Friends, Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15, and the lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
You and your friends were in High School, and he was the cool older guy who tried for a few years, the guitar teaching.
At that time he was the heartthrob.
All the girls melted away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were together for obviously some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife", but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had adjacent to a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick-house on a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was fine.
The Ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'steen said, you were divorced 15 years ago, but friends had stayed, and a daughter had, who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," said O'Steen on his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had taken a Lamb, but his daughter Abigail that he had heard that Lamb was interested in music and Blues played.
Lamb met with Prentiss, when he and Abigail, three years ago, occurred both on a summer-year market.
Later, they played together, one or other of the Gig.
O'Steen said, his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and, sometimes, entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit Bar in the vicinity of Gautier, said that he Lamb, and Prentiss Night in the night 5. September for the last Time saw, after Lamb, his guitar and harmonica playing stopped in front of a sparse audience had finished.
There was no indication that anything is wrong.
"Just a happy Couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, you both had a good sense for humor.
Schmidt, the dead Professor, was head of the freshman seminar program, and specialized in native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a Professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas, and was President of his fraternity and the student's Committee.
On the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people took part on Tuesday evening, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the vigil, while the University choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lessons will be taken on Wednesday.
"We try to move our students to return," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying that Lamb made the call after he had shot Schmidt, and that lamb in his distress call described Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two ever got married.

8 survey values, the show that Donald Trump should be taken seriously.
Some have tried him as a Flop.
Others have him dismissed as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to pull the Donald Trump of the top ranks in the polls below, it has not worked (yet).
Ten of the last eleven national polls, Donald Trump showed double-digit lead, and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of the nomination of the real estate Moguls.
Of course, it is still too early in the term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that to be delivered this time, in 2011, Rick Perry's guide to the ascendant Herman Cain, none of whom won a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a General election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC, and the conservative business group Club for Growth Trumps now see-through and start to make your dollars flow, to overthrow him.
Here are some of the current survey are not values that indicate that the real estate Mogul is only a temporary Phase:
Trump's popularity ratings have turned around 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, showed a poll by the Monmouth University that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate Mogul is positive.
Until the middle of July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these Numbers hold in the early States.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa found last week that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters the GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a survey conducted by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "delighted" or "satisfied", if Trump would be nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "delighted" vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they are "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush is the favorite of the Establishment, the candidate would be.
A majority of Republicans Trumps Temperament does not see as a Problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for its bombastic and offensive statements, believe 52 per cent of the to tend to the Republicans, the Irish voters that the real estate Mogul have the right Temperament for a President, ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number is in the first pre-election state of the Nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent do not think that he had the personality to effectively be the office, and almost six out of 10 Independents say that his Temperament did not fit into the White house, so ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When you put your Gelehrtenhüte, to keep Republican voters Trump for real.
When you are asked who will win the most the GOP nomination, say according to a poll by CNN/ORC from last week's four out of ten, that Trump was the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July your money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters the clearest crystal ball had not in the past.
To thinking at this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans that Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Romney, Mitt.
However, a variety of GOP voters Trumps reputation campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to trump leadership, while the Anti-Trump Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates, diffuse.
But a survey by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump the majority garners support.
He has Carly Fiorina a 13-point lead, ahead of Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker with 15 points, ahead of Jeb Bush by 19 points and, finally, in front of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie's 33 points.
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A slight majority of Donald-Trump-Fans says that you have formed your opinion.
A new survey from CBS/NYT on Tuesday, shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump, say that you have awarded your votes.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really tell you to never change the opinion.
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, trump's strongest competition at the Moment, the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that you have formed your opinion, are twice as likely to be for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump said in his campaign speech two months ago, immigrants from Mexico, "rapist", was turning the immigration the focal point in the public discourse to 2016.
Some are worried that the bombastic manner of expression, Trump will hold a crucial Hispano-Americans from the Republican party remote and the Neuorientierungs efforts will damage it.
But according to the new ABC/Post poll from Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump in matters of immigration.
Thus, as long as immigration stays in the spotlight, Donald Trump, apparently.
The Frustration over the government's climb to new highs.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson about half of the support of Republican voters now account for, especially by their outsider Status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, you prefer a political outsider as someone with government experience.
And they are also angry at Washington.
A survey of the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Iowa two weeks ago, shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans than the Republicans are frustrated in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellishly angry".

"We will not underestimate them", had Bayern promised captain Philipp Lahm before the game at the Karaiskakis stadium in front of 31.688 hot-blooded Fans and the Munich kept their word.
They showed a focused and determined performance to Shine without.
Piraeus had won their most recent six home games in the Premier class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
Also, in 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) stumbled here.
But Bayern, in the seven European Cup matches undefeated with a Greek team, didn't want to be the next victim.
They went bravely ran, and with their offensive efforts, but often unimaginative.
The attacks have been initiated often by the game shift to the left Douglas Costa, against the former Braunschweig's Omar Elabdellaoui rarely came through.
Müller had struck from the right, more luck, as his cross from the right half of the box in the upper left corner of the net.
In the 67. Minute the champion of the world forgave the available 2:0.
The best opportunities in half of one for Robert Lewandowski.
First of all, as the Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown hit the head ball of the poles of the line (26.).
Then by direct acceptance, the goalkeeper Roberto with the knee parried (35.).
Although the Bavarians raised their usual dominant game, could of Piraeus needle to put stitches.
On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer leaving.
So, for example, when he deflected a shot from Ideye over the bar (56.).
Before Guardiola had a back four of David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng to defend, which made it good.
Mario Götze, muscular problems, back in the squad, was initially out there.
The world Cup Hero had only given after the completion of training, the green light, said sporting Director Matthias Sammer in the "Sky": "if you want to make something else of it, that is vicious".
Also during the first exchange Guardiola decided against him, when he brought Kingsley Coman for the battered Lewandowski (59.).
Götze came in late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and it all made 13 minutes later, a penalty, Müller put a.

Anyone who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Who smoke, which harms not only the lungs, but also the teeth - the Potsdam long-term study suggests.
The good news is that In the absence of the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.

People who stopped Smoking, may reduce your risk but within a short period of time, write the researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research".

Not Smoking is good for lungs, and blood vessels and leads according to our findings, also to good dental health into old age.
In Germany, about 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by tooth loss, according to the DIfE.
Previous studies had already noted that Smoking increased the risk for early Tooth loss.

Mr Corbyn will rise up to make the first of his six allotted questions shortly after noon, where his performance of the media probably and the Labour members, from the vicinity will be examined.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" in this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some of the meetings, to be left to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow Cabinet, and his speech at the TUC annual conference on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour leader, on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a memorial ceremony for the 75. To remain anniversary of the Battle of Britain, in silence, to criticism from a number of Tory MPs provoked, and multiple front-page Stories is the focus in the Newspapers.
Mr. Corbyns decision not to sing the national anthem, has drawn attention
A spokesman from Mr Corbyn said he had been "respectful silence" and that he had recognized the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the battle of Britain".
But a member of Mr Corbyns shadow Cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem, "regardless" of his Beliefs that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen of the shadow-Ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns top team, and they refer to the differences in the economic, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him initially, as a guide.
The Political correspondent of the BBC's Robin Brant says that political differences are stacked within Labour "" according to Mr Corbyns Comments on the Position of the European Union and of the limit Gain.

Metcash launches ground-employment-campaign to combat Aldi - incidence
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores in front of an Aldi onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-employment-campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $ 700 million Aldi-Invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first of 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, strengths, Metcash and IGA supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA by Mainstream Marketing and marketing through Social media, as well as through Events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA retailers and suppliers to jump on Board, with brands such as ice-cream Simmo from Dunsborough, which is to be distributed to IGA stores, samples, and shop owners, the reduced-price Tickets for the South Australian football League to a loyal customer sale.
It is expected that Metcash further Details of his defence strategy on the 29. Released September, when the leading wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment of its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at the game, as South Australia and Western Australia, almost 30 percent of Metcashs IGA stores and higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the Eastern States, generate.
Shoppers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts believe, such as Morgan Stanley, Aldi will snatch twelve months after the opening of its first stores about five percent of the food market in these two States and all the existing stakeholders, but mainly independent retailers, sales will take off.
In this week according to a report published by the Analyst Tom Kierath from Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers 360 $ million in revenues per year and Metcash could lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opened in the next year, 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery business and at the amounts on Metcashs high fixed cost base Metcash could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the Eastern States, mainly at Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA-buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley takes on that Metcashs sales in food and grocery business will drop to 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and to 2.1 percent in 2018, and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020 will reduce.
Last week, the leading Fund Manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash is likely within a decade. Metcash disappear.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to the comments of Mr. Douglass.
But it is assumed that a Board has included a member of the Metcash with Mr. Douglass, last week contact.
IGAs share of the market has fallen since 2010, from 18 percent to 14 percent, and income from Metcashs food and food trade, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen since 2012, a 43 percent reduction in the operational debt at the same time, pressure on sales and margins reflects.
The wholesaler fights, however, and invested more than $ 150 million, in order to improve selling prices with Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products each week to align and IGA retailers in improving their stores by faster-growing fresh food and to deliver a better selection of private Label foods.
Metcashs chief Executive Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and Charge-restructuring programs will increase in vigor and hopes that the large-scale return to the dealer in the year 2017, for the first Time in four years, earnings growth.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis earned more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and earned according to the President of the Australian tennis Association, Steve Healy more praise than criticism for its own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the youngest of the talented Duo, will always be referred to as the "Special Ks", was the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters into the limelight.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be twice separated by the referee, with Harrison exclaimed: "Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen as he smashed a tennis racket after a spasm foiled a potential US Open victory with Richard Gasquet, was Kokkinakis of Healy staunchly defended.
The Teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against great Britain.
"One thing that I ereifere me pretty, is the fact that, according to my view, Thanasi a little in the dispute was dragged," said Healy.
He has broken a racket as he lost due to a spasm in the U.S. Open, but he is not the first player who has broken a racquet out of frustration with yourself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is proud of it.
But, really, he behaved the same way in the US Open extremely well, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison, and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great Team around him, he has a great family around you, and I think he was treated a little too harsh.
He is a very Mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in the Team and so on, he has never had a Problem with the other players, he is respected in the locker area, he trains hard, he is in good Form, he is a very stable and Mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be on its own merits evaluated.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios in the all-important preliminary, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as a right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra, as a long-term integral part of the Team to return."
"First of all, we hope that the Team is completely focused on competition and not on all the Controversy around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think that Nick has very quickly managed to the rise of what people like Federer and Murray pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the Public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him the consequences of his actions understandable. Some time outside of the spotlight, he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate and it is best for the team and it is the Best thing for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declared a state of emergency, closing the border, refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and sealed off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all of the feast who were trying to illegally come into the country. All with the goal to stop the influx of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants accumulated in a no-man's land and Serbian officials reacted in outrage.

Some of the back meadows to Protest food and water.
Serbia's foreign Minister, said it was "unacceptable" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be damage to part of the solution and not a collateral.
It must take place in the coming days in talks with Brussels and other countries," said Ivica Dacic, in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border, came a day after the 28-nation bloc could be agreed at a contentious Meeting in Brussels, a common immigration policy.
The Minister agreed, however, to share the responsibility for the 40,000 people who sought refuge in the took Italy and Greece. They expressed their hope, that eventually - in the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be obtained that the EU countries would take a further 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday for a special summit of the European Union, to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
Hungary has not continued, however, his hopes for a speedy action from Brussels or from its neighbors.
The on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis, so that they could cordon off roads and asylum procedures will speed it up.
The Hungarian foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is planning the construction of a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants by the country - after it has finished a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'agata reported that even prison inmates in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia, were used.
In the last few months, Hungary for many of the war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bottleneck and the entrance point into the European Union.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that the majority of Arrivals are refugees, who are in search of a better life, and not war refugees, who are entitled to protection - a view that is sharply at odds with other EU States, including Germany.
The new laws, which became effective at midnight, in Hungary, in force, to make the Crossing of the border or the Damage of the 4-Meter (13 feet) high fence by the government along the southern border to Serbia, to edify, to a crime. These laws set higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the Situation caused by the mass migration explains, the Hungarian government of the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
The Parliament has to agree in terms of procedure, nor the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but a Reporter from the Associated Press to the border and heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs have already seen for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security adviser for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people while trying to cross the border, the other 15 were already penetrated deeper into the country.
You come across, by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and the Commission of offences under the new laws.
Authorities are going to repair the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials concluded on Tuesday morning, two of the seven border crossings with Serbia, after a train car with barbed wire to close the borders, had arrived.
The Chaos surrounding the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as Hungary is a small office in a metal-opened Container to edit the data of people and a crowd of people pressed to try to hurry.
About 20 managed to get inside, but thousands remained outside.
A further group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter to Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut in half in a national survey
The former US Secretary of state Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her over.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primaries (58 per cent previously), while Sanders is in the second place, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, has not yet announced whether he's running for President, gets the support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the primaries.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, say the majority of democratic voters, that it is too early to say that, in your opinion, which candidate you support.
But Clinton's supporters are in your choice better than the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders scored a few wins.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and Moderates, but these projections have been reduced.
Your support for the men, has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under 50 years of age has vanished, and you and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton has a big advantage among the older voters.
In the past month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead for the liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the democratic voters in the primaries of the country say that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton, if she would be nominated by the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations and a further 15 per cent would support it only because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprising, that Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic.
The views are more mixed in the case of those who do not currently support Clinton, only about a quarter would you enthusiastically support.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters in the primaries to say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, say less Republican voters this on your top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters will be asked in an open question, why do you want that she is the candidate, is the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), followed by the view that it is time that a woman will be President (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the Job (10 percent).
Of Clinton's supporters, her connection with Bill Clinton (9%) is mentioned.
Consent to dealing with the problems and eligibility are also cited.
Since the Vice President casts a potential run for President in the pan, you want to see 57 percent of the democratic voters in the primaries him in the race, though a third believes that he should not do it.
If democratic voters in the primaries will be asked, who would be for the party their second choice, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
Not Biden, to run for the democratic nomination, will increase Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders, of 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chances to win the election; however, this figure of 78 per cent has fallen in the last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that views him as the "selectable", is increased.
Nevertheless, the question of what is a candidate key, call democratic voters questions about eligibility.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters in the primaries stands out as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates to provide good results in some of the most important characteristics in voters in the primaries of their party.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden, as honest and trustworthy, and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden cuts off at the three candidates is best at honesty, while Clinton's leadership.
Thirty percent of democratic voters believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters in the primaries, see generally Clinton, Sanders, and Biden is ideologically in line with their views.
In all of these measurements about a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal E-Mail address and a server during the term of office as foreign Minister, are the most Democratic voters in the primaries satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions.
But it is a different story to the American Public as a whole.
Half of Americans is now with your explanation dissatisfied, while only about one-third is satisfied.
The public opinion was in March, shortly after the Problem came to light, are cleaved.
The majority of Americans said that the E-Mail controversy had no impact on their General opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that it had worsened their opinion of her yet.
There are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy, this is still a Problem for you, registered voters, total: Only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points since may.
62 percent of eligible voters do not hold for a honest and trustworthy Person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the eligible voters of the country to see, far Trump as not honest and not trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades in leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Carson, and Bush cut Biden, and the best at honesty.
A majority of Sanders sees more than honest, but, like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson moves up in national poll, close behind Donald Trump
Ben Carson is the latest poll from CBS News/New York Times behind Donald Trump
The two candidates, half of the support of the voters in the new poll, has now been dropped, and others will lose dramatically to Stop
Republican voters support across the country continue to Trump in large numbers. The support is growing by 23 % in the last CBS poll, which was carried out before the Fox News debate last month, to 27 % in the survey from Tuesday.
But Carson shot in the same period from 6% to 23 %.
The survey also revealed that Carson demographic groups is well received and Trump among Republican voters with higher education exceeds.
The Rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is cut off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has been in the lowest, and 10 % support in the last month to now 2 %.
The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio with 6 % in third place.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 persons of Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Minus 6 % and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll, which was released last week, shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he ends up at 19 % support among Republicans, behind the Trump, with 32 % support.
The latest survey from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump well before Carson.
With a view to in the last week ascending Carson, Trump found some of the swipes for the former neuro-surgeon, even after Carson apologized for it, Trumps Faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.

Five members of the brotherhood with the death of a Baruch College freshman charged
Almost two years after a Student during a vexatious Ritual of a fraternity in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, died, filed murder charges against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College, Pi Delta Psi fraternity were attacked by Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction of ritual in September 2013, a brutal and delayed his Transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he had been charged with a blindfold with a 30-pound backpack full of Sand, and repeatedly been attacked, while he tried on a frozen field on a target approach.
Mr. Deng complained finally about a headache, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity is not called the emergency number 911, after Deng passed out and waited, allegedly, an hour before they brought him to a hospital, according to police.
However, they had the time to go to Deng's clothing, to contact its symptoms googling and Andy Meng, national President of the brotherhood, to seek advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the Welfare of the brotherhood, in principle, to the of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next Morning of his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng were added repeatedly with a blunt-force injuries to the head, the torso and the thigh.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the brotherhood. At least one Student dies since 1970, every year on the harassment," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Deng's family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step of the authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of murder in the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also accused of harassing attacks and of forming a criminal Association.
"We want to make not only the individuals involved responsible, but if there is an organization, which - officially or unofficially - sanctioned this, so we will have to take this to account," said Wagner at a news conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has declared their affiliation to the local Chapter.
That will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
A rate hike is coming, and the boom will falter, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is, how long will it take and how long it will last.
In particular, the story provides for economic low the instructions to the end.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted for 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in Raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial systems to respond.
Therefore, representatives of the US have stressed the Central Bank so violently that investors should focus on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather on the period of time that is needed for the normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, market participants may find, however, that all the excitement was exaggerated because of an increase in interest rates may.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be used by some as a Signal for the end of the Era of "cheap money" interpreted," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still on a low level, in order to lead to the seismic shock, the fear many seem to.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.
Here's a historical trend-based view of it is likely to react to, as some sectors of the economy:
As the market has in the last month seen, can make the anticipation of interest rate increases in things for a while volatile.
As soon as the increase arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that income on the assets 12 to 24 months will be stalled after the first increase, perhaps reflecting again the delay in the monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts happened in a recent study, which increases to interest rates by the Fed.
More specifically, the market is in the last 35 years, mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest rates fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter (average gain of 2.6 per cent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average yield in the last six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis, the Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, Barron's published.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the share tends to occur later in the hike cycle and the rate of return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but increases in interest rates, they often promote.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some of the conditions that existed before and which could hasten a recession.
Extremely noteworthy is that the gross domestic product will be in the vicinity of its lowest point in the case of an interest-rate increase by the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank was one of the 118 interest rate, the nominal GDP increases since 1950, only twice under 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, expect only a few that this will continue and expect for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed, only 1.5 percent.
Increases in interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this Time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have made throughout the year on an interest-rate increase by the Fed in focus, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and Economists believe that the FOMC could authorize an increase in this session, the Futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all of the increase in cycles from 1950 to today, in a Super-cycle took place with increasing momentum in GDP and in Front of-recession highs very soon after the beginning of the recovery in the shadow," the report said.
In contrast, this is a unequivocally slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed Phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest, the the Fed since the end of the last recession has been waiting for; the record was 35 months, and these are so far 74 months.
The fixed income is also volatile, as the market takes an increase in interest rates is anticipated, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect for bonds is faster than in the case of shares, if the change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, the yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease is done in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond fall yields immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
The strategist of Charles Schwab, believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds often bring in such a climate, better yields, although "we are still careful not to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting to note, Jones says that the markets have already adapted to the Fed-strategy-expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, Credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightened their strategy.
All in all, companies that handle the larger part of their business activities in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise, local products become more attractive.
Multi-national companies with high debt are worse off, because a rising Dollar makes their products in the global market, more expensive, and as well the financing of their debt.
"History shows that "quality" tend to share, three months after an initial rate increase to respond very positively to," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for the customer.
Companies with a strong balance sheet companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004, an average of 5 percentage points exceeded.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in its shares also outperformed their counterparts with lower quality on average in each of 4 (percentage points), and 3 (percentage points).
Debts become a big Problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates are losing the most, said Goldman.
Outside of pure share a consumer will benefit games also due to the rising Dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even if the experts are of different opinion, how quickly will this take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative member of Parliament, criticized the station because of its "dumbing down"
He argues that it is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He was also on the BBC Music Awards and said that it was only The Brits imitated
Parliament-Mr Damien Collins to handle the show, The Voice, and said that this was very original.
BBC Radio 3 "converts" to Classic FM, says a leading member of Parliament and increased pressure on the Sender to prove that he is not doing something to do private channels.
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said the BBC bosses, the public radio broadcaster, "dim", and not to be distinguished increasingly from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems to - I don't use the word "stupid", but it seems to turn up Classic FM," he said.
He was also on the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to The Brits to be under a different name.
So, if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously referred to examples in which you actually only imitate what is already on the market," said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director-General rejected the allegations and argued that the BBC Radio 3 sun far ahead of its commercial competitors, if it's music, and educating the Public to Live.
What I of Radio 3 learn, I will learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to Live music and making Music that is truly second to none.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to give new works in order that I think is really important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey, that worked harder in should be to engage the audience, as it did this in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music argued.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only Element of the BBC production, which fell during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture, media and Sport, under fire, to enter the commercial rival on the feet.
The Tory MP, Damien Collins handle The Voice on the musical Talent Show of BBC, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media, for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds.
You see, why this program is not often discussed, because it is original, and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted the BBC 1 Show with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - "in a special BBC way" was produced.
He added that he wishes that the company "find a Hit from our own Stall", when it start the next Time an entertainment series.
However, he refused the order of another series of The Voice in the future to exclude or money the fee payer for other entertainment formats.

It meant that more people were shopping online and that people were able to do this in different environments, e.g. at home on the Sofa.

The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, as a reason for the decline in sales ends quotes.
Experts believe that buyers keep their purchases prior to this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the past year, the average number of shoppers flocked to five times to your Computer in order to make their bargain, and some of the dealer Websites crashed.

For some products, such as televisions and washing machines more than a third of purchases are now carried out via Web-shop.
At the same time, more than a quarter of the people buy clothes and shoes online, rather than the fashion chains in the inner cities.

While this defender brought the left to cry to him for at least six months from the Games, exclude, Louis van Gaal, the hope is that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was due to a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15 Minute causing, after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will come tomorrow or maybe a day later relocated and then in Manchester surgery.
It is terrible - a Boy, comes with 18 to Manchester United, it is very hard, and then fantastic play, and then this happens.
In the locker room, he had an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture then it takes six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
I hope that he can play this season.

Certainly David Cameron, The Lorax knows better?
It is a thing that all parents soon learn: If your child is a book of loves, it will not take long until you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are, perhaps, David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems, his favorite-to name a children's book, decided to the Prime Minister for The Lorax, in 1971, published in environmental fable by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the Website of the company super camps, and continues: "funny, moving, creative, and with a powerful message, it is a book that I read to my children because it seems to always be a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, Cameron describes how, allegedly, the plot of the book, instead, a summary of the Film Version of 2012, the new characters and Details added, to extend the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all the nature is gone, and even the air is a commodity, in hopes of a Boy named Ted, to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, he fulfilled their desire to see a real tree," reads one. A love interest of Dr. Seuss, whose real Name is Theodor Seuss Geisel was and died in 1991, however, completely unknown.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough of Cameron's Text reads, in part, as the summary of the Lorax movie, which will be presented on the Website of the Internet Movie Database and so it begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, in hopes of a Boy named Ted, to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits Yes, to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron, the plot of the book is so little acquainted. Here is an unnamed Boy, how the local environment greedy by the money stops, trees cases, the Thneed knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the Lorax, a squat, moustached beings, "speaks in the name of the trees", is devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR has a delegated task to a helper that The Lorax didn't read 20 Times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the Text was likely to come from Cameron's constituency office.
Super camps confirmed that the Text was supplied by Cameron's staff, but gave no other immediate comments.

To face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but when selecting the squad, the England for the Tour, see, this is not a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat on my card.
I would not rule out an away win.
Alastair cook's side may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good Spin players in the Batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they will carry no scars of 2012, a youthful, positive attitude.
With the Ball, Moeen Ali developed as a Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, is an Option for the attack.
This related message: Adam Lyth retires from the England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision of Adam Lyth to leave out, of course, is for me as a head coach in Yorkshire, and difficult to analyze.
In his seven Tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There was no question mark at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since, as I have said before - players are their own best selector.
A long time ago, you would have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he fails, hopefully, more runs for Yorkshire, comes one more Chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss is not praised his attitude, even if he rendered such good services, and that doesn't surprise me; he is above all a Team man.
The question of how much time a Test batsman to put his characters is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - such as Sam Robson in front of him, while Nick Compton nine got.
Only Compton got a Chance to home and away games.
The only criticism one can raise, was that England Trott first began Jonathan in the Caribbean - as Lyth in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a batsman that I would estimate to be high.
He is an X-factor-cricket player, what we saw in Yorkshire early this season, when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge square, what struck us very much.
He must receive at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but this of course depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moeen in addition to Cook, which would provide an Extra Spin Bowler and four Quicks get, showed up, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a hit man can't hit, and this left-hander has already shown that he is one heck of a Cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his Job for his County, Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for you, and since there is no big difference.
My former team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first Drop, before he appeared in 2001 as an Opener.
He has made three hundred Runs immediately and not looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the squad as Back-up Spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he has impressed me as a young man, very.
People may have their stats - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the Ball - and think it is a Punt, but there is no large number of Backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn on this Tour a lot.
Apart from the team of England has made a couple of clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahlah Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a Meistercoup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game, will bring a Wealth of experience as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes on for the white ball Phase of the Tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the Setup.
I always felt that he is created for the international Cricket competition, as a player or as a Coach, and how Mahlah, he has insights from which we benefit.
Sometimes new voices can bring in the locker room fresh Wind, even if the messages are in accordance with the foregoing.
Collys team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used in the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and for my part, I have no Problem with it.
Some of you may not agree, but Coaches and team on the plates do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that, as for the players, their Jobs, the results depend on.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = exit of Britain from the EU) could gain in popularity if the economy up to the year 2017 in a lull
David Cameron's half-baked Renegotiation strategy in order to keep Britain in the EU, are advised with each passing day deeper in trouble, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or no?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, the split over Europe on Tuesday, sharply atomizer.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farage's.
A European diplomat friend said the other day that some of the member States, mired so deep in a number of crises, such as the EU, it is now time, and not always from their own fault, Britain's self-created Agenda with split concessions and disturbing changes to the contract that you do not want to usually are satisfied.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it is like this also, if they do not compromise social protection.
We could call it Dave and Georges Selfie Agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance of climbing to the summit meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that you have to win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend who wants an outside view, in the end, the UK Inside the EU tent - "don't Leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and suggests that more and more short-sighted Ministers and civil servants have come in some of the main cities up to the point where you don't care about whether we stay or go.
Germany's careful prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she's since 10 years in Power, and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for you, as it is done in the excessively long, Held-out, such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14), and cabbage (16).
Of France Francois Hollande looks on his re-election or his replacement in the year 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left.
It is hard to imagine that they will bend over backwards to help the Selfie-the British, whose energy should be better used gravel to prevent the country's exit from the UK - something you don't want to, because the most similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such Minister for planning may even be intentionally non-helpful notes, all in the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017, in order to speed up the Leaving process, presumed to be my friend.
"The renegotiation was a Bust" and "the UK has nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street may be at your cost, and which of the EU-skeptics is not the oligarchy of press barons, as they were during the Tony Benn inspired by the referendum in 1975, but that our entry in 1973, supported with a ratio of 2:1.
You can remember weak to Boris Johnson, the arch-Euro-opportunist who has made a name for itself as a "EU Straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90-ies.
In all of his madness, Ed Miliband, who were his enemies knew.
The Medley of tax-fear-rogue phone hack ends of foreigners and the Pseudo-Non-residents, who own most of our major Newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought the same way about you, but when you're sitting with a hot Gorilla in a cage, it is better distributed bananas to distract him, instead of his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairianer as Blair himself, as he sat down in Cameron's referendum vortex, because Blair had put the principle on the non-adopted Constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, opened a back door.
The press forgave him for that.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave it to me on Monday in Westminster a friendly Pat on the back - I told him that he need to waste any more time for me - seems to be in danger, Neil Kinnock's Boycott of Murdoch's strategy for the 80-to repeat it, a error then and now.
It may take a while, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, the BBC Sofa, he has to leave on Sunday.
Corbyns official Position of Europe is - and I Express it in a friendly way - in the development.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Now, most people outside of Ukips traditional Blue dye tendency and the Wilder climes of Tory Small-Englishman can tell everyone Yes.
It is what Hilary "A Benn but not a Bennite" Benn on the Radio and on television this week said, as the path struggled finder in it is not to admit that Corbyns appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's, when his old father tried in television so to be disloyal to his Labour Cabinet colleagues, without having to go too far and lose his Kabinettsjob.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight in order to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression was not what McDonnell said, what is told JC of his comrades-in-arms and deputies, after all the Reports on their exam session on Monday evening.
What is wants to convey is always the weepy Bottom-Up Image of Corbyn - remember that he even touched me - messages-discipline in the age of TV around the clock is important and, above all, in the maelstrom of Social media, a hotbed of Paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe, which allowed him to keep labour's support in the referendum campaign is a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyns basic ambiguities to the EU membership in accordance with its Bennite siege economy, its anti-capitalist past - is not only a question of esoteric discussion among the left of the dissidents, for the narcissism of the small difference is a Central tenet of dogmatic disputes.
As with its ambiguities to the Nato - Tom Watson is rock-solid convinced that JC does not start a campaign to exit will be required, and foreign diplomats to try to find meaning in everything for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin apply political capital to waste, - you have too suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if this can all be meaningless?
The US are already pretty disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, in Libya and in Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in Power, what I at the Start on Monday of something that was reminiscent of what was called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize report from Public Health England about E-cigarettes
Allegations of a government-funded Agency that E-cigarettes are less harmful than Smoking arose from a Meeting of 12 people, some with Connections to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), were joined by the Lancet, by criticizing the Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes used in evidence.
PHE has published the "basic report" in the last month, and describes him as a "comprehensive Review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data in question and highlighted the Connections between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal the Lancet last month to handle the "extremely windy" basis, the PHE his main conclusion is justified.
Two researchers writing in the BMJ, and asked whether the statements "build on rock or Sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape corrugated, Professor of Clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health strategies on the demonstration of efficacy should be based."
They said that the Public expects, that the claim of PHE that "the current best estimate is that E-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than Smoking," based on a detailed Review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people, were convened in order to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis-MCDA) to guide their opinions about the harms of nicotine-containing products of a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Cape well said, that is a Sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health, whose managing Director is previously from British American Tobacco middle (BAT) for an independent study.
He also references of BAT wrote to the Public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the Meetings said, to receive funds from an E-cigarette manufacturer, but not the financing, he will have to Report in advance from the tobacco company Philip Morris International will receive, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the Board are not supplied, but several well-known E-cigarette Champions, some of which also specify a industries-Finance in the paper.
Some of the other participants in this meeting are not known for their Expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting, the tobacco-pipe of PHE took part.
The research work of the group, "admits, tellingly," that there is a lack of "hard Evidence of the damage of most of the products in most of the criteria," wrote McKee and Cape as well.
However, none of these Compounds or limitations in the PHE report is discussed.
McKee and Cape well said that the claims of PHE, that "there is no evidence that E-cigarettes as a way to Smoking for children or non-Smoking" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director for health and wellbeing at PHE, said that the allegations of BMJ previously was not responding.
He said: "E-cigarettes are considerably less harmful than Smoking."
Every second of life long smokers dying of his Addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of E-cigarettes in comparison to low, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to provide Information to the Public about what the evidence proves and what it is not, especially when so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to Smoking, and Smoking, the National health system costs two billion pounds per year.
Through the clear is not Present the current Evidence that E-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by Smoking, are present, we fulfill our national responsibility.
The BBC should EastEnders give up, says a former boss of Channel 4
The former Chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop to send programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "would give their right Arm" for Hit Shows such as the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for you to place public service programmes, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard controversial window of time against the most popular Shows of their rivals and of channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried for six years during his time at Channel 4, without success, to come up with the BBC in contact.
"I have problems with the idea that the BBC are programs in order, or sends, which would also clearly shown of non-subsidised rivals," said Johnson in the house of lords communications Committee's inquiry on the future of the BBC.
If you don't want to keep the licence fee, which I think is in the medium or long term is a good idea, you should.its production, at least on programs that do not make others, or in order to give
Send The Voice in a first-class window of time, because you want to reach the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would, this show is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is nonsense, of course.
Johnson said: "I can see why a regressive tax funded programs, which could also be without the subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is a further, admittedly, both productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right Arm for.
I'm trying to see how this is to be public-broadcasting.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a contractor for the series, the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 was head, said that the BBC is to blame for the hunting for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments to the most popular broadcasts of the BBC's what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, who in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell Shows such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they perform their tasks, and you can argue, if you go to your hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion pounds of licence fee, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
Put it in a window of time in which nobody wanted to see ever.
The licence fee Johnson told the Committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive System, in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from it.
Of course you all think, we all think that you can get for £ 150 per year, here is a great value, but for people who is for the 150 £ is a lot of money, wonder if that's true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 boss, David Elstein, who testified before the Committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian Mission "to inform, to educate and to entertain".
He said, only a little of the BBC production would now be classified officially as an education - he said that it had 1% of their TV-production and 0.1% in the Radio and you should take to the public television stations in Australia and Canada is an example of this change in "inform, educate and entertain".
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful of shown on television and with the commercial broadcasters form alliances, to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics can tax the brain cells by sound waves
The Video shows how the nematodes change direction in the Moment, in the sound pulses are irradiated.
Scientists have worms with genetically modified nervous systems bred, which can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction in the moment that you are with the sound impulses, which have for the human ear to high frequencies to be heard, to be irradiated.
The impetus to work through the Switching on of the motor neuron cells that have been genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
To read further on this topic: researchers and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the Power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, the ultrasound can be used to solve a series of brain-, heart -, and muscle-activating cells outside of the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure might one day replace Deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure, the electrical impulses in the brain of people used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Roundworms do not typically respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles of air.
The blow, he found out, amplifying the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures, the TRP-4 ion channels and in the membranes of some of the worms cells are found.
The sound waves cause the Opening of ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-guided cyst nematodes, changed Chalasani genetically the worms so that some of your motoneurons TRP-4-carrying ion channels.
When applying ultrasound to the changed creatures, bubbles in the sound waves by the micro-reinforced and in the worms, where you turn on to invoke the motoneurons.
The method has some Similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking Tool that enables scientists, neurons with pulses of light on and off.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light, which must be sent to an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain down, can pass through low frequency ultrasound waves the tissue without hindrance, and can be in the brain from the top to the skull sent.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic Virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound Signal in a clinical setting for specific neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and Insulin-producing cells, he added.

The View of the UK arms trade to shame
Amnesty International, Anti-weapons trade watch Video.
Horrible Killer-Drones!
Ankle shattering leg shackles!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock rods, the agonizing cause pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and the Cartoon-pictures leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair, is a militant parody, which was produced by Amnesty International, the willingness of the British government to bring this issue into the spotlight, to sell weapons to repressive regimes across the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign, also leads to many of the posters that you see at bus stops and in the subway trains and require a second look.
"Important announcement: from 15. to 18. September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) to read in the font of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, is transformed to the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will continue with the DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.

The Amnesty Video has been viewed more than 100,000 Times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by advertising Agency VCCP, which operates a non-profit with the graphic designer and Voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative Director Matt Lever was astonished at the silence which reigned around, the advertising for the gun show - by-ExCeL-calendar - and thought: "we Give you the campaign, which is trying to avoid you."
They played with the invention of a new, more realistic, dodgy advertising, but "the Asking with bright colors and Animation, it is still stronger."
"You have done a fantastic Job by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," said Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is the Intervention of the British government, and the guarantee that torture devices are not traded in front of our door illegally.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area inside of ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.

Eight Golden rules for living in halls of residence
Eleven years ago, I as a self-forgotten 19-Year old in a Dorm, still in the Faith of Berets and moral relativism, but it is only now that I remember the strained Smiles of those who I have annoyed and to the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The catchment in the student residences ranges from the slightly nerve-wracking to downright terrifying.
It is tempting to talk to: people tell where you come from, whether and where you the Sabbath, have taken, where they stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "honestly Marmite neither love nor hate, because Seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you people find out that you like, in contrast to those with whom you would not speak, even if your eyelashes were on fire, and this fire extinguisher would be.
You Can People.
The room of people transform often, drinks receptions, Film-night venues and local hangouts, but they are also the Places where people wear their underwear right now.
Related to: not remember, at University, with a relationship to start
Introverts get a rough treatment at the University.
Your room should be a refuge, but many of the student residences to form a room-to-room-shopping-culture that is friendly and social, and to lead life-long friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say: "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away, so I get the energy I've consumed for the interaction with you."
You try to feel, when a fellow student of socializing is exhausted and you send him a text instead of knocking.
Speaking of waiting: Do it.
A guy in my student halls of residence had the idea that a locked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friends by baking.
As you start University at the height of the Baking-mania, is the Knock on the doors of people to come up with a plate full of Brownies to present less strange than the greeting of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, now please smile, if I ask you a few personal questions."
Homemade Treats are a good way to make friends is to offer.
Your roommate feel obligated to entertain, and will associate at the end of maybe your face with a delicious Surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent Baker.
Bad lumps from flour, sugar, and fat mixed cause people to be asleep when you knocked.
To steal food, homes, a common crime in student housing.
Of course, the Mouth of chicken is a theft, but it is Taking a drop of Lactobacillus for your tea?
Check with the dairy owner.
The chances are good that you say to support yourself, even if you cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, this is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but they are trying to make a balanced deal as my roommate, the milk a detergent added, to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
You should not make any noise, the people from sleep or work.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but that they belong in the truest sense of the saying to the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my floor asked your neighbors whether you'd mind, to Drum & Bass a bit quieter, because it's three o'clock in the morning, and you had an exam Tomorrow.
They responded with even louder music.
When they stopped, finally, at 5 o'clock, let your neighbors in a friendly manner, sleep on it for two hours before they had their own music blaring, your door graduated and went of their three-hour examination.
It would be romantic, if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same Dorm?
Conversely, it would not be profoundly embarrassed if you keep a roommate for your future spouse, you go for it, again disconnect and you will then have to see every day and maybe see how she pulls all the common friends to be over?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try to at least, to your abdomen a bit of reason to convince.
In the exciting Moment in which you notice that someone let his keys in his locked room, is the border between a joke and bullying is fine, as it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it just eyes take glances, until he becomes a boomerang.
You give by Hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but they mess it up never someone's room with toothpaste and Shampoo.
You close your door and place your keys in a glass of water, which is then set in the freezer - but you staple your possessions to the ceiling is not more than twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, Single parents, low-income earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner building in the Franconian city of Eckental number of houses for people who don't have a lot of money.
So for example, for refugees - but also as a Signal: "Not only refugees in need of Wohnhraum, but also the single mother and low income earners."
"I will show how one can, even today, cheap and good build," says the 44-Year-old in the Interview
Thousands of refugees are entering the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created: It builds in a project row houses for the refugees.
Mr. Gildner, many of the refugees are entering the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass housing in containers, or gyms has no sustainability.
Because the people remain to a large extent here.
In view of the refugee flow, we also need in the next few decades, plenty of living space.
A simple, three-storey row house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least amount of space.
It facilitates the Integration.
This is different when you bring people in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses that are currently built into the pilot project consists of three residential units for each of the four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many of the refugees are to say, it is peace again, I go back.
Then the houses can be converted easily according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro, without the land.
The is manageable.
Six months of the construction lasted.
The is appropriate.
Complicated building codes, your plans?
Gildner: by law I have withdrawn my project correctly.
Particularly complicated it's always, the looming sword of Damocles special construction and the Parking regulation.
Creepy.
It is always still, anyone who creates, in a row house of three apartments, one needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities of the place.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How was the reaction of the residents for your house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me, to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What definitely is not true.
But they are not increasing the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: True is: We had in the last five years, a construction boom in Germany, but luxury apartments that can barely afford a more were built.
My project has the message, even the normal people are in need of housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or low-income earners.
I show how one can, even today, cheap and good build.
That's about it.
Markus Gildner (44) studied micro system technology in Regensburg and initially environmental analyses.

Rosberg's only motto: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the battle for the world title in formula 1 against his clear leading Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton, only a slogan: "a Full attack".
The world Cup Second stressed before the Start in the crucial seven-Overseas-race, "I have nothing more to lose".
53 points separate the Vice-world champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday by defending champion and Two-time Champion Hamilton.

"Now the border will be driven inspections at our southern border," said interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls on the Hungarian border to remain in parallel to maintain.
To be clear, that anyone who wants to make an asylum application could also do this "of course".
The care and safety of the people standing in the foreground.
Clearly, however, that "clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we accept limitless migration flows, not on the Austro-Slovenian border.
It takes a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering the "corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia was willing to let refugees arriving in the direction of Austria and Germany travel and, under certain circumstances, also corridors for the refugees to build.
So Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar saw this interior in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will rather intensify the Monitoring of the border, especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia was controlled as an external border of the Schengen area, however, is already strong.
As the Minister stressed, does not want to Slovenian seal off its borders for refugees.
"Each EU-member has to fill in his obligations, otherwise the System cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
The Croatian government has announced that it, too, had tried the first refugees already in the night hours of Tuesday, in Eastern Croatia at the border crossing Tovarnik/Sid over to enter to the registration to avoid.
The Croatian police could pick up in the middle of corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees a meeting since then in Croatia, Tovarnik constantly.
It was mostly Syrians and Afghans, many of them women and children.
Also rescue services and the Red cross were already in use.
In the coming days, be country expect around 4,000 refugees, said Minister of the interior Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border would be redirected in the direction of Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade but denied she was there, the people instructing certain routes to pursue: "Neither can we, nor do we want to do this", it said.
According to the media for the first Bus with about 50 refugees had to report anyway, in the Morning in the Serbian border town of Sid arrived, in the course of the day, more buses would be expected.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants had been all night, from around 500 miles away Macedonian border with Serbia on the way.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed down, so we were told by the police that we are here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
So it might come actually to the observers already predicted a shift of the previous Balkan Route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly more westerly track.
Croatia: "Extensive opportunities for border control"
Croatia's interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared for the case of a strong influx of refugees, plans for possible emergency situations.
The Details he mentioned, he pointed out, however, that Croatia, as a Non-Schengen-member "comprehensive border control".
They perform strict checks in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia belongs to this, since 2007, the EU-partners from the country since then, consistently a good testimony to what concerns the Standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, approximately 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the previous night at the border crossing Horgos, leads to Röszke,.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely locked.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border, is still unclear.
The Serbian Minister of interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried on Wednesday morning for a look at the place in Horgos to calm down: He'll keep the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed is premature.
It would act not currently pay a very high Refugee.
One could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helper to rates of migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already started to distribute it to the refugees in the country cards on which alternative routes through Croatia.
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia, however, is not harmless: In Parts of the border area, there is also 20 years after the end of Croatia's war is still not cleared mine fields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a Team of bomb-disposal experts in the border region was sent.

FedEx a result of mixed financial Outlook for 2016 is lowered
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit Outlook for the whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said that it plans, about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday hire.
To be announced this time last year, FedEx, the company wants to hire a 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell about 2.5 percent in Premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said, to earn a profit between 10,40 $ 10,90 $ in the fiscal year that ends next may, 20 cents less than the previous forecasts.
Analysts expected, according to a survey by FactSet 10,84 $.
The lower view comes in spite of the price increases an average of 4.9 percent and 4. January effect and, despite the higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large packages, which will be collected starting in November.
The company said that it still expect that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost-cutting, higher revenue, and because of the growth in Online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides a solid income, if one takes the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade into consideration".
The plans for the vacation-employment were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, is planning to go on, 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, on the 31. August ended, and earned FedEx 692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share amounted to 2,42 $ per share, just behind the 2,44 $ per share, the twelve of Zacks Investment Research surveyed analysts predicted.
Sales rose by 5 percent to 12.3 billion $.
Six of Zack's analysts interviewed expected to 12,23 billion $.
FedEx has made in recent years, a decline in international priority shipping, which brought the turnover in his unit Express shipping to Stagnate.
But the Boom in Online Shopping has increased the results in the case of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter of the turnover of the ground transport rose by 29 per cent, but operating profit was essentially flat due to higher costs for larger packages, and self-insurance.
The Express recorded higher revenue due to higher prices, while the earnings due to higher labour costs in the freight business declined.
In Premarket trading about an hour before the Opening, dropped the FedEx stock is 3.85 $, or 2.5 percent, to 150,15 $.
On Tuesday they closed with an 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on may 11. June.
On their most anticipated meeting in years of the Federal Reserve to spend strategists for two days this week, around a 27-foot Honduran-mahogany table in the sitting position, in order to decide whether it is time, for the first Time in nearly a decade, raise the key interest rate.
Looming menacingly over them at one end of the ornate, two-storey meeting hall, there is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that the Fed should set Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues on the economic interests of the Nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from the Congress: maximize U.S. employment, and prices here are stable.
But since the great recession, the Fed's leaders have recognised that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too tight to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start, to be of the unprecedented stimulus by the near Zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008 weaned.
Although most of the data of the economy show that it is growing solidly, could make the recent turmoil in the global financial markets, the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to add to this volatility by raising the interest rate for Federal loans - and it was also only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and Inflation will be in the first line the most important thing you observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & co.
"But I think, if you were not looking for a pretext to increase the interest rate, is the increased uncertainty around the global market, enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what will the Fed do, what is insecure in themselves the financial market.
About half of the Economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg, have said a rate increase this week before.
The financial markets expect a Wait for the Fed, a key indicator, which indicates only a 30% Chance of an increase.
This suggests a decline in the stock market, if the Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial jumped in average value to 228,89 points, or 1.4 %, to 16.599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed's policy keeps the set in this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a Surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time," he said.
If you do it, "she would have to go in your statement, very far, to calm the financial markets in order to panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm the financial markets, because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed to be well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer, that you expect this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be required, an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed in August, was the improvement on the labour market in this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month, the lowest for more than seven years, and in the vicinity of the level that the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of a recovery.
And although Inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, said the Fed representatives that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower Oil prices.
The "economy can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world flashed at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell in may by more than 16 % below its peak, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow the global growth.
The market has recovered a little this month, the Dow is now up almost 10% below the High in may.
For the Fed-representative of the market turbulence affecting the complex calculation, when should the interest rates increase.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news would not be about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last couple of weeks, you would attract in this session, take the reins," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Central Bank.
Now he predicts that you will at least have to wait a month to get the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data, describing the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Fed, therefore, it should not be technically involved in their decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed is a monetary authority in the world has become.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere note of the former head of Ben S. Bernanke in the year 2013, that the Fed could its monetary Expansion "narrow", and caused confusion around the globe.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, can not be expected from the Fed representatives that you simply monitor developments elsewhere, but also with other Central banks, and experts advise you to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is more art than science, "" said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for the management of the assets of the company Envestnet, Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noticed this month that "the Fed has a history of over-reaction to financial market movements, which are not associated, apparently, with the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, de is committed to an increase in interest rates, the quoted decisions in the years 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings", in spite of limited discernible impact on growth in the United States," said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives made these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the Market meltdown in 2008 in the first place, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee for interest rate setting by the Bank of England.
The recent turbulence will not come close to this level, he said.
"You don't want to certainly get to a Situation in which you fear a rate rise, because the markets get upset," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not to mention the financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think you should rush ahead of the time.

"I have spoken with the Slovenian Minister of the interior, and if it is necessary, we will organize a corridor," said the Croatian Minister of interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is part of the Schengen Zone.
The EU country, Croatia is not a Schengen country.
After the foreclosure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people had come across the border at Tovarnik, reported the Croatian television channel RTL.
Hungary had blocked off the day before its border for refugees.
New laws that came into force the same day, also ordinary asylum procedure in Hungary is practically superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "you can travel through, and we prepare ourselves for this possibility."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
There are, however, people who do not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had taken up the Morning the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia.
Most of them came according to media reports from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came with the Bus as well as taxis in the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival they had tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter fences on the Border.
The border strip poses other hazards: unexploded mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 90s.
Deminers are now rapidly create a safe Passage.
Hungary hardly more refugees to come, however, after the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 apprehended people.
Shortly before closing time on Monday, it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws, the Overcoming and damage to the border fence as a criminal Offence.
In the southern-Hungarian border town of Szeged were, therefore, initiated 35 criminal proceedings.
The Convicted person may be imprisoned for up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, you've taken on Tuesday in the new on the border "transit zones," a total of 94 applications for asylum, of which almost all - 93 - at the most important Transition Röszke.
Among the applicants of 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, had lived there for 40 refugees.
Virtually nobody, however, has a view to get in Hungary granted asylum.
According to the Hungarian view, Serbia is a safe third country.
The rejected asylum seekers should be deported.
In front of the "transit zone" in Röszke only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke workers started to clean up.
They collected the waste, the tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks on the roadside had left.
Barrier were reduced and one of the reception camp in the border town was rebuilt.
The goal of this tag want to Express no one.
Austria reach after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
Around 20,000 migrants according to the government, but still in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the onward journey to Germany.
The train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities.
In Freilassing smaller groups of refugees met regularly to walk.
The mayor went "Stranded" across the border
"We were under the bridge festival on Sunday with the clean-up engaged, when suddenly ten people with suitcases at the entrance of the tent", so Wernsteins mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted the train to Passau.
Because Germany had set out on Sunday but because of the refugee flow of the rail traffic with Austria, surprisingly, was in Wernstein circuit," said Stadler, who offered his help, and the Stranded along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the Nearby Passau chauffeured.
Previously we have catered for the unexpected guests, with snacks and drinks.
We have said that we bring you by car to Passau.
"For us, this was, of course," said Stadler in the OÖN.
They were very grateful.
A man had to hand over a generous donation of 100 Euro for the fire Department.
"That made us very happy," said Stadler.
The stranded Passengers were moved on Sunday evening in catfish of a ICE in, take the regional train in the direction of Passau, Germany, to try to make it to the short-term, promulgation, that the railway transport was set to Germany, but still over the limit.

In Wernstein the cross-border is generally higher in the course.
The bridge's Association with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday sociable, the day before a two-bridge run sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
That Viktor Orbán sends many Thousands more of us, is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the warehouse Röszke immediately in the construction of structures, the humanity, to ensure that has brought our Chancellor, officially and publicly, the attitude of the Hungarian government into the orbit of national socialism.
Bear the brunt of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now facing in the border areas with chaotic conditions.
Also the Refugees will need to find the "promised Land" you are invited and have been welcomed, nothing is as another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, in view of the continuing flows of refugees and the approaching winter, we have decent conditions for protection seekers.
And it will be an even greater peace, security and stability in Austria to maintain.

For a limited time Notstandards would have to "apply".
That he was, in contrast to the Ministry of the interior for the accommodation of a successful, justified Konrad with his experience.

The power of persuasion was its main weapon.
Konrad and Maier cause of the Republic, no cost, as you said yourself.
The number of employees you want to increase to three to four.
The own Headquarters was not yet successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a Container at the Stephansplatz as an office.

For slightly obese diabetics weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 Diabetes can take according to a new study a minimum of five years.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people live with Diabetes after the weight loss surgery longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data require a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert of weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to shrink to the size of the stomach.
They reduce Hunger and the body to limit its own ability to take in food.
Over the years, obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 have proven to be Diabetes as efficiently, but most of the studies were conducted in people, the morbidly obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
Here you can calculate your BMI: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital the data that you have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 Diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this Operation, declined from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained in those, the non-surgical Diabetes treatments received approximately the same at 29.
Among those who underwent a surgical procedure, dissolved in 36 % of the Diabetes disease completely, and 28 % partially.
In the medically-treated group disbanded in comparison, the Diabetes is complete only in the case of a percent, and partially in only about two percent.
In addition, the results were at the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL-cholesterol ", in General, better in the 'surgical' group," found the authors.
The researchers monitored the patients ' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar values in the course of time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - not decreased as reflected in the improvement in hemoglobin A1c level - the mortality rate in five years, according to the lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year of the Bypass surgery group had lost compared to the gastrectomy group, more weight (to 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved larger decreases in BMI (7,4 against 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3,1 % vs. 2.1 %) and experienced more of a complete Overcoming of the Diabetes (46,9 % vs. 16.7 percent).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that Operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study was in obese people undergoing bariatric surgery to die is about 29 percent less likely to be in the course of 15 years, compared to a group, the more conventional methods tried.
Although the new study showed no advantage for the Survival in the surgery patients, said Blackstone, it should be reassuring for those with a BMI under 35, who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this Operation group is in this lower BMI-lower", without the increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their Doctors should start to take weight seriously, as soon as the Patient lies with his BMI of between 27 and 30.
"I think that we wait too long, until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once you have accumulated these genetic Changes, which have associated their body with obesity and Diabetes, is a reversal of really hard."

"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria praised efforts in coping with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
To take care of "several thousand refugees, is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long-term solutions, like a real peace and real development, can mainly be through education, for these Muslim countries," he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how the killing in their own countries is reduced.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.

According to the 11. September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him the way to the solution of this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and this has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase of ingestion of hand sanitizer by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the U.S., reports an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve, the strong alcoholic hand disinfection swallow, the Georgia Poison Center.

"Children are becoming increasingly more common to these products, and, unfortunately a percent of the lands set by you in the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a dare in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people disinfectant drink only because of a shoddy experience.
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectant with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectant.
"A child thinks that this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (Hand-sanitizer) are the ones that are perfumed.
There is a disinfectant with strawberry, grape and orange fragrance, are great for kids, very appealing.
Hand sanitizer contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent, alcohol.
Particularly in the case of small children, a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical Director of the poison centre at the hospital of the University of Kansas, the TV station Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you would let no SIP of Whisky standing around, but people let this Hand-sanitizer out of the reach of children, and if children come, then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splashes of strawberry scented hand sanitizer in the school, was brought in to the emergency room for treatment.
Your blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that applies in the case of an adult legally considered drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated you in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah slurred her words and was not able to go, as you in the emergency room arrived.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain Trauma, as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and the head had pushed, said Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, told CNN.
It could be for my child to be fatal.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products, or disinfectant wipes and store hand sanitizer out of the reach of the child.
About alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with death in some cases.
In 2013 two women have died in Ontario women after the Swallowing of Hands disinfectants, which contained a toxic and undeclared ingredient.
Employees of the health authorities suspect that the product of Methanol contained a lethal solution instead of ethyl alcohol listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three pupils of the fourth class in the state of New York, planned to poison their "mean" teacher, by laying antibacterial products around the classroom", so it reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer, and she exiled from your room.
The police looked at the foiled Plan as "chatter" and referred to the disciplinary action to the Board of education.

Why I have to witness an execution in Oklahoma will be
A little later today, except in the case of a late legal Intervention, I can see how a man to death.
If it happens, and I hope it happens, I'm going to sit in a spectators gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at the time of his death.
The invitation was made already, for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day grew closer, I began to fear me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed, because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery, to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Anyone who is selected, observe it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossips a confined friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I can't be a witness and a Journalist, so it will not be allowed, a notebook and a pen with me to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the Details.
A Journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
They tell the story of the detainee, as he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
You admitted that you "could have done better formulate", but she still thinks that it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a Problem with some of the things I have said and written.
He says to me, what I write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.
I told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international Reporter is present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that the Publicity of this movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please stop the series of Podcasts, which I have made.
I do not want to go back to all the Details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the fact.
But I think that there is a strong likelihood that he is guilty of murder.
I certainly don't think there is enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm going to see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters, to which you can apply.
What you will get from me, is what it means to see a man in an unnecessary death.

Peter Moody claimed that Stewards were trying to spy on him and threatens to quit the racing
Peter Moody claimed that the Stewards of Racing have tried to Victoria, to install in the past year, a spy in his stables, and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the integrity Department of Racing Victoria, and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratch of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and that he had himself found, under difficult conditions, as it went to the positive cobalt-swab sample at Lidaris, he can't explain.
He had held for 18 months because of the spying allegations back and didn't want it to "look like high-hanging grapes."
"I had nothing to say, and I have long been sitting on it, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know, it was on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going to go home tonight and sleep well.
I would like to walk around head held high, and I want my owners think that I will try my Best for you.
To not think when you start, I do, then I should no longer be coach.
I must then consider what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody's had the bomb in an Interview with racing.com high-that the integrity had been trying to Department, his Stall spy on.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat name in a room with a man - I will, if I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables, to provide information about what I'm doing in my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
You seem to believe that I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, you should be certainly on your nose, because you have failed in the attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former. The Chairman of RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of RVL, were at the time aware of and are now.
Should bring me to the view that it is personally?
Has Fig the RVL and perhaps people outside of the coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry?
I'm bad for the industry?
I'm so bad for the industry?
Maybe people think out there, that I am.
Maybe you need to take me for my license and me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying, can you now think about it.
But I'm now at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
It makes me really sad.
I'm going to put the pressure on you and push you to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The Frustration levels of the Trainers have built with the long-lasting cobalt-investigation, Lidari, and the Late Scratching led to the fact that he said that he "could throw his license on the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar has been described by the race day-treatment rule, "ridiculous", after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which was contrary to the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for it," he said.
"One of my staff has erroneously applied the way the mud on the leg.
It would have been yesterday evening.
It could have been yesterday all day so, what was so.
It had been there but even so, on the day of the race.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the pack on race day. An inquiry into the matter was opened.
It is a joke.
People who establish these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you went too far," said Moody.

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back against rivals because of statements to the ring to fight
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has referred to criticisms of the Tackling his players as "Agenda-Setting" of the two Premier League favourites for the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees fighting the Storm players "ring in" with his Team during the high Storm-victory in the Qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a veiled remark to the Storm Team, after his team had scored the Final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "Prime example" of Rugby League and not "said, that the two from Queensland were too good" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said that they were focused on Tackling only on your "contact us".
Bellamy added that the criticism from two of the leading trainers of his team him with confidence, because it meant that you were concerned to be from the Storm Team hit.
"That appears again and again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson spoke of fights on the ring, as you have us, 24:2 hit," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have changed throughout the year in our defensive System, or the techniques. But in the last six weeks we have made our contact in the Tackles, to a real focus, and that has provided a turning point for us in the trend.
Trent is now for three years there, and he obviously has to train a great team. He is not lose, therefore, likely to be accustomed to, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny to show up like this again and again this Season.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and his Mentor, recalled that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010, with "boring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night, and how exciting your game," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George as a boring Team has been criticized, and Wayne said that he was going to take care of a fuck.
But now he has a Team that can play and that is what we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play, if you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - each Team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that you can play.
I build stronger confidence, because you say these things, because they are a bit worried to play against us play.
Six weeks ago, you have not thought well of us, when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also noted that the game Storm scored against the Roosters a higher result than the game Broncos against the Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two further Attempts in our game, but it is an exciting game?
Or make breaks, and no points to anything Exciting?
For me, the game plans are.
If you mention us, it means that we are in a Phase to you.
The Storm Team has released this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys and the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening in the Vorfinale at AAMI Park. The ticket sale starts next Tuesday morning.

JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meter cell are unworthy of
The Federal constitutional court has given an Ex-detainee of the prison at Tegel right, the months in a small cell was located.
Because of the violation of their human prisoners would, in principle, be entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells.
The decision of the Federal constitutional court in a decision published on Wednesday.
The Affected can hope the judges that even then the money, if they were only imprisoned a few days in the confined space (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
In order for an Ex-detainee was with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe successful: He was in the prison Berlin prison housed-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a single cell, with approximately five square feet of floor space; the lavatory was not separated.
After that, the man who is, according to his lawyer, is now on the loose, had been laid in a larger cell.
His public liability claim due to the inhuman conditions of his detention against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional court cancelled the judgment of the chamber court of Berlin and rejected the case for re-examination there.
You see, the people of the man would be hurt.

Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's coming to Germany?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will continue to come according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the interior this year, according to Germany, according to a statement from Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is Germany even able to a Million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated in the face of unusual challenge and determination: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do this".
What will happen to Germany, gives the following Overview.
Be used according to different forecasts between 350000 (as estimated by the Federal construction Ministry) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel-Institute) flats a year and the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as in the past, is built (250000 dwellings).
Dramatically, the lack of housing but especially in affordable rental properties: Year 60000 to 80000 falling out of social housing from Rent control, and particularly affordable housing will also apply to refugees.
Federal tree inisterin Barbara Hendricks (SPD) is planning to double the funding currently 518 million to a billion euros.
Much too little from the point of view of the Pestel-Institute: 80 000 social dwellings a year would need to occur and for the Federal government to invest should have a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion per year.
Agree scientists, and Federal tree inisterin are therein, that there should also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for labour market and occupational research, it is assumed that in the long term, 55 percent of the Refugees in Germany, can be employed.
However, the refugees in Germany were not asked systematically according to their qualifications, to help you get started, writes Claudia Walter, project Manager for Integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the Integration of refugees is crucial, whether you find a job in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany it has given, according to Thränhardt a political turn: from the ban on employment for refugees for the recognition of work.
While there used to be a labour ban for asylum seekers for up to five years, this was reduced in February 2014 to three months, as well as the duty of residence, the asylum seeker to a place of residence restricted.
In the company of has - also due to the shortage of skilled workers - the majority of the view that refugees should be faster the access to the labour market.
A big hurdle for the access to the labour market lack of knowledge of the German language.
So far, there is not yet a sufficient supply of General and professional language courses.
Studies also show that the jobs to be taught most frequently through personal contacts.
The establishment of networks is therefore of the view that by Thränhardt, the Royal road to integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees parents give their children in the kindergartens, an estimated ten to 15 per cent: "For the uprooted parents, it is first of all important to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesman for the youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
The family still convince of the benefits of the nursery, and distributes the management handouts in different languages.
The demand for teachers should rise as a result of the large number of refugees that would try the Berlin Senate to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing more trade and technical schools.
In the countries the students will be prepared without knowledge of the German language in the Welcome class to the lesson.
But they are not always aware of fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also from teachers, with only a qualification in English as a second language.
In them no defect, Beate Stoffers from Berlin's school administration says.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk is estimated that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no state of asylum seekers says or Tolerated the study - the only exception so far was Berlin, the Senator for the interior Frank Henkel (CDU) has abandoned its stance.
Studi willing refugees could be facilitated the access to higher education.
For refugees with a residence permit or toleration not receive benefits under the asylum seekers benefits act more, if you begin a course of study.
The latter do not get basically no student loans, as they fall under the circle of the bafög-entitled persons.
Tolerated refugees had to have four years in Germany lived to be Bafög-entitled from 1. January 2016, this margin is reduced to 15 months.
Also, this funding gap needs to be closed, ask Steffen noise, Berlin state Secretary for science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should immediately get Bafög.
Islam will in the future play a more important role, because many of the refugees are Muslims, and for many Religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should allow Islam to take over, with the same rights as you have, the churches, and the existing state-churches-to develop a new state-religions relationship.
Also important is the establishment of an Islamic would be welfare Association to take care of professionally to the newcomers.
To the Right also duties.
The representatives of Islam must agree on a clear point of contact and be ready with the state in many areas to cooperate and give him a certain amount of control to give options.
This also includes the willingness to courageously against religious fundamentalism.
The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed on Thursday concern that religious conflicts could also be to Germany.
Those who wanted to play such conflicts in Germany, "to have immediately forfeited your right to dwell here, in Germany," he said on Bavarian radio.
He suggested to translate the basic law in Arabic.
Integration in the future will be much more even than it is today, a subject of the society as a whole.
This will also need to change the majority society, is the removal of discrimination and racism are becoming more pressing.
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since less than a decade, anti-discrimination, and a General equality act.
But it learns very slowly, such as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and the authorities, the racist motive is systematically ignored.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and interest groups, non-white German long challenge and what international agreements such as the anti-racism Convention in Germany to undertake, must be in the next few years, if the country remain peaceful, and its new citizens to use their opportunities for the benefit of all.
Generally speaking, Germany was able to supply the previously expected refugees medically, says doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"What Man - Power and capacity is concerned, we create it," he told the daily mirror.
However, this extra money must flow into the System.
To avoid bottlenecks, calls Montgomery, to all comers at the time of registration, health cards.
Services provided could later be the States of settled.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable that so many people with the limited catalog of FOB off by the asylum seekers benefits act provides.
Otherwise, especially with the language barriers with the Doctors to create.
In the past, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown, migrants are informed worse about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, in doctor's offices, interpreters would have to be over the costs of calls for you.
Many of the refugees would be helped, but also with more General medical calls in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic views.
Among refugee children, there is significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people to HIV awareness.
With some of the other disease pictures of German Doctors come from their training but clear, says Montgomery.
"Parasitic infestations or tuberculosis, are not so difficult to recognize". And as for the shortage of Doctors, the refugees, perhaps even relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees were even Doctors.
To be able to practise, you must demonstrate your qualifications, and may again take exams.
At least half of the in Germany, incoming refugees, according to estimates by the Federal chamber of psychotherapists (BPtK) mentally ill: most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Particularly vulnerable refugee children, Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK explained.
A recently published study of the TU Munich shows that one in every five Syrian refugee child traumatized in Germany arrives.
Who is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, suffers from, among other things, to the so-called Flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart palpitations, and death anxiety.
Other symptoms of sleep - and concentration disorders, severe irritability and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent that the symptoms would chronic, early treatment is necessary, said Munz.
So far, only four percent of mentally ill refugees, however, receive psychotherapy.
Although the mentally ill, asylum-seekers can ask at the end of in the social services, a request for a psychotherapy, but the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, would decide in the social services, mostly clerks or Doctors that are not trained for mental illness, whether treatment was necessary or not.
This often leads to misperceptions, says Munz.

FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that team-mates must stand before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger told Wilshere, that it was only September, and if his Rehabilitation goes according to Plan, there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his involvement in next summer at the European championship is certainly still uncertain.
The great shame in this current Problem is that Wilshere had finished the last season, according to a separate ankle injury and then found back to his old swing during the preseason had to go back.
"This type of injury is not a threat to career," said Wenger.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
This may be from a purely medical point of view, true, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the associated danger of further injury, when a player is trying, in the middle of the season to return.
It is also an unpleasant pattern developing.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 of different diseases of Wilshere, since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal 157 League games in the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of the eight seasons since 2007/08, one of the two Premier League Clubs that have suffered the most injury to-day.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time in which you strengthen your body and combat power to win," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body has stabilized, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the Play against Chelsea on Saturday against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is a Rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu is likely to start Debuchy and Arteta.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and the players need to take a little breather," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites, through group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play areas with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is unbeaten after 41 Games, after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was rocked on Tuesday evening by an earthquake, with the Richter scale, and 3.2 were measured.
This year it was the 10. in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season of the Champions League capitulation against Monaco, and the remains of the distant hope, driven to lead with his Management of the club its first European Cup Triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It worked at Arsenal.
We were in the year 2006 very close to it, but on the other hand, I'm long enough in the business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
Friends: the Comedy Show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The Absence of similar representations in Shows is obvious, particularly in view of the fact, such as the need for men to open up, is now become more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year High prove.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it is three Times more common in men than in women.
In an Effort to address the Problem, announced the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a pathetic life) 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim to make the culture in question, which prevent men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the battle, to master this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 High School students with depressive symptoms found that, if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, cut in half, a circle of mentally healthy friends, the risks of mental problems.
But of course you must have friends, a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communications, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need for a strong, fun-loving, and to appear successful, even if in reality, the Isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what is what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, Image, social Status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - it is our inner longing for personal development and friendship, on our mental health a lot of in-depth impact.
And like a video game inventor and billionaire, said recently, money happiness can't buy really.
The Nice thing about Friends was that this focus was also placed on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work but by his personality, which shone through the interaction of as a friend.
The Humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments when watching Football in the cozy armchairs, and the longing of Ross and Rachel - all of which came from the Knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even if you keep often back, to fully explore their feelings.
As an employee of the Telefonseelsorge it to me said:... "my listener role for people who feel depressed and suicidal are at risk, has shown me really clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men that contact us, do not often feel able to talk with friends.
The old phrase, "I can handle it" has come a tremendous effect, like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness, if to speak about problems openly."
Friends is one of the Shows that comes to my mind when I try, the longer-term coping mechanisms.
You presented very clearly the little moments of male bonding.
So my objective outsider Status over the phone the people in the eyes of despair look like to help support the long term comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, when you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friends with to celebrate the day in a completely new designed scenery, why not take your friends for a Drink in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see in Starbucks, someone sitting around alone, give him a Smile and say Hello.
You never know what a difference it could make their friendship.
Friends will be sent on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the whole of the 236 episodes of #Friends
Di Maria hits, to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal against Malmö.
Di Maria hits on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG, Malmö is the place to pull.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were, of course, Paris Saint-Germain started the Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria struck less than four minutes after the Start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player, brought the French champion on the way, but then they missed a number of opportunities, before they increased their lead when Cavani in the 61. Minute, a headed goal to open the scoring.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in group A, Paris needed a strong Start against the Swedish Champions as they strive for qualification for the knockout rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's Team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown Team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career already in the year of 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good Start, to win 2:0, to cause our opponents problems and relaxed look back, even if there are certain things that we need to perfect in the course of the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three Changes in the Paris Team, which was able to hold on the weekend was a 2:2 draw on home ground against Bordeaux in the League, but he was upstaged in the fourth Minute through Di Maria.
The Argentine winger has been referred to as the man, the PSG can take to the next level in Europe, as he was taken in the last month from Manchester United, and he suggested, why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis Pass in behind the Malmo defence, before he graduated to Johan Wiland over beautifully into the far corner of the net.
However, if someone believed that PSG would score a great victory, was disappointed.
Malmo, Celtic beat them in a Play-off to reach this level, competed in Anpiff with nine players on the field and was a Five-man defence and two lined up deep in the midfield, a difficult opponent.
But apart from a shot from Thorsten kinhofer, far to Kevin Trapps post in the 34. A Minute went by, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG themselves were sometimes, with some misplaced passes and poor financial statements, not the least of Ibrahimovic, who bombed with no less than five attempts in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he showed a lot more skill, when he brought his teammates into the game, and it's a Pass from Ibrahimovic, Di Maria turned in a turn and shot, which is of Wiland in the 52. A Minute was drawn past the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had a left-wing cross from Maxwell up fishing.
That ended all thoughts of the fact that Malmo could get back into the game, and only an excellent Intervention from Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz, was able to keep the final score low, before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his Team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have not only played in the Swedish League, which has the same level.
The qualification games are not enough."
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game from you!

Klaus Alte post has written the introduction, and Bible texts updated.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which is now published with beautiful images.
At the beginning of the image for Otmar Alt, formulated in 150 motifs in his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
Its "language" with bright colors and fanciful shapes has received the 75-Year-old, but they are by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary, The respective subjects adapted to the quite grim.
About three years, Otmar has worked Old on his Bible project, for which he has a subjective, artistic choice from the many topics of the "book of all books".
Created cycles dedicated to various topics, such as the stations of the cross, Plagues, commandments or our father.
So he has fascinated several partners: the Lutheran publishing house, with its theological orientation, as well as for the Kettler-Verlag, with its emphasis on art books.
And mainly because of the author Klaus Alte post, which has, on the basis of the painting with the respective passages in the Bible apart.
He has interpreted the Otmar Alt selected Bible passages and so to Today, in current contexts "translated".
These lyrics are like a verbal mirror of Alts painting.
Are nestled between the Original Bible quote of Martin Luther and each of a set of the artist who formulated his own personal thoughts on the Situation.

The 75 allowed-Year-old twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were at all a trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode born and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Moravian Church-order.
"Since the education happened with the cane," remembers Otmar Alt.
"I tried to work through this, to tolerate me, perhaps, that with the Lord father."
His second concern was to help the art in fast-paced time more important: "The perception of image worlds today is influenced by advertising, and is loud.
Symbolism is displaced.
Artists have to show a desire and delight, of things.
Images always have a bit of a Mystery and are not decorative.
"In this regard, I'm a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt would like the viewer in the images "fall into it", you, discover and feel the power you have: "looking at The picture be compared To".
Klaus old post confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "to have always been" a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like the way he conceives of his paintings to life".
Old did not pay attention to the Bible is complete, but the important to him, even mysterious topics selected.
"That wasn't a cooperation at eye level", says old post: "Here are the pictures, the Text explains only". A pictures of Bible.
For Hans Möhler from the Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation, "to deepen his life and to find freedom".
Otmar Alts pictures speak for moehler in both the (biblical) language of love as well as responsibility.
A part of the original paper and canvas images will be presented for the first time in an exhibition at the 15. November will be opened in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.

For the testing of new technology, a test is currently being built distance on the highway 9 in Bavaria.
The rider of the "no additional liability risks to be saddled with" wants to check the Federal government the legal framework ", and, where necessary, to the new developments to adapt".
So to use Germany, for example, at international level, the maximum allowable speed for self-driving will be raised at the end of cars from 10 to 130 kilometres an hour.
The Federal government wants to call for an Amendment to the Vienna Convention, which provides, so far, only the people as a driver.

The technology is based on Sensors and cameras that capture the environment and the data in a matter of seconds to process.
According to the Ministry of economy submitted to the study, highly automated Driving on motorways by 2020 is technically possible.
Nevertheless, the driver can be expected lots of vehicles on public roads "after 2020".

Well, every Fourth would leave the car in control under any circumstances.

You wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who was, among other things, with Madonna's stage outfits to the big Star of the fashion scene and that he put men in skirts.
"I can say today that I am the Enfant terrible of Haute Couture, because I have white hair."
"Before, it was bleached and now it's real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), the of 18. September is to be seen in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial negative attitude to a Look about his Person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition of sound a bit like death," he said.
If you die, you come to the Museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in the canadian city of Montreal and in Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than beautiful dresses," said the Director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is a matter of tolerance, acceptance and the Vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the has hardly written overview at the end of the work of the man, the history of fashion, without ever training completed.
Chronologically, the Exhibition is not constructed, but it is a superbly choreographed a total work of art, for the lots of effort was put: to style the dolls, was hired for example, a dedicated Stylist.
14 tons of Material have been carted off to the creators, according to the curator, Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the Start of the Oktoberfest, a special treat was yet to come: a Lederhosen Outfit with a corset.

He is the first, timid fashionable steps of the designer.
As a child (he is not a good student, and bad at football) he has attracted to his Teddy, Bras and dresses, said Gaultier.
To play with a doll, they would not have allowed his parents to him.
The Design of fashion he had taught later on.
He stole fashion magazines and the designs of other designers, such as Gaultier told me in Munich.
Later I bought the then but of course.

You got nothing, but had to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of a Curtain - Plauener lace as a fashion niche
Earlier it went to the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace created in large quantity for customers, which Cover, for example, and curtains that have been further processed.
This alone no longer works today, said Andreas Reinhardt, managing Director of the fashion tip in Plauen.
Instead, the Mode is again important.
In the early days of the Plauen lace fashion played a larger role, and was then supplanted by the home textile industry and is now being discovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions a few examples: top in jewelry, accessories such as bags and in regional Costumes.
Even the so-called Vintage-fashion-inspired eras of past style the picture, this is a growing job potential.
Who operated in the textile industry in Germany, no niches, no longer on the market.
With us, you already make up half of all jobs.
Fashion tip member is Plauen, together with nine other companies in the industry Association Plauener lace and embroidery.
Only you are allowed to carry the protected Label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of the sales were broken.
Private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade it is almost.
Our products reach the customer in this way.
The bulk goods are nowadays produced in Asia, much cheaper and almost exclusively on chains sold.
In addition, the Export schwächle, currently Russia and the USA.
Enough reasons, therefore, for new ways.
The industry Association is trying to score points through environmental awareness, such as Cordula Bauer of the stick pearl explains in Falkenstein: "Since this year we carry a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and in a socially responsible manner".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Diplom designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger foreign office of West Saxon University of Zwickau - in the faculty of applied arts, and is specialized in embroidery and lace.
Of the competition from the Asian region to oppose something, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think, especially economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing Design will varies often only slightly, in order to keep a customer base.
Several years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historical snow ball top.
The machine embroiders in some Places, small beads.
The Plauener gold champion Bianca hall Bach wrought-Krauße was inspired by them: "Before, I could start with the traditional Plauener Spitze nothing".
Now, you used the snow-ball top for your jewelry.
In a complex process shaping the pattern in silver.
"A lot of people in the Region identify with the theme of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also provides in the United States, Australia, and Finland - and especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want to have a piece of memorabilia.
So I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of Plauener Spitze.

EU wants to double the mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish and the consumers to a much higher dose of the Neurotoxin expect.
The consumer organization food watch, of a corresponding working paper of the EU, criticised the plans, sharp: "the risks and side effects of misguided industrial policy and environmental policy are passed on with full force on Pregnant women and small children," said Matthias wolf Schmidt of food watch.
Wolf Schmidt, according to the limits of the nerve poison for big fish at the end of the food chain such as shark or fish, "the economy of the sword for political reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish raised.
Large predatory fish are loaded already so strongly with mercury, that on the basis of the current limits is about 50 per cent of the catch not sold.
After the doubling of the limits, only 14.5 per cent would then be unsellable.
In return for this easing, the EU wants to tighten, according to foodwatch, the limits for other fish of currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Food watch has described this as a "Trick", because small fried fish, such as carp are mostly charged so low that you fail to comply with the proposed maximum values.
The reduction in small fish, therefore, was "a perfidious distraction, that alone can help the economy," said wolf Schmidt.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal that accumulates through the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal government therefore warns against that "even small amounts can cause in Unborn damage to the nervous system".
The Federal Ministry of the environment explained on its website in respect of the applicable maximum values, however, that a "risk to health of the General population" was not to be expected.
Mercury enters mainly through the combustion of coal in the environment.
The German coal-fired power stations emit according to a written information of the Federal Ministry of the environment, the Green of the Bundestag, Anna Lena Baerbock more than six tonnes of mercury in the year, two-thirds of in Germany emitted a total amount.
The concentration of mercury in fish in the Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube had exceeded the "permanently and extensively", had quoted the "mirror" in March, out of the paper.
In the past year, Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish is already the most commonly reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
