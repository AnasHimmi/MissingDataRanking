He said that Lamb made verhängnisvollen emergency sometime after that.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamm einkesselte life, as the police took him.
A day after the shootout in the university students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as the aussagten what students and staff who knew him, that helped zeichnen a picture of a teacher talentierten but potentially difficult.
Students said they were happy to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said that he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb akademisches geschriebenen in one of his book, in which he mentioned the "beautiful people" with whom he shared his life.

The latest changes in the employment of the University bedeuteten would be no guarantee that the promotion for the Lamb had worked so hard for him to an automatic path to a job as Assistant Professor.
Universitäts President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course, there was something in Mr Lambs idea."
These are questions that can no longer answer Lamb.
After the escape from the campus police later found Lambs track as he einfuhr again in Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested Lamb killed selbstmit a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green ville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.

She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool guy who was a few years older, beizubringen the Gitarren game.
He was then the women Schwarm.
All the girls schmolzen then, if he was there, "said hair tone, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon in prison.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.
In an emergency Lamb said: "I've killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
You had a dog named Light Ning, who lived with them in the baking stone house, located on a Bayou in Gautier angrenzt.
The police said that the dog was in order.
Prentiss's former husband, Shawn O 'Steen geschieden were told they were 15 years ago, but have remained friends and had a daughter, who was 19 years old now.
"It was totally destroyed on the ground," O 'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
Steen said he never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail, he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss, as both he and Abigail three years ago on a summer Jahrmarkt auftraten.
Later they played together one or other of the Gig.
Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for different companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a Barkeeper and sometimes Unterhaltungs coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of 5 September for the last time after Lamb Gitarren- and mouth Harmonika game ended in front of a sparse audience had ended.
There were no signs that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were on Aufräumen and scherzten.
I think they both had a good sense of omnipotence.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar programme and specialising in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee.

Schmidts wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace during".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We are trying to encourage our students to return," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.

8 poll figures, which show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some brands have tried to fire him as Flop.
Others have dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter, as some Republicans are trying to draw from the upper echelons in polls down Donald Trump, it has not (yet) works.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double digit range, and some are beginning to seriously ask themselves, what it means for the chances of the nomination of real estate Moguls.
Of course, it is still too early in the term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that has been made at this time in the year 2011 Rick Perrys led to rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won only one state in the nominating process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps by holding assets and begin to make their dollars go to overthrow him.
Here are some current poll ratings suggest that the real estate Mogul is not just a temporary phase.
Trumps popularity ratings have rotated 180 degrees.
Shortly before the Real Estate Mogul Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw positive.
Until the middle of July, there were 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, there were 52 percent.
Six in 10 Republicans now have a positive opinion of Donald Trump.
About three in ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And those numbers keep in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP electorate GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a poll by CNN / ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "enthusiastic" or "pleased" if Trump were nominated.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent say the same about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters that they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment would say to the candidate.
A majority of Republicans see Trumps temperament is not a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticised for its BOMBA tables and beleidigenden statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tendiere to the Republicans believe that the Estate Mogul have the right temperament for a president, ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same number is the first state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same prefix 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a Oberbefehlshaber according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent think that they do not have the personality to run his office effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament is not passe to the White House, ABC / Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
If they put their scholars hats, Trump Republican voters believe to be real.
When they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a poll by CNN / ORC, say four out of ten from the last week that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters had not the klarste Kristall ball in the past.
At this time last cycle to four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination only 28% for the final candidates, Mitt Romney.
However, Trumps campaign shows that a large number of GOP voters see as plausible.
Even if the Republicans collected another candidate, Trump beats almost every.
Some experts point out that the zersplitterte field likely contributes to Trumps leadership, while the support Trump is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
A Monmouth University poll in early September, however, shows that the majority of support in a head to head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump hypothetischen reap.
He has 33 points ahead of Carly Fiorina 13 points ahead, with 14 points, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It is a head to head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the hypothetischen entrepreneurs with 19 points in a head to head race.
A knappe majority of Donald Trump fans says that they have formed their opinion.
A new poll by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Trump, say that they have given their votes.
Much can be done to change that, and no one can really say, of course, to never change the opinion.
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Yet Trumps strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, the neuro surgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinions are twice as often for Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago called immigrants from Mexico as "rapists" immigration was Dreh- und Angelpunkt in public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that the BOMB Asti che expression of Trump will hold crucial Hispanic Americans out of the Republican Party and will damage the Neuorientierungs effort.
But according to the new ABC / Post poll on Monday that six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as so verbleibt Rampenlicht immigration, it is apparently also do Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government klettert to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson is now roughly half the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.
Six in 10 Republicans say they want a political outsider, rather than someone with experience of government in the new Montags poll by ABC / Post.
And they are also angry at Washington.
A Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, angered by "Howlin" dissatisfied "with 54 percent and 21 percent."

The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut in the Prime Minister's Fragestunde and for the first time with David Cameron anlegen.
MR Corbyn will levy is examined for the first of his six probably set to ask questions shortly after noon, with his performance of the media and the Labour MP from the area.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He has also said that he could überspringen some meetings to leave her colleague.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns leadership because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech on the Tuc Jahrestagung on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour leader, the national anthem at a ceremony on Tuesday during the Singens on anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence 75. verharren, has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and Stories is at the centre of several front pages in the newspapers.
MR Corbyns decision not to sing the national anthem, has drawn attention to himself
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "been in respect of silence" and he had recognised the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England."
But a member of Mr Corbyns shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC News Two night program that he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns top team, and they called on differences in defence and foreign policy, the economy, while less than a Sechstel Parlamentarischen party supported him initially as a leader.
Of the BBC correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences within Labour "Politische stapeln 'after Mr Corbyns statements on the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits.
MR Corbyn said the Tuc conference that Labour vorlege changes in order to remove the whole idea of a reduction in total.

He has also brought the idea into the conversation, that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he had referred to John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from the policy in the style of a "Kasperle Theater" that is often associated with the Prime Minister's Fragestunde. But a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.

Metcash launches campaign to combat Aldi- Bodenständigkeits Einfall
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores before an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food Großhändler Metcash has a Bodenständigkeits campaign launched to defend the market share of the IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia prepared early next year to strengthen its relationship with local food suppliers and IGA Sozialen by marketing and marketing on the mainstream media to build the brand, as well as events such as Metcash and IGA Supermärkte Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Eishersteller Simmo DUNS Borough distributed in IGA stores samples and shop owners verbilligte treue customers sell tickets for the South Australian Football League.
It is expected that if the Großhändler on food, alcohol and equipment conducts its annual investor Strategietag Metcash released more details of its defence strategy on September 29.
There is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA store transactions and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in Oststaaten.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a far greater share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia Oststaaten compared to about 14 percent.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi is twelve months after opening its first markets wegschnappen around five per cent of the grocery market in these two states and all existing players, but mainly selbständigen individual traders wegnehmen sales.
According to a report published this week estimated by Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath, Metcash and IGA retailers $360 million in sales per year could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and WA in 30 next year and $500 million and $600 million in sales in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery business and at amounts based on Metcashs high Fixkosten Metcash could cost around $13 million of earnings before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time loses Metcash Oststaaten Marktanteile, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a survey recently conducted by Roy Morgan found that IGA shoppers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley notes that Metcashs sales will fall in food and grocery business by 3.8 percent in the year 2016, at 4.1 percent in the year 2017 and 2.1 percent in the year 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in the year 2015 to 10,3% by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Doug estate, told the founder of Magellan Financial Group, with a Geschäftsessen in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a Jahrzehnts. Metcash.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments by Mr. Doug estate.
But it is assumed that a member of Metcash has included contact with Mr. Doug approved last week.
IGAS share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcashs food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, which reflects the operational debt reduction in gleichzeitigem pressure on sales and margins.
However, the Großhändler refuses and invested more than $150 million in sales prices anzugleichen hundreds of products each week with Coles and Woolworths, IGA to improve individual traders in the improvement of their stores by faster growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private label foods.
Metcashs Chief Executive Ian Morrice says that the purchase price adjustments and store refurbishment programmes to Elan and hopes that the Großhändler will return to profit growth in the year 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of "Kollateralschäden" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and in the opinion of the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis jüngere talentierten duo that is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks," came through the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters ins Rampenlicht.
In a feurigen qualification game in Cincinnati soon after Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, twice had to be separated by the referee, with Harrison ausrief: "Beat Wawrinka should have Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen, as he was a tennis racquet zerschlug, after a Krampf vereitelte a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis Healy steadfastly defended.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup semifinals against Britain.
"One thing that I was, in my view, is the fact that Thanasi hineingezogen ereifere me quite a bit in the dispute," Healy said.
He has broken a racquet when he lost in the US Open because of a Krampfes, but he is not the first player Thanasi has broken a racquet in frustration with himself, and I know well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behave extremely well in the US Open, even under the circumstances pretty provokativen with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around himself, he has a great family around themselves, and I believe that he was treated a bit too strict.
He is a very mature 19 years, he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in Umkleide areas, he trains hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own Verdiensten ausgereifter.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios in the important decisions, which begins on Friday, and he describes the joint decision as the right one for everyone, but he is the man from Canberra, as long an integral part to return to the team. "
"First, we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not" to all the controversies rundherum [Kyrgios], Healy said.
Schlimme very quickly and I think Nick has managed the rise, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some mistakes and some time outside the Rampen Lichts deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. He can only think about it I think is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best thing for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closing the border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and riegelte the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to come into the country illegally, all with the aim to stop the influx of migrants.
Chaos ensued as hundreds of migrants ansammelten in a no man's land on the border and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled from violence firmly stuck, for an unknown period of time in a strip of land along the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and let themselves down there.
But Frustrationen rose.
As a police helicopter schwebte on them, the migrants "Öffnet!" Chanted the border and schrieen insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some had food and water in protest.
Serbiens Foreign Minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants from Hungary were zurückgeschickt, while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a Kollateralschaden.
It must take place in the coming days, talks with Brussels and other countries, "Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil on the ungarisch Serbian border came a day after the bloc of 28 nations at a contentious meeting in Brussels to agree a common immigration policy.
The ministers agreed, however, to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece überrumpelten. They expressed their hope that after all - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached, the EU states would include another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary,.
Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel and Austria called Sondergipfel of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
Hungary ended his hopes, however, not on a baldige action from Brussels or from its neighbours.
Roads and accelerate Asylverfahren absperren ausgerufene state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they could.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said meanwhile that his country also plan the construction of a barbed wire Zauns along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants from the country - after it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D Wettlauf Agata reported that even inmates at the prison were used to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere is Hungary to become a significant Engpass and the entry point into the European Union in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most Ankommenden war refugees have a right to protection - a view that is sharply at odds with other EU countries, including Germany, are economic refugees who are in search of a better life and not.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary to make the crossing the border or the Beschädigen Zauns 4 meters (13 feet) high, the government had built along the southern border with Serbia, a crime. These laws are also higher prison sentences for convicted Menschenhändler.
"Due to the situation that has arisen through the mass migration, the Hungarian government declared the Notzustand," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal Grenzübergang is a crime.
Parliament must still agree with technical procedures or the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but the Associated Press reporters have already seen on the border of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security consultant for Orban, said that 45 people while trying to cross the border authorities eingedrungen erwischten 15 others were already deeper into the country.
You herüber come by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and the Begehung accused of offences under the new laws.
Authorities are working to repair the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven Grenzübergänge with Serbia, after a Zugwaggon arrived with barbed wire to close the borders, on Tuesday morning.
Chaos hineinzudrängen eröffneten umgab main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, a small office in a metal container as the Hungarians to edit the data of people and put a lot of people are there.
About 20 managed to get it, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in the national poll, halved
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her.
Clinton has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries now) (58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (previously increased by 17 percent.
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's Unterstützer are consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll has Clinton lost on a number of demographic groups, while Sanders posted some gains.
Clinton holds a large lead among women and Gemäßigten, but these Vorsprünge have decreased.
Their support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is here only by 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has verflüchtigt, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month was Clinton, Sanders, with two adjustable lead for the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5 point lead in this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter of them would support with some Vorbehalten and another 15 percent, they would only support because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current Unterstützer are particularly excited by it.
The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter of them would enthusiastically support.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's Unterstützer will be asked in an open question as to why they want that she is the candidate, the most common answer is that it has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time that a woman will be President (13 percent) and that it is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
From Clinton's supporters also mentions her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Approval for dealing with the problems and the wählbar are also cited.
As the vice president raises a potential for the presidency in the Waagschale, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him in the race - even though a third believed that he should not do it.
If Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice party, Biden is at the top.
Far more than half of Clinton's supporters say that Biden would be their second choice Sanders.
Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders, increases of 20 points with Biden in Wettlauf on 30 points without him in the race.
Fünfundfünfzig percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election, but that number has fallen from 78 percent in the last month.
Biden is a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most wählbar" has risen by far.
Still, the question on what is important in a candidate, give Democratic voters questions about the wählbar.
Much like last month, not a single Demokratischer candidate or potential candidate stands out for these voters in the primaries as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates of their party primaries yield good results in some important features for voters.
See Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong Mehrheiten Führungsqualitäten.
Biden schneidet honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead in the best of the three candidates.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic primary voters see Clinton, Sanders and Biden also generally ideologically in line with their views.
With all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters has no opinion of Sanders.
As questions are asked to continue during the tenure as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and one of Servers, Democratic primary voters are the most satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole.
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans is now unhappy with their statement, while only around a third is satisfied.
Public opinion was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans have said that the email controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of her is even worse.
There are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this is still a problem for them under eingetragenen voters as a whole: Only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and less 15 points since May.
62 percent of the electorate do not keep them for an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters nationwide see Trump as not honest and trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump received good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested Biden, Carson and Bush schneiden best with honesty.
A majority sees Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in nationwide survey
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest poll from CBS News / New York Times
On the two candidates now accounts for half of the support of voters in the new poll, and others lose dramatically to stop
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers across the country. The support is growing by 23% in the last CBS poll, which was conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the poll on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is good for demographic groups and surpasses Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the Feldes, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich is Wisconsins governor Scott Walker beat away support in the last month of the deepest has fallen, from 10% to 2% now.
The former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
Marge's error in the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.

The most recent ABC News / Washington Post poll showed Trump clear before Carson.
With a view to a rising in the last week Carson found some side blows for the former neuro surgeons, even after Carson apologized for Trump to question Trumps faith.
"We need energy," Trump said during a campaign appearance in Iowa last Saturday.

Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Baruch College Neulings
Almost two years after a student died during a schikanösen Rituals student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, will be filed murder charges against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a launch Rituals in September 2013 and verzögerten his transport to the hospital, which has contributed to his death, shared with the police.
Officials said he had been charged with associated eyes with a 30 pound backpack full of sand, and marriages have been attacked repeatedly, while he tried to reach a goal on a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity was called the emergency number 911 after Deng ohnmächtig and waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, police said.
You had the time to switch Dengs clothing, googeln his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, however, ask for advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and the Brotherhood's Wohl Michael Deng fundamentally questioned about this," said Police Chief Wagner.
He could not be wiederbelebt, and he died the next morning about his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng has been repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to head, trunk and Oberschenkel.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the bullying of the Brotherhood. Berg, a lawyer who represents at least one student dies every year since 1970 to the harassment," said Douglas Fier Dengs family, in a statement.
Brother properties and its members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended a charge of third degree murder for the first five members.
32 members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged for schikanöser attacks and forming a criminal organisation.
"We not only want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that has - officially sanctioned or inoffiziell - this, so we will also take this to account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked their membership of the local group.
That will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate increase is coming, and the Hausse will get upset that bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know how long that takes and how long it will last.
In particular, the story offers little guidance to the end for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and took 86 months.
The Aggressivität the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, but not always, a factor in how the economy and financial systems respond.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather on the period that is required for the normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, market participants might say, however, that all the excitement was probably exaggerated because of an increase in interest rates.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money "," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the allmähliche US interest rates return to normal levels, but still too low level for Seis mix shock many seem to fear to lead.
This does not, however, mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a look basierender on historical trends, as some areas of the economy might respond:
As the market has seen in the last month, the advance payment can make things of interest rate increases volatil for a while.
As soon as the increase eintrifft, the impact is not so dramatic.
"Apparently, there is a tendency that asset returns are abgewürgt 12 to 24 months after the first hike, which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens to interest rate increases by the Fed.
More specifically, the market is usually in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to raising interest rates, relatively flat in the 250 days after that (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal condition after 500 days, with a durchschnittlichen returns in the past six past Zyklen 14,4 percent according to a recent analysis, Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle of increase and the yield that begins to reduce.
Rezessionen are a fact of business life, but they often promote interest rate increases.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with a number of conditions that did not exist before and which could hasten a recession.
Most remarkable is that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in a rate hike by the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank nominale GDP was at 118 rate increases since 1950 only twice under 4.5 percent.
Although the second was 3.6 percent of 2015, few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate increases in such a fragilen economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants throughout the year to a rate increase by the Fed have been taken, and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many Strategen and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the futures trading is only a 25 percent chance.
"In our study have all increased Zyklen from 1950 to today put in place and pre-recession GDP levels very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shade in a super cycle with increasing momentum," says the report.
In contrast, this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest, the Fed has maintained since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are so far 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatil, because the market is anticipating a rate increase, and quite similar to the pattern as on the capital market.
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than in equities, if the change their strategic course.
With bond yields seem to change direction, once the first increase / decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increasing the bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Strategen by Charles Schwab believes that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds back closer together and lead to Abflachung curve.
High verzinsliche bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious, higher yields to be expected," said Kathy Jones, Fixed Income Analystin at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interesting, Jones says, is that the markets have already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of Inflationserwartungen there are few signs that the market to the prospect of tighter monetary policy has been adjusted," they wrote.
Short term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flacher credit spannen have extended their strategy and the volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightened.
By and large companies that the greater part of their Geschäftstätigkeit abwickeln in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products more attractive.
Multinationale companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market, and also the financing of its debt.
"History shows that" Qualitäts- "shares tend to respond very positively," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report three months after an initial rate increase for customers.
Companies with strong balance übertroffen companies with weak balance after each of interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on average, by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares exceeded their counterparts with lower quality by an average of 4 percentage points (percentage points) and 3 (each).
Debt is a major problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games will benefit consumers by the rising dollar also.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even though experts have different views of how quickly that will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative member of Parliament criticised the broadcaster for its "Verdummung"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also zielte The Brits on the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitierten
House colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice, and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "converts" to Classic FM, a leading member of Parliament and increased pressure on the broadcaster claims to prove that he is doing something new, which do not do the private broadcasters.
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham told the BBC that public legal Radiosender Bossen verdumme "" and is increasingly unable to distinguish from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - benutze I do not like the word" verdummen "- but it seems to turn to Classic FM," he said.
He also zielte on the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, seem to be The Brits only under a different name.
So, if you are trying to do something different - these are two examples where you actually mimic "spontaneously called only what is already on the market, Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director General dismissed the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and information to the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, which I will learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and Musizieren unübertroffen really is.
"And to find new music and new works in order to give the commitment of Radio 3, think I is also really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that needs to be worked harder to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
BBC Radio 3 was not the only element of the production, which came under fire during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture, media and sport for commercial rivals to get on their feet.
The Tory MP Damien Collins attacked - the BBC's musical talent show The Voice, which was bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for geschätzte costs of £22 million.
You see, why this program is often discussed, because it is not original, and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - was produced as a judge - "in a special BBC way" with Paloma Faith and Boy George.
He added that he wish that the company consider "a hit from our own stall," when the next time it starte entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out the appointment of another series of The Voice in the future or spending fee payers money on other Unterhaltungs formats.

"I am a legal representative?," he asked.
The official also said that he had never received a penny in salary, money and Diäten charged he had only kilometres.
At Diäten 1,000 euros per month into account, the actual cost was much higher, however, he asked the club, he added.

He was treated on the field nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
It will be published tomorrow, or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 Manchester United has, it is very hard and then fantastic, and then this happens.

He weinte.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he will not play in the group stage.

Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It is a very schlimme violation."
If a player leaves the room with this type of injury, are all very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.

David Cameron The Lorax certainly knows better?
There is one thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will be not long before you know it almost auswendig.
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems, the prime minister decided to name his favourite children's book, The Lorax, published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron super camps in a message on the company's website, and has continued: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I vorlese like my children, because it always seems a picture or to give a message that we have missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book instead of a film version of 2012 wiedergibt Inhaltsangabe new characters and details added to expand the relatively short Originaltext.
"In the midst of the city ummauerten Thneed Ville where all of nature is gone, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, in their desire to see a real tree, fulfilled," reads one. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that were not suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part as the summary of the Lorax movie, which will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins: "In the city ummauerten Thneed Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he zugibt pragmatischer a father to be here, it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the plot of the book so little. Hears cases of an unnamed boy, such as the local environment by the greed of money and trees, despite the protests of the name Lorax Thneed Strick Once-ler, a Hock end schnurrbärtigen beings, "that speaks on behalf of the trees," is devastated.
Most likely was such a relatively low PR task a helper delegiert who has read The Lorax 20 times in a row, not a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text was likely to come by Camerons constituency office.
Super camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Camerons employees, but gave no further unmittelbaren comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from the England team, but it is still hard
Has selected in England's squad for the trip to face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but if one sees is not a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat on my card.
I would not rule out an away victory.
Alastair Cooks side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good Spin players in the Batting list and the community spirit is strong; they will not bear scars of 2012, only a young and positive attitude.
Moeen Ali as Spin Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, developed with the ball is an option for the attack.
Related news: Adam Lyth scheidet from the England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to let Adam Lyth is difficult for me to analyse as his head coach in Yorkshire, of course,.
There were two good attacks in difficult conditions in his seven Tests, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There was no question mark there with Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination - and I said this vorhin - players are their own best chooser.
A long time ago, it would have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control of his own destiny.
If he beats out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire, comes another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he was not so good services rendered, and it does not surprise me; he is a team man.
The question of how much time a test shot man gets to put his characters is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances, as Sam Robson got in front of him, while Nick Compton nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play Heim- and abroad.
The only accusation you can levy was that England was first used in the Caribbean - Jonathan Trott as Lyth in peak form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a hit man I einschätze high.
He is an X factor Cricket players, what we saw in Yorkshire early in this season, when he scored against us at Trent Bridge pitch 236, which made us very.
He must receive at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but that of course depends on the team to a position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen beat next to Cook to leave, which would provide an Extra Spin Bowler and received four Quicks, appeared on, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why can't beat a man there, and this left-handed has already shown that he is a devil guy from Cricket players.
Moeen has perhaps not done its job for Worcester County hire, but he is a number 3 for them, and because there is no big difference.
My former team mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at first drop, before he appeared in 2001 as Opener.
He has now made three hundred runs and has not looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as Back Up Spinner and, in my limited dealings with him, he impressed me as a young man.
People may see his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a Punt, but there are a large number of Backup Spinnern raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the England team has made a few clever Ergänzungen in the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the game's most nette guys mitbringen a wealth of experience, as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball part of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the Setup.
I always felt that he created for the International Cricket competition is as a player or as a coach and as Mahela has Einsichten, from which we can benefit from it.
Sometimes new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the cabin Umkleide, even if the messages are consistent with what has previously been said.
Collys team colleague in Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used in the One Dayers Root received a similar break against Australia and, for my part, I have no problem with that.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and team on the plate does not determine the timetable.
And you must bear in mind that their jobs depend, as with the players from the results.
Such decisions are not taken with a light heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = Britain's exit from the EU) to recruits could win if the economy by the year 2017 gets into a slump
David Camerons genialen crude Neuverhandlungs strategy, in order to keep Britain in the EU, with each day deeper in trouble, even without the election of Jeremy Corbyn to the Labour leader "is it yes or no?" Or the Tuc for Europe on Tuesday sharply zerst ride.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend said recently that some member states, so deeply enmeshed in various crises, such as the EU is now and not always from their own fault, even created Britain's agenda with divided Zugeständnissen and malfunction Vertragsänderungen that they usually are not satisfied.
In Brighton, the Tuc decided at its annual meeting that it may not even if they threaten the social protection.
We could call it even Dave and Georges Selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister to climb to summit or bilaterale meetings in foreign capitals, a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument, with or without local economies, then come home and say that they win allies for reform.
It is always about me.
Look through my European friend who wants an outside view of Britain inside the EU Zeltes - "Lass leaves us not only with France," says Berlin - and that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some cities have come to the point where it is no matter to them, whether we stay or go.
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel cautiously prudent is an ally, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them as Aush Arre as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16 is done with excessively long).
France's François Hollande looks back on his reelection or his replacement in the year 2017.
He is also a verb declining force.
Poland has probably soon left nationalistische right government, Spain.
It is hard to imagine that it is a leg ausreißen should be used to help the Selfie Britons, whose energy is better for Scotland's exit from the UK - something they may not want to avoid, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore may be planning some sort of minister even deliberately not hilfreiche points, all in the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017, to speed up the process of Brexit, thought my friend.
"The renegotiation was a bust," and "Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Tony Benn inspirierten Europeans know how robber in Fleet Street at their expense can be and what EU sceptics is the press Oligarchie Barone, as they were during the referendum in 1975 but were not supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
You are weak to remember Boris Johnson, the Erz euro Opportunisten, which has made a name as a "EU Gerade banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90's he years.
For all its craziness, Ed Miliband knew who were his enemies.
This was the Medley of tax for foreigners and the pseudo-Schurken, phone hack non Inländern most of our major newspapers have opened.
Tony Blair actually thought about it, but noted that if it sits in a cage with a hot Gorilla better instead of bananas to distract him, to be distributed to his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more than Blairianer Blair himself, as he does not put on the Camerons referendum eddy because Blair had made the principle adopted the EU constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened him to a back door.
The press that has also never verziehen.
But the nette Jeremy Corbyn, of me in Westminster on Monday gave a friendly pat on the back - I told him that he was no more time for me to vergeuden need - Neil Kinnocks boycott Murdoch strategy to repeat the 80 "s, a mistake at the time and now seems in danger.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy in order to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, the BBC sofa he has left on Sunday.
Corbyns official position on Europe - I press it's friendly - in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformierten EU.
Well, most people outside of traditional blue color fabric trend and the more wild Gefilden Ukips of Torys Klein Engländerismus is probably all say yes.
It is zuzugeben what "A Benn, not a Bennite," said Hilary Benn on the radio and on television this week, as the path finder fought in it, not that Corbyns provozierenden appointment of John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's, when his old father on television is tried to be illoyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues not to go too far and his cabinet job to lose.
Hilarys fight was even more attractive.
But struggling to remain "under all circumstances," Benns expression - was not what said McDonnell, nor what JC told his Mitstreitern and MPs after all the reports on their study session on Monday evening.
Whatever the rührselige Bottom Up image of Corbyn wants to convey - think that he has even me gerührt - news discipline is important in the era of TV around the clock and, above all, in the maelstrom of media Sozialen, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right, Cameron to give a free card for Europe, which allows him to keep for Labour's support in the referendum campaign as a matter of course, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyns basic Mehrdeutigkeiten for EU membership - in line with the Bennite Belagerungs economy, its anti-kapitalistischen past - is no longer just a matter of discussion among leftist dissidents, for the small Narzissmus esoterischen Unterschieds is a zentraler principle of Dogma "disputes.
As with his Mehrdeutigkeiten to NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that JC is launching a campaign to leave rock festival - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in particular.
Why should waste political capital, Paris or Berlin - they have also, more skeptical voters - to make concessions to the British, when everything can be so pointless?
The US is already pretty disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a Kostensenkung of Tory government in power, which at the start on Monday, I was reminded of something, which is called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England report on electronic cigarettes
Claims a state funded agency that electronic cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to Tabakindustrie, said researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined by the Lancet to criticise Nachweise used by Public Health England (PHE) in her report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the "principle" report last month and describes him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have called into question the Belastbarkeit data and pointed to the links between some of the experts and the Tabakindustrie.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "außerordentlich windige basis," reasoned PHE on his most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the allegations "are based on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Öffentlichde Simon Cape well, professor of epidemiology at the University of Liverpool Klinische and health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: "A fundamental principle is that policies should be based on the evidence of the effectiveness of public health."
They said that the public expects PHE's assertion that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking," based on a detaillierten review of Nachweise and modeling.
Indeed, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a more technical criteria Entscheidungs analysis (Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to lead their opinions about the damage of various nicotine containing products to Synthese; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Cape well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health, whose CEO is previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references to public health in a Nachhaltigkeit report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said to receive funds from an electronic cigarette manufacturers, but not the funding it after reports earlier should have received from tobacco company Philip Morris International, she added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not delivered, but they include several known electronic cigarette champions, some of which also indicate an industry funding in the paper.
Some of the other participants in this meeting are not known for their Know how in tobacco control.
Taking part in the meeting also took the PHE tobacco pipe.
The group's research, "admits bezeichnenderweise," wrote that it is the damage of most products on most of the criteria "for a lack of" hard Beweisen McKee and Cape well.
But none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report will be discussed.
McKee and Cape well said that serve as a way to smoking for children or Nichtraucher PHE's assertions that "there is no evidence so far that electronic cigarettes were" premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE said that was already previously responded to the allegations by BMJ.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies at his Sucht.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of electronic cigarettes are small in comparison to this, but that we have to continue to study the long term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the dangers relativen compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a disease with regard to smoking and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion per year.
Through the clear Vorlegen current Beweisen that electronic cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage that is caused by smoking, we meet our national jurisdiction.
BBC should abandon East Enders, former boss of Channel 4 says
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop to send programs such as East Enders and The Voice. "He said that commercial rivals" would give their right arm for hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs, which are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for public legal programs, which is likely to be seen by a smaller audience, to place in controversial Zeitfenster hard against the most popular shows of their rivals and of channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, told Johnson that he is six years into his time at Channel 4 have tried without success to get in touch with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes commissioned or sends the Lords communications committee as part of its inquiry on the future of the BBC, which would also clearly demonstrated by not subventionierten rivals," Johnson said.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think the medium or long term is a good idea, you should at least give its production to programs that others do not, or commissioned.
You send The Voice in einem erstklassigen Zeitfenster, because they want to reach as broad a support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax to fund programs that could be funded without Subventionen.
The voice is such a program, East Enders is another zugegebenermaßen both own product ions.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public and legal television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur, Channel 4 ran from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the chase for ratings, "due to the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long term support."
His comments on the most popular shows of the BBC give that back to what Tony Ball, the former head of Sky in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East Enders.
Johnson said that the programs rather public service "should go to BBC4, where you can pretty much do not measure the audience, but they perform their tasks, and they can argue that if they go to their pseudo saints missions to justify broadcasting fees of £4 billion," Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "
You put them in a Zeitfenster in which no one ever wanted to see them.
For broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more objective recourse system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.
Of course, you all think we all think that we are receiving a great value for £150 per year here, but for those who wonder is £150 for a lot of money, whether that is true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky- and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, aussagte also before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to "inform, to form and maintain."
He said that only a little of the BBC production would now officially klassifiziert as education - he said that there were 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should take an example of public service television in Australia and Canada, this change to "inform, educate and entertain."
On the question of Partnerschaften Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, he said that only a handful of which will be shown on television, and with the commercial broadcasters say alliances to make everything available online.
"Sono Genetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the Nematoden change direction at the moment they are bestrahlt Impulsen with sound.
Scientists have gezüchtet Würmer genetisch modified nervous systems that can be controlled by Ausbrüchen by sound waves.
The tiny Nematoden change the direction at the moment they are bestrahlt Impulsen with sound frequencies that are too high for the human ear to be heard.
The stimulus work by Einschalten Moto Neuron cells genetisch be changed, in order to take the Membran channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Further on this subject: Read and write researchers brain activity with light
The researchers said that Würmer showed the power of a new procedure called sono Genetics at Ultraschall can be used to activate a series of Gehirn- Herz- and muscle cells outside of the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the deep brain stimulation, a abgibt invasives procedure that electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Thread Würmer does not usually respond to Ultraschall Chalasani, however, noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, increase the ultrasonic waves that penetrate into the Würmer.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves act on structures that are called TRP 4 ion channels and in the Membranen Würmer by some of the cells are found.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells that they are zugeordnet, according to a report in Nature Communications.
In order to create Ultraschall controlled Nematoden Chalasani genetisch Würmer modified so that some of its Moto Neuronen TRP 4 ion channels.
If he applies Ultraschall on modified creatures that sound waves are amplified and transmitted through the micro bubbles in the Würmer, where they turn on the amended Moto Neuronen.
The case has some similarities with Opto Genetics, a bahnbrechenden tool allows the scientists Neuronen Impulsen des Lichts auszuschalten.
But sono Genetics Chalasani said, could have a number of advantages to this technique.
In contrast to light that needs to be sent down to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain tissue of low frequency ultrasound waves can happen without hindrance, and can be sent from the top of the skull in the brain.
"We believe that with Gentherapie and a therapeutischen virus, it is possible to make the zielten human Neuronen temporarily vulnerable for Ultraschall signal in a klinischen setting for certain neuro logical treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin produzierende cells, he added.

Eight golden rules for living in student housing homes
Eleven years ago I moved than even vergessener 19 left Berets and moral Relativismus students in a residential home, still in the faith, but now I remind myself of the strained smile - and many of those who I've geärgert langatmigen complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned, can be destilliert in eight simple rules.
The collection in student housing Heime ranges from slightly nervous aufreibend to absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to tell schwatzen: People where you come from, if and where you have sabbatical year taken yet because of where you are in relation to Corbyn and why you love Marmite "said neither honestly hate guys in seriousness, it is only an extract Hefe hahaha, I am" in my room.
You breathe through.
And you help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
In contrast to those with whom you are talking about, even if your eyelashes were on fire and that fire had Löscher guides the conversation and helps you find the people who you would like.
Lassen people.
The rooms of people often turn to drink recipe ions, movie night venues and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people put themselves and their underwear right back.
Related to this, you start thinking not of the university with a relationship
Introverted get a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a Refugium, but many students living Heime form a room to room Bummel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
It can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture that allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship continues, but you have to weggehen so that I get the energy back I verbraucht for interaction with you."
You try to feel when a Kommilitone anzuklopfen Geselligkeit is exhausted - and you will send him a text message.
Speaking of anklopfen: You Tun.
A guy in my student residential homes had the idea that a closed door was an invitation.
He saw a few things.
Backen close friendship.
As you begin the university at the height of the Back mania is the Klopfen at the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of Brownies, less strange than the greeting of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, so I have baked you something. And now please smile, if I ask you a few personal questions."
Hausgemachte offering treats is a good way to close Freundschaften.
Their Mitbewohner feel obliged to entertain themselves and will associate at the end of your face, perhaps with a delicious surprise.
Of course this depends on whether you are a decent Bäcker.
Bad vermischte Klumpen lead from flour, sugar and fat, people are sleeping, if you anklopfen.
To steal food, is a gängiges crime in student residential homes.
Of course, the claws of Hühnchen is a theft, but it is also take a drop Milchs for your tea?
You check the owner with the milk.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves, even when they cook inside.
If someone stiehlt your stuff that is annoying, and you have my Mitgefühl - but you try umzugehen ausgewogener Spülmittel to punish thieves as my Mitbewohnerin added to their milk.
She is now in prison.
You should make no noise abhält people from sleep or work.
It is not just about being a decent person, but that they belong in the truest sense of the word say to the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl on my Flur asked their neighbours to ask whether it makes them a little Drum & Bass something quieter, because it's three o'clock in the morning, and they had a test in the morning.
You responded with yet more loud music.
When they finally at 5 p.m., they left their neighbours freundlicherweise sleep two hours before they had their own music aufhörten plärren abschloss their door and came to the three hour test.
Would it not be romantisch, if your future Ehepartner would randomly move students living in the same home?
It might not be Mitbewohnerin Abgrund deeply embarrassing when you consider your future Ehepartnerin ranmachen to separate them again and they need to see it every day, and perhaps witness as herüber draws all common friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot Mitbewohnerin is definitely not your future Ehepartnerin you try, at least einzureden your body under a little bit of common sense.
Leave In aufregenden moment when you realize that someone has his keys in his room, the line between a Ulk and harassment is not verschlossenem feiner than it seems.
A good trick is funny, but it takes only moments before he is for Bumerang.
Erteilen jemandes Verstecken amüsante and a valuable lesson about security - but you never to flood rooms with dental toothpaste and shampoo.
You Verschließen not more than twice their door, and they put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put their possessions in the tackern Gefrierschrank - but you stuck to the ceiling.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in Eckental means fränkischen terraced houses for people who do not have much money.
So for instance for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need Wohnhraum, but as the single mother and low earners."
"I show how you can build cheap and good even today," says the 44 years old in the interview
Thousands of refugees are pushed in the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheaper Wohnraum can be created: It builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push for the housing market.
What solution you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in Containern or gym halls has no Nachhaltigkeit.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In light of the refugee Stroms Wohnraum we need enough in the next few decades.
A very banales three geschossiges Reihenhaus is the solution.
Gildner: A Reihenhaus needs less space.
It facilitates the integration.
This is different, if it brings people into residential blocks.
Each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three units for four Asylbewerber.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living Aufenthaltsraum.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace, I go back again.
Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000, without plot.
This is überschaubar.
Has taken six months of construction.
This is appropriate.
Have the paramotor verkompliziert their plans?
Gildner, Baur Real, I have learned through my project correctly.
Particularly complicated there is always the threat of Damokles sword Sonderbau and the regulation of parking space.
Creepy.
It is still needs at least three who creates three apartments in a Reihenhaus Stellplätze.
Only in the cities is a lack of space for it.
And refugees and Asylbewerber have no cars.
As residents have responded to their Reihenhaus project?
Gildner Asylbewerber: There have been those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings.
What is definitely not.
But do not exacerbate the competition by bezahlbare housing?
Gildner: Bauboom in Germany is true: We have had in the last five years, but were built luxury flats that no one can afford more.
My project has the message that ordinary people also need Wohnraum.
Not only refugees, but as the single mother or the low earners.
I show how you can still build cheap and good.
So it goes.
Markus Gildner (44) studied micro system technology in Regensburg and employed first with environmental analysis.

Rosbergs only motto: Full attack
Nico Rosberg is clear in the fight for the world championship title in Formula 1 against his leading Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton only has a motto: "Full attack."
Before the start of World Cup Second stressed in the crucial seven overseas races, "that I have nothing more to lose."

District office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the old centre of Antoni Abbey have done together under the cloak of social foundation and the Count Stauffenberg place opened a new Anlaufstelle.
In addition to discussions, one can also take part in courses.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain in the city centre.
More specifically to the Count Stauffenberg place.
There was recently opened a new office district.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and Ratsuchende immediately receive information on issues such as the care insurance or services of health and care fund.
For years, we note with our outpatient care service that pflegende members alone are often ignored.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Too many benefits of cash are often not used because the complexity of insurance is still little understood," the new house Herrin Jutta Weigand, who is responsible for "Amadeus," the Antoni pen and the public hospital, as well as the ambulance service, as well as business area manager of old help explained.
In addition to the deliberations of the new district office also offers courses for prevention, health and wellness.
The Saludis was taken with the boat.
So you can take advantage of additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or a physiotherapy treatment.
The offers from the senior center and the Saludis complement each other in idealer way.
Saludis stands for prevention, Vorsorge and Reha.
"The senior center for care and maintenance," Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis erte.
The reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city centre both female business leaders are particularly in demographic change.
Because it makes a good dezentrale essential infrastructure in the various districts of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) said at the inauguration ceremony, the district office of Vereinsamung widme in old age: "There are many events and offers on the program and invite them to a regular Gesell beisammen".
So the social foundation leiste a great contribution that seniors can live independently and well in their vertrauten environment.

FedEx earnings mixed reduced financial prospects for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for an entire year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said that it plans to anzuheuern about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The shares fell about 2.5 percent in Premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10,40 and $10,90 in the next fiscal year, which ends May 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected, according to a survey by FactSet $10,84.
The lesser prospect comes despite the price increases, which will amount to an average of 4.9 percent and effective on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large packages, which are collected from November.
Kostensenkung, the company said that it still expect earnings compared to the prior year due to higher revenue and will increase because of the growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "solid returns, erbringt globalem given the weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and trade, to be considered."
The plans for the holiday employment plans were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, 90.000 95.000 to hire additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share of $2,44 per share that belief to $2,42 per share, just behind the first twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research said.
Sales rose by 5 per cent to $12,3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12,23 billion.
FedEx has brought a decline in international Prioritäts Versand recorded sales in its unity Express Versand to stagnate in recent years.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales rose by 29 per cent in ground transportation, but the operational result was essentially flat due to higher costs for larger packages and even insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
The Premarket trading for about an hour before the opening FedEx's shares fell by $3,85, or 2.5 percent, to $150,15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
Federal Reserve Strategen two days this week to spend their most anticipated meeting in years sitting around a 27 foot Honduras mahogany table, in order to decide whether it is time to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Drohend verzierten, two of them at one end of the floor sitting room is a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues to put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
The Fed has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximierung US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is a shouted unge Benes third mandate: Financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predict them. It is to be announced on Thursday, if the US economy is ready to start, from the unprecedented stimulus in the short term interest rate close to zero since late 2008 entwöhnt.
Although most economic data show that it is growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed officials anxious to strengthen this volatility by increasing the Zinses for Bunds - and it is also only about a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important in the first place, what they" see Lindsey M. Piegza, Chefökonomin at the brokerage firm Stifel Nico Laus said & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty is enough justification to continue to wait around the global market," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which unsettled the financial market to itself.
About half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently have predicted a rate increase this week.
Financial markets expect the Fed, with a key indicator, but a Abwarten anzeigt only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market, if the Fed increases the sentence, unless that Strategen abmildern blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228,89 points, or 1.4% to 16.599,85.
The action has been triggered by expectations that the Fed policy this week's sentence aufrechterhält, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time, "he said.
If it does, "they would have to go very far in their statement, in order to reassure the financial markets, so that they are not in panic."
Other experts argued that a rate increase would reassure the financial markets, because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed on the way to increase the rate of 0,25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a langsamen tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said that despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress this year they would be required to expect a rate increase in spring and early summer.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and in the vicinity of the Levels, the Fed considers Vollbeschäftigung.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly under the year target of 2% of the central bank, said the Fed's representatives that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower Ölpreisen.
"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macro Economics.
But the financial markets all over the world zuckten together late last month, after China had abgewertet its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would drosseln global growth.
Something the market has recovered in this month, with the Dow is now up almost 10% below the high of last May.
For the Fed representatives should influence the market turbulence of the complex calculation, when to increase rates.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks had not occurred, it would attract the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get to grips with the impact better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," Oliner said.
None of the Fed's main concerns is the health of the global economy, so they should be involved in their decisions not technically.
But in the end, the Fed's monetary authority in the world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint of Ben S. Bernanke then leader in 2013 that the Fed could reduce their monetäre expansion "Vere," triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined with each other, that they not only monitor the developments elsewhere, but also with other central banks can be expected from the Fed representatives and experts advise that in order to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision is "more art than science," said Zachary Kara Bell, head of global strategy for the asset management of the firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., said this month that "the Fed has a history of excessive reactions to market movements, which apparently are not associated with the fundamental economic data."
Lacker, a voting berechtigtes de uses for an interest rate increase, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite begrenzter erkennbarer impact on growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, these cuts made the Fed chief.
The Fed should set only during a severe crisis as the market collapse in 2008 in the first place aspects of financial stability, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee for the Bank of England to set interest rates.
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level, he said.
"You will certainly not get in the situation in which she has said fear of a rate increase, because the markets" aufregen, poses, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not mentioned Finanzstabilität, and until that is changed, I do not think they should rush ahead of time.

Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing ourselves to this possibility."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who live and want to achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up on the morning of the first refugees at the border Serbiens EU neighbour Croatia.
Most were from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan, according to media reports.
They were both by bus and by Taxen in the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival they had tried to reach the green border on foot to Croatia.
On the kroatisch Serbian border encounter the refugees not to border Zäune.
The border strip carries other risks: There are still sharp jugoslawischen mines civil war in the 1990s.
Minenräumer will now quickly create a safe passage.
Little more refugees come to Hungary, however, following the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, the police counted aufgegriffene 366 people.
Just before Torschluss on Monday there were still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws Zauns stufen overcoming and damage of the border as a crime.
In the southern Hungarian border city of Szeged 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.

According to the immigration authorities have received a total of 94 Asylanträge, almost all - 93 on Tuesday in the new set up at the border "transit zones" - the most important transition Röszke.
Under the proposal, Tel Lern 13 families with small children, and two were elderly.
On Wednesday morning, there still 40 refugees would have stopped.
Virtually nobody has a chance, however, to be granted asylum in Hungary.
Ungarischer believe that Serbia is a "sicheres Drittland."
The abgelehnten Asylbewerber are there to be deported.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke gathered only a few hundred refugees.
In Röszke workers started mopping up.
They collected the garbage had left tens of thousands of people in recent weeks by the roadside.
Sperrgitter abgebaut and one of the reception camp in Grenzort was rebuilt.
The goal of this transformation, no one wanted to express themselves.
Austria reach only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its Grenzkontrollen.
About 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government data.

Mayor drove "Gestrandete" over the border
"We were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the mayor Alois Wernsteins Aufräumen, when ten people were suddenly with travel suitcases at the entrance of the tent," says Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted the train to Passau.
Because Germany had stopped rail traffic with Austria for a surprise, it was on Sunday but because of the refugee Stroms Wernstein chauffierte closure, "said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the edge of the rocks, along with two other volunteers and their cars over the border to near Passau.
Once we have the incomparable verköstigt hoped guests with Jause and drinks.
We have said the same, we bring them by car to Passau.
"So it was natural for us," Stadler OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man could not take it to hand over a donation großzügige - 100 euros for the fire brigade.

In Wernstein Grenzüberschreitende is generally high in the course.
The bridges combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday gesellig sports tags before a run of two bridges - organized by the Union and Wernstein Bavaria from Neukirchen.
That Viktor Orbán sends another Zigtausende to us now is a logical outcome of a sham saints policy:
Instead of helping in Röszke camp immediately with the construction of structures that ensure Humanität, our Bundeskanzler has high officially and publicly put the attitude of the Hungarian government in the haze of circle Nationalsozialismus.
Sorry end of this policy are not just the Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The Geflüchteten also will have to say that the "promised land" they invited and welcomed welcome is nothing but another Flüchtlingslager.
There will be a major challenge, given the ongoing Flüchtlingsströme and the approaching Winters, producing menschenwürdige conditions for protection search at our end.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.

If those who call the shots on his grandfather's time in the US, he would have been like, "he would never arrived there at all."
"There are more issues than him," Inter San winemakers daughter Sarah Bühler says.

For easy gewichtige diabetics can be helpful for weight loss surgery.
The benefits of weight loss surgery is easy on gewichtige people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether easy gewichtige chirurgische people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive treatment.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Black Stone, an expert of weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to get the size of the Magens verkleinern.
You reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years obesity operations have been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been carried out on people who are ill arrest fettleibig with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24,9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered fettleibig.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers used data from Taiwan's Min Sheng General Hospital, which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery, gastric Bypass and stomach tubing including education, medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who undergo this operation, fell from 31 to 24,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile remained roughly the same in 29 of the BMI in those who received non chirurgische diabetes treatments
Among those who undergo a surgery completely solved the diabetes disease at 36% and 28% in part.
In the medically treated group succeeded in only about two percent compared to only one percent of diabetes in full or in part.
In addition, were the results in the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL Cholesterins "generally better in the surgery group," the authors found out.
The researchers also überwachten mirror of the patient's blood Hämoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hämoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the surgery, the average Hämoglobin A1c level fell by about 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group but remained stable at around 8 percent.
But these better glykämische "control" - as it is reflected in the improved Hämoglobin A1c level - not reduced mortality in five years, the Leitende researcher Dr. Chih Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
The fifth year the Bypass surgery group compared to the Gastrektomie group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater reverse course in BMI (7.4 at 5.1) and Hämoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded a more complete overcoming of diabetes (46,9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival before part of the surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more difficult people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Black Stone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study was in obese people who undergo an obesity surgery, about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years, compared to a group, the konventionellere tried methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the surgery patients, said Black Stone, it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group," no increased risk of death or kidney disease, they said.
Black Stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously, as soon as the patient lies with his BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think that we wait too long, until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that a reversal "as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that are associated with obesity and diabetes in their body is really hard.

"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees, is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long term solutions, such as a genuine Friede and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how the killing was reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and George Bush's action also commented after the September 11 Terroranschlag and emphasised that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I have expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in nonviolence.
"I know his motives were good, but he set up violence, and this has led to unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.

Why I will be able to witness a Exekution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch how a man is put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will sit in a public gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation has been on his best friend, and although I was shocked I agree, for the first time in January.
As the day got closer, I began to fear me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists must see Hinrichtungen makabere lottery in the United States, and often there are more applications than places available, will take place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch it without emotion.
I can't.
I will sit alongside Richard Glos IPS engstem friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with Telefonaten and a visit to two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot if we are talking about.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so it will be allows me a notebook and a pen mitzunehmen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remind me of all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, give up my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
You tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants it, and you get access.
I values me with her.
You admitted that "it could be better," but she still thinks that it is wrong, what I do.
Richard Glossip has had a problem with some of the things I have said and written.
He tells me not to say what I have to write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter is present, in order to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that the publicity will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bell Ware, a report in the Huffington Post, is sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the Podcasts series, which I have done.
I will not go back on all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a Begünstigter fact.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn for that.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die a needless death.
Man after moist police chase persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale redete policeman remained dry, as he with the man from the Canning River.
An attempt of a man from Perth police abzuhängen was unsuccessfully to return as he was in the seichten and swamp water, only a few metres away from a Polizeibeamten sanft tried to "überreden him to shore."

Peter Moody says that stewards tried to spy him and threatens to end the racing sport
Peter Moody claimed that Racing Victoria stewards tried to install a Spion in his stables in the past year and threatened to end the race.
He zielte by Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the Late Lady Tatai Scratching Halm on Wednesday due to a race day treatment, the last straw, to the stewards and the Integritäts department.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and he did when it came to the positive cobalt Tupfer test at Lidaris vorgefunden themselves under difficult conditions which he cannot explain.
He had 18 months because of espionage charges that it withheld and did not "look like at high hanging grapes."
"I had to say anything about it, and I have spent a long time out, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know that it went further.
Sometimes you responded, and we must live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I would like to collected head to go around, and I would like to think that my owner that I try my best for them.
If they start to think, I do not do this, then I should no longer be coach.
I must then consider what I do with my license.
Previously had the bomb in an interview with Moody Racing .com can go high that Integritäts department had tried to spy on his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I'll call when I am asked what I do - and offered him a job in my stables, in order to provide information on Racing within my Ställe," Moody said.
You seem to believe that I am a fraudster.
If that is the case, it should certainly be on their noses, because they have failed in an attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL were aware of this at the time and there are still today.
Would like to bring this to the view that it is personally?
The RVL has behaved cowardly and makes perhaps people outside of trainers responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Perhaps the people out there think that I am there.
Maybe they need to let me take my license and offend me, and I have no doubt that what I say, they think about it now.
But I have now reached the point where it is no matter to me, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustrations levels of Trainers have with the long ongoing cobalt investigation in Lidari built, and the Late Scratching meant that he said that he "could throw his license on the table."
Moody, best known through his preparation of Black Caviar ungeschlagenen master, called the race day Behandlungs rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the legs of horses, which was against the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing sport.
I must take full responsibility for that, "he said.
"One of my employees has applied irrtümlicher mud on the leg.
It was last night as can be.
May be so it had throughout the day yesterday, which was also the case.
It was also so Renntag.
Moody could be faced with a three month Disqualifikation for the treatment with the pack on Renntag. Opened an investigation into this matter.
It is a joke.
People who make these rules do not know anything about the horse.

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back against rivals for claims to ring fight
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticism of the tack Ling described his players as "Agenda Setting" of two Premier League favourites in the NRL.
Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said that the referees have allowed the Storm players "ring" struggles with his team during the high Storm's victory in the Qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a little verhüllte note the Storm team, after his team had reached the Final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "Musterbeispiel from Queensland Rugby League" and said that the two were not "too good" in the Ringen.
Bellamy defended his team's Tacklimg and said that they were concentrated at the tack Ling only on their "contact."
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches his team confident stimme him because it meant that they were worried to be beaten by the Storm team.
"That emerges again and again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson spoke about fighting ring, as they have beaten us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that, throughout the year, we have changed nothing in our defensiven Trendwende system or techniques. But in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has provided for us.
Trent is obviously a great team to train there for three years now, and he has to lose, and he is therefore probably not accustomed to, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is funny how that appears again and again in this season.
Bellamy Bennetts idea was attacked as a "football from" exciting football "and his mentor reminded that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with" long.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He has compared his game on Saturday evening with our game on Friday night, and how exciting it was, "said Bellamy.
I remember that St George was criticized in 2010 as a long because team, and Wayne said that he will attend a Scheiß dirt.
But now he has a team that can play and that we regard as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game that you want to play when you have these kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play the kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.
I baue stronger confidence, because they say these things because they are a bit concerned, having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably have not thought of us when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against ROOSTERS achieved a better result than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.
The Broncos' game was a good game, I have not yet seen it, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two more attempts in our game, but it is an exciting game?
Make or break and Spannendes no points?
For me, it is the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet in a stage still on it.
The Storm team has released this weekend, as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the cron Ulla Vorfinale Sharks next Saturday night at AAMI Park. The ticket sale will start from next Tuesday morning.

JVA Berlin Tegel: Five square meter cell are people unwürdig
The Federal Constitutional Court has given a former detainee of judicial enforcement Tegel right monatelang was housed in a small cell.
Because of the violation of their Menschenwürde prisoners in principle entitled to financial compensation, if they are housed in small cells.
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, even if those affected can hope for money, if they were only a few days in the tight spaces (Az.: 1 BvR eingesperrt 1127 / 14).
So that was a former detainee successfully with its constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space in the Justice Institute Berlin Tegel prison between June and November 2009; the toilet was not spatially separated.
Then, the man who is now back at large was, according to his lawyer, had been moved to a larger cell.
Although his liability lawsuit because of Berlin unwürdigen prison conditions against the country failed.
But the constitutional judge lifted on the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and had the case for further examination there.
You can see the Menschenwürde violated of the man.
The supreme court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if for only a few days in prison days the compensation are important for legal reasons from the period in question was given a compensation claim, it said.
Otherwise a Verkümmern Rechtsschutzes personality would be "to fear."
The Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of compensation money.
The constitutional judges have strengthened the rights of criminal prisoners many times in the past.
So they only spoke in April of a detainee eingesperrt damages because he was naked in a cell.
People unwürdig is also the more specialist type of a cell without a separate toilet, according to a 2011 decision.
Karlsruhe also confirmed a man unwürdige accommodation on Wednesday, in addition to the Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in Berlin in November 2009.
The plaintiff then was placed on three months between 15 to 21 hours every day in the same cell as in Karlsruhe.
The Berlin Gefängnisse had come due to lack of staff in the headlines in recent weeks.
Prisoners are locked up for 23 hours Aggressivität rises again and again, even to bat shops, it should have come earlier because of the tense situation.
According to information of Justice press office in Tegel 21 places are not open due to lack of talent, 19 2016 wegfallen.
Angela Merkel and the Flüchtlingspolitik: "We create the"
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Bundeskanzlerin is determined to adopt them.
What comes to Germany?
Around 800 000 Asylbewerber Germany is even capable of absorbing a million refugees will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Interior this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD).
Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination: "I say again and again: We can create that, given the unusual challenge and we create it."
What zukommt on Germany, gives the following overview.
Used to be different forecasts between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of Pestel Institut) homes a year - and for the next five years.
That is almost twice as much as 250000 homes will be built (so far).
Dramatically, the lack of Wohnraum is, however, especially with bezahlbaren rental properties: A year fall out 60000 to 80000 social housing refugees from the rental price fixing, and this particularly affordable housing will also apply.
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) will therefore double the promotion of currently 518 million to one billion euros.
Far too little is that from the point of view of Pestel Institut: Social housing 80 000 a year would have to occur and that would have the federal government invest a promotion to the tune of 6.4 billion per year.
Are scientists and federal construction minister agreed that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for work Markt- and professional research is expected that 55 percent of Geflüchteten can eventually be acquisition work in Germany.
Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education, however, were not systematically asked for their qualifications, in order to help them at the start, criticised the refugees in Germany in Bertel Mann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees is crucial, however, is whether they can find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self esteem of immigrants, migration for Douglas Dietrich Thränhardt says.
There has been a political turning point: The ban on work for refugees in recognition of work according to Thränhardt in Germany.
Whereas before there was a ban on work for Asylbewerber by up to five years, this has been reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the duty of residence, limited Asylbewerber at a residence.
In the view of society - also because of a lack of skilled workers - the majority has asserted that refugees should be allowed faster access to employment.
A major hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of knowledge of English.
So far there are no ausreichendes offer language courses related to education and work.
Studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore Thränhardt view of the royal road to integration work.
The Berlin school administration found that few geflüchtete parents give their children in Kitas, there are an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the entwurzelten zuhalten parents is very important, the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family still hand slip from the benefits of Kita, the administration distributed in different languages.
The need for female educators should rise sharply by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing more schools.
Students in the countries without knowledge of German welcome classes are prepared for the classroom.
You are fully trained but not always informed Lehrerinnen and teachers, but also, as in Berlin, of teaching staff who have a qualification in English as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of Berlin school administration.
The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no state Asylbewerbern or patience, but prohibits the study - the only exception was so far Berlin, inside Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his attitude.
Studierwilligen refugees could be made easier access to university.
For refugees with a stay Gestattung Asylbewerber performance or Duldung receive no benefits under the law, if they start a study.
The latter have basically no Bafög, because they are not covered by the circle of people entitled to BAföG.
Geduldete refugees have so far had to have lived in Germany for four years, in order to be Bafög right from 1 January 2016 to cut the margin to 15 months.
This funding gap needs to be closed, Steffen Krach Berlins undersecretary for science, and the German student demand.
Students should immediately get Bafög.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many of the refugees are Muslims, and for many, the religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should give Islam gradually the same rights as they have the churches, and the existing state churches right weiterentwickeln Religionen ratio to a new state.
Also important would be the establishment of an Islamic charity drive professional association that cares for the newcomers.
Belong to the rights and obligations.
As the representatives of Islam must agree on clear Ansprechpartner and be willing to cooperate with the government in many areas and give him some Kontrollmöglichkeiten.
This also includes the willingness to act against religious Fundamentalismus beherzt.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts will be taken to Germany on Thursday.
Those who have wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany, "to immediately have their right, the Bayrischen Rundfunk verwirkt here, in Germany," he said.
He proposed to translate the Grundgesetz to Arabic.
Integration will be a theme of the whole society, much longer than today.
So that the majority of society will have to change, the elimination of discrimination and racism is pushing.
Germany has a point against discrimination and Allgemeines equal opportunities law - as a result of European decisions - for less than a decade.
But it is very slow, as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What not white German immigrant organizations and interest groups are calling for a long time and what international agreements require Germany, such as the Anti Racism Convention, must be a reality in the next few years, if the country remain peaceful and his new Bürgerinnen citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany was able to feed the refugees expected to date medical doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery says.
"In terms of man- power and capacity we create that," he told the Daily Mirror.
But for that extra money has to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls for health cards to hand all the same Ankömmlingen during registration.
Services provided could be abgerechnet later with the states.
And in the long run, it is highly fragwürdig abzuspeisen vorsehe so many people with limited performance catalogue, the Asylbewerber performance law.
Otherwise, the doctors are, above all, to create the language barriers.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proven, migrants will be aufgeklärt about their illness worse than other patients.
Praxen Dolmetscher costs would be taken not only in clinics, also a doctor, she urges.
Helped would be many refugees but also with more general medical Ambulanzen starting points in the event of an emergency.
And with another diagnostischen look.
Under refugee children, for example, give it far more unbehandelte disabilities and HIV awareness among young people go there.
German doctors would come in terms of their education but clear, with the images of some other disease, Montgomery says.
"Para Siten Befall or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And regarding the lack of doctors, even relief in sight is perhaps by the refugees.
The Syrians have a high entwickeltes education, many refugees are even doctors.
To practice, they would have to prove their skills, however, might take exams again.
At least half of the refugees in Germany ankommenden is mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of psychological therapists (BPtK): Most suffer from post traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly verletzlich explains BPtK Dietrich Munz, President.
A recently published study of the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in Germany traumatisiert.
Anyone who is suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder, suffers from others in so called flash backs with Atemnot, dizziness, heart lawn and Todesängsten.
Other symptoms Schlaf- and concentration problems, firm strong shock and emotional taub are.
In order to prevent that the symptoms would be chronically, an early treatment needed, Munz said.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive a psychotherapy.
Mentally ill Asylsuchende in Sozialämtern can make a request for psychotherapy, but the treatment usually takes several months.
Subject officials or doctors were not trained for mental illness in the Sozialämtern also tend to decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.
This often leads to false assessments, Munz says.

Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every Streiche canvas.
The "four legged Arti" every desire of the eyes, as they are affectionately called, will read as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.

HP is split into two listed companies later this year and the Computer- and printer business from its faster growing enterprise hardware and services Leistungs separate business activities.

FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb must be behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere, it was not until September and provided his Rehabilitation is proceeding according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
I am sure this optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his participation in next summer's European Championship, is still uncertain.
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate Knöchel violation and then again was back to his old swing found during the Vorsaison.
This kind of "at risk of injury, not the career," Wenger said.
It is a bone heilte not good.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his Knöcheln or with the injuries that he had before.
That may be true, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injury from a purely medical point of view, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops a unangenehmes pattern.
The study by Premier injuries Ltd 23 different diseases of Wilshere recorded since his debut six years ago.
League games in the last five games he played in just 65 of Arsenals 157 times.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have suffered the most injury days in six of eight times since 2007 / 08.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and combat force," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilized durchlaufen, I am confident that he will do it and he is a career of the sort that he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday evening before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and" the players who need it to treat a small Verschnaufpause, Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites in Group F play on the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds in Europe with the biggest effect of intimidation.
Unge beat Dynamo after 41 games, after the "unbesiegbar" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium has been shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, and 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale.
This year, it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lesson from the last season with the Champions League defeat against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope with his management to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
In 2006, we were very close to it, but on the other hand, I am in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ehrgeizig, but we are not dreamers.
Friends: The comedy show that gives us some serious lessons about men Freundschaften
The lack of similar representations in shows is evident, particularly with regard to how the need for men to open itself has become even verzweifelter now than ever before, such as suicide rates among young men at a 15 year high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In a bid to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign announced at a erbärmliches life) 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressiven Symptomen verdoppelten has found that, when suffering a high enough percentage to friends with healthy mood, "had his chances of recovery.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the risk of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first, so that a friendship can work.
In the age of the communications held on social media, with its emphasis on style over substance, the direct nature of the response is often more important than the importance of full contact.
Our digital lives have fun the need to appear strong, and successful lives, doubled, even if in reality dominates the isolation.
This oberflächliche success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsische values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsischer go much deep values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that has an impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently said that money can't buy happiness really.
The nice thing with Friends was that this focus has been placed on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but because of his personality, which was conspicuous by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey Chandlers frequent Umarmungen moments in football gucken gemütlichen armchairs and longing of Ross and Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to, in any case, even if they often zurückhalten to fully explore their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me:... "my listeners role for people who feel depressed and at risk of suicide has been really clear to me how even the smallest Interaktionen of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us, often feel unable to talk with friends.
The old speech saying "I come with that" has a huge impact, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness, if you talk about problems openly. "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer langfristigere coping mechanisms.
You clearly presents the small moments of men Freundschaften.
As much as my objektiver outsider status on the phone to people in Augenblicken of despair may help the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you visit this weekend Comedy Central with friends to celebrate the day completely newly designed scenery, why not take it with you to your friends a drink at the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone just sitting around in Star Bucks, you give him a smile and you say Hallo.
You never know what difference could make your friendship.

If you die, you come to the museum.
The beeindruckende collection had already made before in Montreal, Canada and Paris station.
"It is about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger more died.
It was about tolerance, Akzeptanz and the vision of an open society.
Little to look at the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history to have an education without ever completed.
Chrono choreographiertes total art work, which was operated for much effort: The show is not established, but it is a perfectly logical to frisieren the doll was involved, for example, specifically a stylist.

Also schwächle currently export to Russia and the United States.
Enough reasons so for new ways.
The industry association tried to score points by environmental consciousness, as Cordula Bauer said of the Stick Perle hawks stone: "Since this year, we have a quality seal, which shows that we produce verträglich environmentally and socially."

The machine stickt Kügelchen small in some places.
The gold smiths Plauener Champion Bianca Hall Bach Krauße could inspire them: "Before I could start with traditional Plauener tip nothing."

In an elaborate procedure they prägt the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region to identify with the subject Plauener lace - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies - mainly to customers in the United States, Australia and Finland, whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area, like a piece of memory.
So I see my jewelry as modern ambassadors of Plauener lace.

EU wants to double mercury limit in prey fish
The European Commission wants to double the Grenzwerte for mercury in large predatory fish and the Verbrauchern zumuten a much higher dose of the nerve's gifts.

After doubling the Grenzwerte then just 14.5 percent would not käuflich.
The EU in return for the easing will exacerbate Grenzwerte according to watch the food at other grams of fish from the current 0.5 milliseconds to 0.1 millimeter of mercury per kilogram.
Food Watch described this as a "trick" because small peaceful fish such as carp are most impacted so low that they comply with the planned Höchstwerte today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfides diversion, which helps the economy alone," said Wolf Schmidt.
A high for people giftiges heavy metal mercury anreichert Nahrungskette is particularly strong in predatory fish.
The federal government warns so that "even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system especially in Ungeborenen."
The Federal Ministry for world explains on its website regarding the current Höchstwerte but that was "not to expect a" health risks to the general population.
Mercury come mainly through coal Verbrennung in the environment.
The German coal plants run according to a written information of the Federal Ministry for world to the Greens federal MP Anna Lena Baer emittierten Bock in Germany more than six tons of mercury a year, two thirds of the total amount.
