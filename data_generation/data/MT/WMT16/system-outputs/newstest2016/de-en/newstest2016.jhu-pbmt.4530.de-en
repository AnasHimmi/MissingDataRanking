The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement, and Tehran's destabilizing actions in the Middle East.
During the meeting, but it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians, and debated two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is stretched for years.
Washington criticizes the ongoing Israeli settlement construction and Netanyahu blames a lack of commitment to the peace process.
Advertised by Obama's deal with the Iranian nuclear program, the relationship between the two has continued to deteriorate.

In an emergency call professor to have shot his girlfriend admits
In an emergency, Professor Shannon Lamb with a slightly quavering told the police that he had shot his girlfriend, and that officials would have to come to his house.
Lamb, it was important to point out that his "sweet dog" but still live and likely to be excited, and he said that the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was gekritzelt on a white block: "I am so tired of doing it, I wanted to, I could make it back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, was already 300 miles went to the school grounds, according to the police, a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office was shot and killed.
Delta State University police chief Lynn said Wednesday that university staff the shooting at 10: 18 p.m. have heard.
He said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb committed suicide as the police einkesselte him.
A day after the shootout at the university, which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated lamb.
The investigators at both ends of the state published details, as well as revelatory as students and staff who knew him, helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said that they were happy to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned lamb in a book written by him, in which he referred to the "beautiful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
They both taught in the department of social sciences and history, whose teaching staff consists of 17 members, and many students attended classes from both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, praised the Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm had told him that he was at the end of the academic year 2014-15 had to do with stress.
Lamb the Delta State University, had previously asked for a leave for health reasons, and said that he had a health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the employment of the university meant that the promotion of the lamb had worked so hard for him, no guarantee of an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.
University President William upon said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but, of course, "there was something in Mr Lambs idea."
These are questions that can no longer answer lamb.
After fleeing the campus, the police found later Lambs lane when he scored again in Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested lamb killed, selbstmit a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
In 2009, Lamb began his work at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla hair tone said she was 15 and 20 lamb was when she met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her the guitar.
He was at the time, the women flock.
All the girls melted away when he was there, "said hair tone, now 40, and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon resident.
Lamb and Prentiss were apparently some time together.
In an emergency, Lamb said, "I have killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who was with them in the brick house, which is adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was fine.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O 'Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but have remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O "Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
"Steen said he had never met lamb, but by using his daughter, he heard that lamb was interested in music and blues.
Lamb hit Prentiss, when he and Abigail three years ago at a summer fair.
Later, they played a gig.
"Steen said that his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a barman and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said that he and Prentiss, Lamb Night in the night of September 5, the last time I saw after Lamb, his guitar and harmonica play stopped in front of a sparse crowd had ended.
There was no signs that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were laughing and joking with each other on the up.
I think they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, headed the first semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student's committee.
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including teachers, staff, students and members of the community in a Kerzenlicht-commemoration.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" while singing.
Classes will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students to return," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt, and that lamb described in his emergency Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have never married.

Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the royalty, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it is gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simuliertes yawn and a poor length from the Princess of Wales on a date.

UN chief says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says its response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" in the nearly five years of conflict, more weapons and violence and misery for millions of people, only worse.
Once again, the UN chief urges all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly to meet later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "beyond this situation."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show in tackling the crisis in Syria, the same solidarity and unity in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to draw Donald Trump from the upper echelons of surveys downwards, it has not worked yet ().
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump in double digits, and some start seriously to ask what the chances of the nomination of the real estate Moguls.
Of course, it is still too early in the term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that it was at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership, given to the rising Herman Cain, none of which also won only one state in the nominating process.
And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative group Club for Growth economy now see Trump's perseverance and begin to make their dollars go to overthrow him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that indicate that the real estate mogul, is not just a temporary phase.
Trump's popularity ratings have revolved around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid June, showed a survey of Monmouth University that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate Mogul positively.
By the middle of July, there were 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, there were 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive opinion of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac-vote in Iowa last week, has found that 60 percent of Republicans have a positive opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN / ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "angry" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "thrilled" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters that they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" when Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, the candidate said.
A majority of Republicans see Trump's temperament is not a problem.
While Donald Trump widely for his bombastic and insulting statements will be criticised, 52 percent of Republicans negligible Irish voters that the real estate mogul and the right temperament for a president, as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first primary state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent, that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, ABC / Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put their scholar hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN / ORC poll from last week, four out of ten, that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change from the time when four out of ten at the end of July, put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters had in the past, not the clearest crystal ball.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry will win the nomination would only 28% compared to the final candidate Mitt Romney.
However, it appears that a large number of GOP voters, Trump's campaign as a plausible.
Even if the Republicans had a different candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts suggest that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while the anti-Trump support to more than a dozen other candidates diffuse is distributed.
But a poll by Monmouth University at the beginning of September, shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping the majority support.
He has a 13 point lead over Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio, 14 points ahead of Walker 15 points, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie, 33 points.
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson was the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race overtake.
A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have made up their minds.
A new CBS / NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump, say that they have lent their voices.
Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change the opinion.
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
However, Trump's strongest competition at the moment, the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have made up their minds, are twice as likely for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago, immigrants from Mexico called "rapists" immigration was the lynchpin in the public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic language of Trump crucial Hispano-Americans from the Republican Party will keep and which will damage Neuorientierungs's efforts.
But according to the new ABC / Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that with Trump on issues of immigration.
So, as long as the immigration remains in the spotlight, it will also do seem to Donald Trump.
The frustration with the government climbs to new highs.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson now accounts for around half of the support of Republican voters, especially by their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say the new Monday's ABC / Post, they want a political outsider, rather than someone with government experience.
And they are also angry at Washington.
A poll by the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago, shows that three out of four Iowa-Republicans about the Republicans in Congress are frustrated, dissatisfied with 54 percent, "" and 21 percent "the angry."

They showed a focused and committed vision to shine without.
Piraeus had won its last six home games in the premier class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1: 3) stumbled here.
But the Bavarians in seven European Cup-duels with Greek teams undefeated champion, did not want to be the next victim.
They were more brave in their offensive efforts but often too unimaginative.
The attacks were launched by playing too often shift to left Douglas Costa, who crossed against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right, went down when his flank from the right field in the upper left Toreck.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2: 0.
One of the best opportunities in half, Robert Lewandowski had.
First, when Zoltan-striker Ideye Brown, the head of the Polish football from the line proposed (26).
Then, by direct acceptance that goalkeeper Roberto parierte with the knee (35th).
Although the Bavarians raise their usual dominantes game, Piraeus acupuncture could set.
Reliance on goalkeeper Manuel was two.
For example, when he has a shot of the bar drew Ideye (56th).
In front of Neuer Guardiola had to defend a small chain with Preußen in the centre alongside Jerome Boateng, who made it good.
Mario idol, back to what problems in the squad, sat outside.
The first hero was only after the completion of training given the green light, said sporting director Matthias Sammer "Sky": "If you want to turn it into something else, which is evil."

At least a Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium.
Smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth
Smokers not only harms the lungs, but also the teeth - that suggests a long term study of Potsdam.
The good news: The risk of abandonment is falling.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is apparent from the long term study of an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute of Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to nonsmokers, smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely, the 2.5 to 3.6-fold higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
Leading causes of tooth loss are dental caries and inflammation of the meat, the DIfE stresses.
This saliva dries somewhat smoking is a risk factor, the authors point out.
The link between smoking and tooth loss, therefore, go back to frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoke also increased the risk of caries.
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time, "the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research."
However, it could take more than ten years before the threat sinke back to the level of nonsmokers, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham, England.
We have to convince people to take up smoking, study director Heiner Boeing said the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the life."
Not to smoke in the lungs and blood vessels and is good for our findings to a good dental health well into old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by loss, the DIfE announced.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long term study, the findings untermauere.

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP,
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration facilities for disputes between corporations and states, therefore, are to be replaced by a more transparent system that meets its operation significantly more traditional dishes.
"We want to set up a system to which the public trust," said the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
TTIP through the world's largest free trade zone is to emerge with 800 million people.
The plans for reform of the current arbitration can see clearly that the EU countries and the United States jointly independent judges to select a new investment tribunal.
You have to come in equal parts from the EU, the United States and from third countries.
There is also a second instance for the first time.
It would allow it to appeal against judgments.
So far, the procedure agreed among themselves to referee, an appeal against their sentences, there was not.
In the debate over the past few months, it is clear that citizens of the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, not trusted, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she wants to work according to their own figures on an international investment tribunal.
For example, there could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states.
Especially those of large corporations demanded Investor State Arbitration (ISDS) is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitrators are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel judicial system, the companies can wrest compensation at the expense of the taxpayer to circumvent national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards.
In the first statements described anti-TTIP organizations like Campact, the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.
The criticism that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
The German economy State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), however, described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission needs to reform key points, the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers have drawn up.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government welcomed the plans by Malmström.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned to limit the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules.
Particularly small and medium sized businesses could be disadvantaged by it.
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) will be completed on Wednesday remained unclear.
Negotiations are under way since the middle of 2013.
The issue of investor protection has been discussed but not with the United States.
Originally a framework should be for the agreement at the end of this year.
This date is considered to be no longer tenable.
Delicate folk from a sceptic in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (sits today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flip chart on which the timid acting folk singers the US state of Michigan has recorded with a felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost struck by Stevens speech.
He tells from different places, which he repeatedly einzeichnet on the map, which will report its meticulously and delicately arranged songs.
Where they are, and how it looks in his home country.
Since then, Stevens turns out to be a wonderful creative madman.
With the third album, released in 2003, and "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" composed songs that can harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties snuggle, but always drifting into the great opulent seem wise.
There is a rumor, "Michigan" would be the first part of an audacious series: Each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row.
But in 2004, and has already appeared in Rhine near "Seven Swans" and breaks positively certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens is here.
Live guitar and banjo with him.
A year later, the musician living in New York, back to the series.
With "Illinois" ("a sceptic Invites You To: Come on Feel the Illinoise") is a highly acclaimed masterpiece board in 2005.
Überbordend of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album in the US Billboard charts and is lacking in any year best list of influential music media.
After a very productive experiments Stevens uses on "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic fragments.
This sixth studio album is still widely orchestrated, but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and Hall.
Long the smaller clubs entstiegen, the stage shows a colourful spectacle of neon-head bands and large fluorine zie render stage decoration.
Currently, a sceptic tours as part of a five-member band in Germany.
In the dark held Hamburg More!
He presents the theatre mainly available since March, "Carrie & Lowell."
Although nearly 2,000 guests sit here now glued to their chairs, the much more mature that Stevens returns to the intimacy and the folk.
To be without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians is enriched by the album.
We hear from the audience: The lecture was "abundant" and thus you can basically throw away the "plate."
Only a modest encore Stevens says, plays acoustically a few older songs and, finally, you would not want a barrage of applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut is expected at the Prime Minister's Question Time with tension
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to his debut in the Prime Minister's Question Time and for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will rise up to the first of his six set points shortly after noon, with his performance probably by the media and the Labour MEPs from the subject.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he might skip a few sessions to leave to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet, and after his speech at the Tuc-annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour leader, on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain to remain in silence, criticism from a number of Tory most provoked and is at the heart of several front page stories in newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem, has drawn attention to
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence," and he has acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he had come to the Labour leader, to sing the national anthem, "independent" from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused, Mr Corbyns top team to serve, and they refer to differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin 1988 says that political differences within Labour "stack" after Mr Corbyn's remarks on the position of the European Union, and the reduction in profits.
Mr Corbyn said the Tuc conference that Labour amendments to present to the whole idea of a limit as a whole.
Hours later, said Mr. Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, said that the party was "very clear" that she only against the government's plans, the limit of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader, David Cameron, the Tory leader, since he is in the last decade at the Dispatch Box in the House, opposite.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says that he "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and he has more than 30,000 comments.
The Islington North MP said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too konfrontativ, and that he is "both repartee and refrain from arguing with the barbs and instead to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business minister, will represent him, if he does not take part - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also brought to the idea that other colleagues speak from time to time, and that he had referred to John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he is from the policy in the style of a "theatre" to remove polls, which is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later, he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as a key barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons, and his standing among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that she had become a caricature and in need of reform.

Pound rises through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose jump to data showing a rise in wage growth in the United Kingdom, and at the same time, the FTSE 100 was enhanced by the bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage was the fastest since 2009 and provided estimates about the timing of an interest rate increase.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and had climbed up 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1,49% to 6.229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding shares in the market and made a jump of 20% after takeover bid from rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were after encouraging news from the competition for luxury goods group Richemont 0.9% higher.
Rich Mounts latest sales figures beat all expectations, and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry has reported - growth.
Shares in Glencore rose by 5% after the mining giant said that he had taken $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a drop of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs raised its estimate for the company to sell rating on "set.
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the company Sportbekleidungs for the half year pre-tax earnings of 46.6 million had reported.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers" could mean.
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost of the expansion plans could hit by JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer new jobs.

The Bieber-building: Lives their idol, whose posters galore in Szczecin, since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives, costs on the day just as much as their mom Ewa earns in half a year.

"I am fulfilling her a dream."
Compulsory school?

Pegida-poster brings Lebanese on potato Döner-idea
Potatoes or Döner?
It is both - and the potato Döner, which the Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the slogan "potatoes instead of Döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement has Alhay potatoes and meat, along with a stick.
The idea made him a poster at a Pegida-demonstration marked "potatoes instead of Döner," which he had seen on television by accident.
Since then, a barbecue skewer, which is equipped with meat and potatoes turns in his shop.
"That is" multicultural for the stomach, Alhay says.
The idea of the Lebanese has now register at the Patent Office in Munich.
She is protected, according to the authority recently as a utility model.

Only as much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.

Metcash Bodenständigkeits launches campaign to combat Aldi- invasion
Metcash tried to the IGA stores in front of an Aldi-gathering in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash Bodenständigkeits has launched a campaign to get the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia on the eve of a $700 million to defend Aldi's invasion.
While Aldi opening two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, is preparing to strengthen Metcash and IGA supermarkets, its relations with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA by mainstream marketing and marketing on social media, as well as events such as Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Eishersteller Simmo from Duns borough, which distributes samples in IGA stores and shopkeepers, cheap tickets for the South Australian Football League sell to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash further details of his defense strategy, published on 29 September, when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and sets its annual Investor Strategietag.
Much is at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia, nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA shops make up and higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the eastern states.
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia, compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi twelve months after opening its first markets will snatch away around five per cent of the grocery market in these two states and all existing players, but mainly independent retailers will take away sales.
A report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath estimated by Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016, could lose.
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year, 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery store and the amounts based on Metcash Metcashs high fixed costs around $13 million could profit before interest and taxes cost, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent poll by Roy Morgan found that IGA purchasers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs sales in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager today Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade, Metcash.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to the comments made by Mr Douglass.
But there is an assumption that a member of Metcash has contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGAS market share since 2010, from 18 percent to 14 percent, and revenue from Metcashs food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200-IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, while the operational deleveraging pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler refuses and is investing more than $150 million to date with Coles and sale prices on hundreds of products every week level and IGA retailers to improve their stores by improving faster growing fresh food and a better selection of private-label foods.
Metcashs CEO Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and store refurbishment programmes to drive up and hopes that the wholesaler in 2017 for the first time in four years, will return to profit growth.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy praise rather than criticism of his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is always referred to as "Special Ks," came the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after his opponent had to Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison twice to be separated by the referee, where Harrison stated: "Beat Wawrinka had Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen, as he smashed a tennis racquet, after a spasm of a potential US Open victory in Group foiled, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind Bernard an artist's in the Davis Cup semifinals against Great Britain.
"One thing that I really ereifere me is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was dragged into the dispute a little bit," Healy said.
He has broken a racket, because of a Krampfes lost in the US Open, but he is not the first player to make a racket out of frustration with himself has broken, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he was in the U.S. Open extremely well, even among the somewhat provocative circumstances, with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around them, he has a great family around them, and I think he was a little too strict.
He is a very mature 19 year old, he works very hard and he fits into the team, and so on, he has never been a problem with the other players, he will be respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he is in good form, he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to take Kyrgios in the major preliminary decision, which starts on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra, as part of a long term return to the team. "
"First, we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not" to all the controversy around [Kyrgios], Healy said.
And I think Nick has managed to rise very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, it is in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and all the criticism he deserves, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think, is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best thing for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closing the border, refugees back
Hungary declared a state of emergency and riegelte from the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and found that those who tried to come into the country illegally, all with the aim of halting the influx of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border, when hundreds of migrants have refrained in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown period in a strip of land along the road between the two checkpoints of countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations grew.
When a police helicopter was hovering above them, the migrants chanted "Open the borders!" And shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some were in protest food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister said that it was "unacceptable" that migrants from Hungary were returned, while more and more out of Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
It must take place in the coming days, talks with Brussels and other countries, "Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc at a contentious meeting in Brussels failed to agree on a common immigration policy.
However, the ministers agreed that the responsibility for 40,000 people to share the überrumpelten in Italy and Greece had taken refuge, they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states further 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary, would resume.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
Hungary, however, was not his hopes for a speedy action from Brussels or from its neighbours.
On Tuesday, the state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they could absperren roads and speeding up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants from the country - after it has finished a fence along the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates in the race, the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia, were used.
In recent months, many war refugees in Hungary from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a major bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted, however, that most of the arriving economic migrants who are in search of a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that contrasts starkly with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing the border or the Beschädigen of 4 meters (13 feet) high fence, which the government along the southern border with Serbia, wisely, a crime, these laws also set higher sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by the mass migration, the Hungarian government declared the Notzustand," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament must still technically still agree with the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but by Associated Press reporters saw heavily armed soldiers at the border with vehicles and dogs for days already.
Gyorgy Bakondi, national security adviser for Orban, said that authorities 45 people to attempt to cross the border was arrested, 15 others were already penetrated deeper into the country.
You come across as they damage the fence, they are now in police custody and commit crimes are accused under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning, two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a Zugwaggon arrived with barbed wire to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians, a small office in a metal container opened to edit the data of people and a lot of people put up there hineinzudrängen.
Around 20 could get it, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary, and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in a national poll halved
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against it.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent, while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent.
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency, the support of 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters that it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates say they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll has Clinton on a number of demographic groups, while Sanders achieved some gains.
Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates, but these protrusions have narrowed.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a large lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with double digit lead over the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the Democratic voters in the primaries across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations, and another 15 percent would only support them, because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly excited by it.
The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter of them would enthusiastically support.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters who say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say that about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want it to be the candidate, the most common response is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Of Clinton's supporters, their relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent) is mentioned.
Consent to deal with the problems and the eligibility will also be cited.
As the Vice President raises a potential for the presidency, 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries would like to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it.
If the primaries democratic voters are asked who would be the party for their second choice, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases, by 20 points, with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fünfundfünfzig percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month.
Biden, a second is by far in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most eligible" has risen.
Nevertheless, the question of what is more important for a candidate to call Democratic voters questions about the eligibility.
Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out for these voters in the primaries as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates for their party's primaries provide good results in a number of important characteristics of voters.
Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden performs best among the three candidates with honesty, Clinton's strength is in the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, more than twice as many say that Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters in the primaries, Clinton, Sanders and Biden are generally ideologically in line with their views.
In all of these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters had no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State, continue to be made, most Democratic voters in the primaries satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole.
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this issue was in March, shortly after the problem came to light, divided.
Most Americans said that the email controversy has no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of her has worsened.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for them, as a whole, among registered voters: Only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and less than 15 points since May.
62 percent of voters do not think it is an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters nationally to see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush are doing best in honesty.
A majority believes Sanders more than honest, but, like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is close behind in nationwide poll, Donald Trump
Ben Carson is located in the latest poll from CBS News / New York Times behind Donald Trump
The two candidates for half the support of voters in the new poll, and others, is now losing dramatically to stop
Republican voters nationwide continue to support Trump in large numbers, and the support is growing by 23% in the latest CBS poll from Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the poll on Tuesday.
But Carson shot over the same period, from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson is in demographic groups and Trump among Republican voters than with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is adrift, the deepest has fallen, from 10% support in the last month to 2% now.
The former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio with 6% in the third place.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6%, and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN / ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he ends up with 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The recent poll by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
With a view to one last week, ascending Carson Trump found some pages of blows for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a Campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees.
Even though peak values are measured only in the distance, bathing is enough for a trip to the Mediterranean to find more hot water.
A bath in the North and Baltic Sea at a maximum of 17 degrees is likely to be a relatively short time.
There is no longer in the sea: A maximum of 18 degrees, the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) informs.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures will continue to the Mediterranean: In the East, it even comes up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic Sea, they are in the top 25 degrees, 23 degrees in France.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood, with the death of a Baruch College newcomer charged
Almost two years after a student died during a bullying ritual of a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, will be filed murder charges against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013, brutal and delayed his journey to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand has been charged, and has been attacked repeatedly, while he tried to have a frozen field on an objective approach.
Finally, Mr. Deng complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood called the emergency number 911 after Deng was powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, according to the police.
However, they had the time to switch Deng's clothes to Google his symptoms and to contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood to obtain advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and the welfare of the Brotherhood were basically over that of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and he died of his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng were repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to the head, trunk and thigh.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood, and at least one student dies every year since 1970 in the harassment," said Douglas Fier, a lawyer who represents Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and its members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended a third degree charges of murder for the first five members.
Zweiunddreißig members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also accused of religious attacks and forming a criminal organisation.
"We want to make not only the people involved, but if there is an organization that has - officially or unofficially - sanctioned this, we will hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked their membership of the local group.
That will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike is coming, and the boom is flagging, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we do not know how long it takes and how long it will last.
In particular, the story offers little guidance for the economy in the end.
A recession came in just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates is often, but not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial assets.
As a result, representatives of the US central bank so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when to start raising interest rates, but rather on the period that is needed for the normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could see that the whole excitement has been exaggerated, possibly due to a rise in interest rates.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of" cheap money "," Julian Jessop, economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at very low levels, to the seismic shock that many seem to fear to lead.
That does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here's a look based on historical trends, as some areas of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the impact is not as dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend that asset yields 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be strangled, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank's analysts in a recent study of what happens after the Fed's interest rate increases.
More specifically, the market is usually in the past 35 years in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to raising interest rates, relatively flat over the next 250 days (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six previous cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle, and thus increase the yield begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often promote raising interest rates.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with a number of conditions, which did not exist before and which could hasten a recession.
It is very noteworthy that GDP is close to its lowest point in a rate hike by the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank's nominal GDP stood at the 118 rate hikes only twice since 1950 under 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent, only a few that will last and are waiting for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed only 1.5 percent.
Interest rate increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Participants throughout the year to a rate hike by the Fed have been taken, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee addressed this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that an increase in the FOMC could approve this session, the futures trading is only a probability of 25%.
"In our study have all increased cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession highs very soon after the start of the recovery in the shadows asked," according to the report.
In contrast, this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest, which the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are now 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, because the market is anticipating a rate hike, and similar to the pattern rather than on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks, if they change their strategic course.
With bond yields seem to change direction, as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increasing bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
By Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yielding bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious, to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, European fixed income at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets are already on the Fed's policy and expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market to the prospect of tighter monetary policy has changed," she wrote.
Short term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and the volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market if the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large companies that do most of their business in the US, will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, and the financing of its debt.
"History shows that" quality "stocks tend, three months after an initial rate hike to respond very positively," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets have surpassed companies with weak balance sheets for each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares exceeded their counterparts with low quality (by an average of 4 percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most, Goldman said.
Outside the pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, although experts are divided on how quickly it will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for its "dumbing down."
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He was also on the BBC Music Awards and said that she only imitated The bathrooms smelt
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins grabbed the show The Voice, and said that this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, a leading member of parliament and adds new pressure on the broadcaster claims to prove that he is doing something that doesn't do the private broadcasters.
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said the BBC bosses that public service radio station "verdumme" and increasingly no longer to distinguish from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I use the word" verdummen "does not like - but it seems to turn to Classic FM," he said.
He was also on the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, seem to be The bathrooms smelt only under a different name.
So if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you really only "imitate what is already on the market, said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director General dismissed the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors, when it comes to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, which I will learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and making music that is truly unmatched.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, finding new music and new works, I think it is really important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, Radio 3 controller Alan facilities that needs to be worked harder to engage the audience argued the BBC than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC production, which during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture, media and sport, came under fire for its commercial rivals to the feet.
The Tory MP Damien Collins, The Voice - the musical talent show on the BBC, the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million has been purchased.
You can see why this program is often discussed, because it is not original, and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - "in a special BBC way" was produced.
He added that he hoped the company "is a hit from our own stable" when it run the next time an entertainment series.
However, he refused to the appointment of another series of The Voice in the future to exclude or bill payer's money for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose in August, the slowest and the Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there were seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month, it was the lowest result since records began in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago, through the use of mobile phones to shop
Experts believe that the spending has slowed the Black Friday in November
For more than a decade, the virtual shopping geboomt, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say that there are now signs that the online sales stagnate after new figures, only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total spending for August showed the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures, only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 indicated
"If you look at the growth rate for the previous years and go back to 2000, then it has developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales increased to three years ago, when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people were able to shop online and that people were able to do so in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now it is leveling off, and we will probably see that the growth.
"The Black Friday phenomenon, which has been imported from America, as a reason for declining sales quotes.
Experts believe that buyers their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, rallied five times the average number of buyers to their computers in order to make their bargains, and some retailers "websites plummeted.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyers are fighting for bargains that could deter buyers to make purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that slightly more than £1 was spent by £5 spending online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines will be more than a third of the purchases on web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buying clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.

The bodies of 29 deaths are borne by Muslims in the first Begräbnissen in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia is part of the collapse of the huge Saudischen Bin Laden Group to load

Hundreds of Muslims gathered in 29 of the victims were paraded through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca Grand Mosque.
Trauernde filled, mostly dressed in white, the route to pay their respects, as the first of the dead on their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The funeral procession moved over at the holy site, where only days before a building crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque, and then to the prayer.
The bodies were released for the funeral, as the Saudi King about the construction of the Bin Laden family, because of the disaster, which also left 394 wounded, imposed a sanction.
The bodies of 29 Betern who were killed when a crane by the Great Central Mosque Mecca, were paraded through the streets.

Mr Akram was a mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage in the Great.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Haddsch to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city, will continue.
Today, King Salman said that Bin-Laden Group would have the arm of the crane is not supposed to leave when he was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, the state Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin-Laden group was responsible for the collapse.

Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hajj, which will take place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has no statements about the collapse of a crane, and their representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also chided the group not because of current security measures and because she had not cooperated with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mekkas Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project, it's by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family for decades, is linked to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia and major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son, who in the 1990s was expropriated by the family.
The crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain, just a few days before arrival of millions in the UK, the pilgrimage at least once in a lifetime of every healthy Muslim is required.
Officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials ordered that £1 million rial (174.000) are to be paid to the families of those killed and injured in the same amount of money in the long term.
Other injuries will receive half of that amount.
B & Q boss says that the era of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen, Veronique Laury says
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has rise behind
This means that 200 other Screwfix outlets, which aim to craft to be opened
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q stores nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that British their hammers and brush set down in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home
If you are adept with a hammer or a brush for painting of walls, it now seems to belong to a minority.
Because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, new chief executive of Kingfisher, the DIY chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, offering the services at budget prices is now obsolete.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix shops for artisans and to close 60 B & Q stores.
Mrs Laury said she wanted more women in B & Q stores, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions are made by women in the shop.
At the moment, the men predominate among employees.
She said it was necessary to make the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men in our stores.
We need to move it more towards a balance.
Basically, the half of our customers are women, with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision making.
Mrs Laury, one of only five women at the top of one of Britain's leading companies listed in the FTSE100 index is also has its top team umstruktiert, an equal number of men and women in leadership positions to reflect.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied just 50 percent of the team with women, including its CEO and CFO.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a deliberate decision - diversity is an important issue.
It was not difficult to find good women to our board.
Kingfisher announced a drop in half year profit and sales after the group schulterte the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend is Kingfisher, which owns B & Q and northern, 200 new stores.
Officials from Aich / Dob due to infidelity in court
The Regional Court of Klagenfurt, on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball-deputy master Aich / Dob due to infidelity and tax evasion to account.
The defendants acknowledged not guilty.
One of them was also accused of abuse of power.
This accusation, he has been acquitted by a court in May.
The current process was postponed.
According to Attorney General Robert Riffel had crystallized in the preliminary examination that the defendants in the years 2006 to 2011 money from club accounts that they were allowed to scheduling their functions, used for private purposes.
He puts the damage with around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also accused of financial crimes.
This fact, the chairman of the Schöffensenats, Judge Michaela Sanin from arbitration.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
The Verwurf of infidelity, the defense stated that a fortune to be part of the club at any time.
Sports officials would only offset expenses and for the sports club, they have been operating from 1982 to 2011, and in which they have invested a lot of time and money, brought out of the debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to approximately 600,000 Schilling (approximately 44,000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: We run the club or we lock too?," one of the defendants in the bread work great auditor told the Financial District.
With his colleague and co, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We have vorgeschossen money, our life insurance as collateral in the bank," he said at the hearing.
With the club, you can manage the money freely, it may only be made no debts had been agreed.
Furthermore, with adequate financial success - the retroactive payment of allowances have been decided until 1991.
That is why we have a share of the allowances until years later, in 2003, when an increase in the account had been paid.
Therefore, package and does not provide detail on rail, the former coordinator explained the transactions.
The accounts and savings books jointly managed by the two defendants, the second defendant said.
Why do the payments the club have not been disclosed in detail, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the detail of the's, it was only the freedom of debt, according to the answer.
When 2011 began in the year against an official investigation for abuse of office, a figure of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club.
These were reserves, said the defendants.
The investment account was in the name of the second defendant, and, according to his statement was not known to the club.
"Why?" Asked the judge.
The respondents knew no answer for a long time.
Then, finally, he said that he believed that this was the best for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known any of that money, the prosecutor said.
The Mitangeklagte had been informed, justified the official.
This transfer was formulated as "damage reparation."
Why Schadensgutmachung?, judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he had been dissatisfied with this wording, because the damage is never outside the club.
But what should I do if the lawyer says: "With all of you are off the hook."
"I am a legal representative?" He asked.
Furthermore, the official said he had never taken a penny of salary, for he had just kilometres of money and diets.
On diets, he asked the association of 1,000 euros per month, but the actual cost was much higher, he added.
Detailed records of the early years, the defendants were not present.
They had been stored after an audit in which everything has been judged to be correct, no longer, she said.
Mileage allowance, the second defendant had obtained.
All Behebungen are done in cash, so he had to drive from his home to the bank of international market after Bleiburg, he said in his statement.
The main negotiations will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.

The decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world watched when the US Federal Reserve in two days on Wednesday and Thursday, comes together to make the important decision to make, whether for the first time in nearly a decade, the interest rates will be raised or not.
A survey of 80 economists who were interviewed by Reuters, found that a little more than half that only last week was of the opinion that the Fed will do so, now that the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It is a historic event, because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero.
"For the first time, we are moving towards a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and a process of normalisation of interest rates will start," said Angel Ubide, Senior staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance, trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation.
However, the Fed can ignore the less rosy view of global conditions.
She has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the evidence suggests that the odds are against such a move.
The decision is expected at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday will be announced
Shooter at the Delta State University left a letter of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and later in the day, before he wrote his colleagues shot and killed Shannon Lamb - a note to say that he "fed up" with the first murder and he wanted to know "can make it reversed," authorities said on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, the emergency number at 10: 00 on Monday morning, calling upon
And said he had shot and killed someone to someone.
Lamb said the employee of the emergency call centre that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" in the house, but no one is "upset," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller to his name, but he was not him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, said: "I am so sorry, I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me. "
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police umzingelten him.
University President William upon said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but, of course, "there was something in Mr Lambs idea."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb reportedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information" no evidence for a "triangular relationship."
Prentiss was described by Shawn O 'Steen, who testified that they were married for about seven years, as a "good man."
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
"Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was" devastated. "
He said that her daughter had Prentiss "absolute best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to testimony by Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning met, for about three years with lamb.
"They always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that lamb phoned relatives at one point on Monday to tell them, "he will not go to jail."
When police heard him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot and ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb was in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University with a doctorate, as Lau tells his life on the website of the university.

Eurowings, Lufthansa is transforming the company
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring.
Half a billion euros a year to the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization.
150 of the world's roughly 1,000 executives of the corporate restructuring will cost jobs.
With the pilot close, however, and there are new negotiations.
Lufthansa is expanding its business structure and enhances the cheap subsidiary Eurowings.
The goal of the realignment is a result of contribution of around 500 million euros a year in cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, there is no future in the Lufthansa board more for the passenger business.
The budget airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
The chief executive Carsten Spohr team Karl Ulrich Garnadt in the future will be responsible for Eurowings.
With the Neuaufstellung Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, which the company wants to continue to compete with Ryanair and Easyjet.
So far, the organisation of the 120 000 people strong company was complex.
The airlines were operating under the umbrella of the Passenger Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United may not play for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered during the Champions League defeat by Manchester at PSV Eindhoven a double fracture of his right leg.
While this brought the left side defenders cry and it will be ruled out for at least six months from the game, Louis van Gaal is hopeful that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after the 20 year old Shaw in the PSV area had collapsed.
He was dealt with nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be published tomorrow, or perhaps a day later, and then operates in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it is very difficult and then great, and then this happens.
In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He wept.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
I hope that he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a Elfmeters.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, has not punished the Mexicans.
Van Gaal assumed that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for themselves when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very serious attack with both feet.
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "Thank you all for your messages, words can't describe how broken I am, my road to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
That is what Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw: The defeat at PSV
The England defender has with the European Championship in France, an additional incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV's trainer, said: "It is a very serious violation."
If a player leaves with this type of injury, are all very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico against Van Gaals Holland team played at the World Cup in 2014.
"It is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and then when you hear that it is a very serious violation, it is not good," Cocu said.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see the ball, which was in a different direction, so that it looked as if he had touched him [Moreno], but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In her interview with SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel very bad, I am so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital - after a foul play by Chris Smalling.
Certainly, David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is one thing to learn about all parents: If your child loves a book, it will not be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.
As a provider of childcare systems was asked, his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax, published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr. /.
It is a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a message on the website of the company Super Camps, and continues: "It was funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I read to my children, because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, but a summary of the film version of 2012 reflects the new characters and details added to the relatively short text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all the nature is gone, and even the air is a commodity, hopes a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams to win by their desire to see a real tree, fulfilled," reads one, a love interest was Dr. /, whose real name was Theodor / hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that weren't suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron sometimes reads like the summary of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database website will be presented and thus begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, hopes a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams of winning."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron, the plot of the book is so little known, hears a unbenannter boy, as the local environment through the avaricious, trees cases, knitting Thneed Once-ler, despite the protests of the named Lorax, Hock, schnurrbärtigen, "which speaks on behalf of the trees," will be devastated.
Most likely, it was such a relatively low PR task delegated to a helper, The Lorax 20 times in a row is not a child read.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text of Cameron's constituency office is likely to come.
Super Camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but had no further immediate comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it is still difficult
On Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but if the squad, which was selected for the tour of England, is a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat and not on my card.
I would not rule out a victory.
Alastair Cook's side is probably less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin-player in the Batting-list, and the community spirit is strong; they will not bear scars of 2012, only a youthful positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali as a spin Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, is an option for the attack.
Related news: Adam Lyth leaves England's Test squad and will be replaced by Alex champions.
The decision to leave out Adam Lyth, of course, is to analyze me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven Tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and that this led to the nomination - and I have said this before - players are their own best chooser.
A long time ago, it would have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control over its own destiny.
Hopefully, if he beats out other runs for Yorkshire, another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he is not so good services, and it does not surprise me; he is first and foremost a team man.
The question of how much time a test shot man gets to his character, is difficult.
Lyth had seven chances - such as Sam Robson got in front of him - while Nick Compton nine.
Compton was only got the chance to play home and away.
The only criticism I can make is that England was first used in the Caribbean - Jonathan routine when Lyth in top shape - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex champions comes in, and he is a hit man, whom I have high.
He is an X Factor cricketers what we saw Yorkshire early this season, when he 236 against us on the Trent Bridge pitch achieved what hit us.
He must be at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but of course it depends on the team's position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beat alongside Cook, with an extra-spin Bowler provide and would receive four Quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a man can't go there, and that Hendrix has already shown that he is a devil guy of cricket players.
Moeen may have done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is a big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an opener.
He has made three hundred runs immediately and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he has really impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there is a large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the England team has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience, having played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood for the white ball phase of the tour, and brings energy and a strong commitment to the setup.
I always felt that he was for the international cricket competition is created, as a player or as a coach, and how he has Mahela insights that we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the dressing room, even if the messages are in line with the previously said.
Collys teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, is not in the One Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and, for my part, I have no problem with that.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team on the plate does not determine the timetable.
And you have to remember that their jobs depend on the players from the results.
Such decisions are not with a light heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = Britain's exit from the EU) could rise to win when the economy by the year 2017 gets into a slump
David Cameron's crude Neuverhandlungs strategy to keep Britain in the EU, with each day deeper into trouble, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as leader of Labour or the Tuc who are falling sharply due to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn's and Nigel Farage's.
A European diplomat friend said the other day that some member states, so deeply enmeshed in various crises, such as the EU, it is now time, and not always from their own guilt, Britain's own agenda with divided concessions and disruptive changes that they often do not want to be satisfied.
In Brighton, the Tuc decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it when they threaten the social protection.
We could also have Dave and Georges Selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reform.
It is always about me.
My European friend who is an outside view of Britain inside the EU tent wishes - "Let us not only with France," says Berlin - and hints that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals has come to the point where it is no matter to them, whether we stay or go.
Germany's carefully measured Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but it has been 10 years in power, and the office wants to leave before it looks bad for them, as ausharrenden like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16 is the excessively long).
France's François Hollande looks back on his reelection or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a declining force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain is a left.
It is hard to imagine that they will get a leg bent to help the Selfie-British, whose energy should be used more, Scotland's exit from the UK to prevent - something they may not want to, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, possibly even planning some kind of ministers deliberately unhelpful comments, the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017, in order to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bust," and "Britain has won nothing of value out of the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at their expense and the EU sceptics, the oligarchy of the press barons, as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn were not, however, that our entry in 1973, with a ratio of 2: 1.
You can be weak to Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunists, who has a reputation as a "straight" EU banana Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s, it has made.
For all its craziness Ed Miliband knew who were his enemies.
This included a medley of tax for fearing the rogue, phone hack of foreigners and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought much about it, but noted that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distributes bananas to distract him, rather than being on his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairianer than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum, because Blair had not adopted the principle of the EU constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened the door for him.
The press has never forgiven him for that.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me on Monday in Westminster, a friendly pat on the back, I told him that he had no time for me to waste - seems in danger of Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch 80's strategy to repeat a mistake then and now.
It may be, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy in order to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew moroccan, whose BBC-sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyns official position on Europe - I express it nicely - in the development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukips traditional blue dye-trend and the wilder climes of Tories Klein Engländerismus everyone can say 'yes' to do so.
It is to admit what Hilary Benn said, "A, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and on television this week, when the Scout fought in it, not that provocative Corbyns appointment of John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father tried to do on television, disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without having to go too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilarys fight was even more attractive.
But struggling to remain "under any circumstances" - Benns - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his colleagues and MPs after all the reports on their conclave on Monday evening.
Whatever the consists bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he has even moved me - news discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock and, above all, in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe, which allows him to Labour's support in the referendum campaign as a matter of course, as McDonnell, it said.
Certainly Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyns fundamental ambiguity to EU membership - in line with the Bennite Belagerungs economy, its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small differences, a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC is launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home.
Why Paris or Berlin should waste political capital - they have also distrustful voters - to make concessions to the British, if anything can be so pointless?
The US is already pretty disappointed by the lack of military service in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction of the Tory government in power, which I start on Monday was reminded of something that is called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Allegations of a publicly funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined Lancet, by the Public Health England (PHE) in her report on e-cigarettes used evidence.
PHE published the "principle" report last month and describes him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have called into question the reliability of the data, and highlighted the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis," based on the PHE its main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the allegations "on stone or sand build."
Martin McKee, professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" on a detailed review of the evidence and the modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were summoned to a model of a multiple criteria and decision analysis (Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to develop their opinions about the damage caused by various nicotine-containing products to lead to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Cape, said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health, the managing director of British American Tobacco to previously means (BAT) to obtain an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that funds from an e-cigarette-maker, but not the funding, according to reports by the tobacco company Philip Morris International is said to have received, she added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the panel will not be delivered, but there are several popular e-cigarette champions, some of which is also an industry funding in the paper.
Some of the other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting, also took the tobacco by PHE.
The research group "significantly," admits that there is a lack of hard evidence, the damage of most products on most criteria, "said McKee and Cape.
But none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report.
McKee and Cape, said that the allegations of PHE that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes as a way to smoke for children or serve smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said that it has responded to the allegations by BMJ earlier.
He said: "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we still have to study the long term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from diseases related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion a year.
The clear submission of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage that will be caused by smoking, and we meet our national competence.
The BBC should give up Eastenders, former head of Channel 4 says
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop programmes such as Eastenders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that no other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for public service programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, solid window against the most popular shows of their rivals and placing of channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC director general, Tony Hall, said that the company in partnership with other organisations to do, Johnson said that he spent six years in his time at Channel 4 have tried, without success, to get in touch with the BBC.
"I have a problem with the idea that the BBC has commissioned programmes or broadcasts, which also clearly not subsidized rivals would be shown," said Johnson, the House of Lords communications committee, as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I think is not the medium or long term is a good idea, you should at least give its production to programs that others are doing or not.
Send The Voice in a prime time slot because they want to reach the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show, this is a joke, it's ridiculous, of course, it is nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax funding programs that could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a programme, Eastenders is another, admittedly, both own productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for.
I try to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur, the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is to blame for the pursuit of ratings, "due to the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows are what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, and in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like Eastenders.
Johnson said that the more public service niche programs "to BBC4 should go where you can pretty much do not measure the audience, but they do their job, and they can argue when their hypocritical missions to justify a £4 billion broadcasting fees go," Well, of course, we have all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "
Put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them.
The broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from that.
Of course, they all think we all think that for £150 per year, here is a great value, but for people who have the £150 for a lot of money, whether that is true wonder, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said very little about the BBC production would now officially classified as an education - he said that 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should be on the public television stations in Australia and Canada, take an example that change to "inform, educate and entertain."
On the question of partnerships Elstein, the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and make alliances with commercial channels said to make everything available online.
"Sono Genetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses that are too high for human hearing frequencies to be heard.
The impetus to work through the involvement of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on this subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure called sono Genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to create a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside of the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the birth Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure will one day replace the deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found that the ultrasonic waves that penetrate into the worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures that TRP-4 ion channels are called and in the cell membranes of some of the worms are found.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned to, according to a report in Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasonic controlled nematodes, genetically modified Chalasani the worms in such a way that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels.
If he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the micro vesicles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the revised motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with Opto Genetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to neurons with pulses of light on and off.
But Chalasani said that sono Genetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain needs to be sent down to low frequency ultrasonic waves can freely pass through tissue and into the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible that the human neurons were temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments to make," said Chalasani.
Other applications could be to muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The ads disgrace Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International anti-arms fairs video.
Dreadful murderers-drones!
Ankle zerschmetternde leg shackles!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock sticks, causing agonising pain, but left no trace.
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's biggest arms fair is a combative parody, which was produced by Amnesty International, the willingness of the British government in the spotlight to bring weapons to repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International: Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands to bestow gifts.

But a separate campaign also leads to a lot of posters at bus stops and metro-trains to see and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Go from 15 to 18 September, with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads the characters of London Underground and the hallmarks of DLR line, which converts the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will travel with the DLR... customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Dismaland Banksys.
A group called Special Patrol Group helped the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 -Pack of Inbusschlüsseln, claiming that "access to around a third of bus stops and advertising space on the planet gain."
Transport for London is the Plaka animal "vandalism" not funny.
One of the parody ads, which was produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will be more critical and try to bring political work for the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists make themselves with activists in protest movements to work and say that they have to go out into the real world, so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms-posters greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, the nonprofit with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever was surprised at the silence around the advertising of the arms fair - there was a lacuna in the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "We give them the campaign that they are trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic dodgy firms advertising, but "by the einbläuen with bright colors and animation, it remains more liable."
"They have done a fantastic job in helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices to raise at the show," says Tom Davies, of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not traded on our doorstep is illegal.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair dates from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors fantastically euphemistische products bestow gifts.

This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead, the outstanding to reproduce effects inside the target returns."

Eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
Eleven years ago I moved and even forgotten 19-year old into student housing, still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the strained smile of those who I have annoyed - and to the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned, can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student residences range from slightly fraught and absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to tell schwatzen: People where you come from and where you've taken sabbatical where you are in relation to Corbyn and why you love Marmite "frankly neither hate nor because seriously guys, it's just a yeast extract hahaha," I am in my room.
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Do questions and they show interest.
It draws the conversation and helps you to identify the people who you would like as opposed to those with whom you do not speak, even if your eyelashes were on fire and that fire extinguishers.
Let people.
The rooms of people turning into beverage receptions, movie night venues and local venues, but they are also the places where people dress up and back into their underwear.
Related to this: You do not need to start out at the university with a relationship
Introverted get a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many students residences form a room-to-room-pedestrian culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be a hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say: "I love you, and I want to continue our friendship, but you have to go away, so I get the energy that I have used for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a Man is exhausted by sociability - and it will send an SMS knocking him.
Speaking of knock: You do it.
A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation.
He saw a number of things.
Close friendship with baking.
Since the university at the height of the Back-mania start is the knock on the doors of people with a plate full of Brownies, less strange than the greeting of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, I gave you a little baked, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Homemade to offer is a good way to close friendships.
Her housemates feel obliged to talk and will probably end up associating your face with a tasty morsel.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed up lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people are asleep when you knock.
To steal food, is a common crime in student residence halls.
Of course, the mouth of chicken is a theft, but it is the capture of a drop Milchs for your tea?
Check it with the dairy owners.
The chances are good that they say to themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your belongings, it is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my resident, who added their milk a detergent to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
You should not make noise, which prevents people from sleeping or from work.
It is not just a question of being a decent man, but that you are in the truest sense of the proverb to the people who are sitting in a glass house.
A girl on my floor asked their neighbours to ask them whether it is something a little quieter drum & bass, because there are three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They have responded with even more loud music.
When she finally stopped at 5 p.m., they left their neighbours are grateful to sleep two hours before they had their own music blaring, completed her door and went to her three hours of testing.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen to occupy the same student housing?
On the other hand, it would not be abysmally embarrassing if you are a resident of your future Ehepartnerin, special to separate them, and then they have to look at every day and perhaps see how it moves across all common friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a resident is definitely not your future Ehepartnerin try, at least, persuade your abdomen a little common sense.
Leave in the exciting moment when you realize that someone has his keys in his room not verschlossenem, the boundary between having fun appealed and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it takes only moments before he becomes a boomerang.
Submit by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about security - but you never to flood someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
They lock their doors, and they put their keys in a glass of water, then place in the freezer - but you are tackern their possessions on the ceiling, no more than twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Wohnhraum need not only refugees, but also the single mother and low earners."
"I show how you still can build cheap and good," says the 44-year old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will push for the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created: He builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push for the housing market.
What solution you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms have no sustainability.
Because the people are, to a large extent.
In light of the refugee flow, we also need enough housing over the next few decades.
A very commonplace, three storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs at least.
It facilitates the integration.
It is different when you are under the people in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses that were built in the pilot project, consists of three apartments, each for four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I go back.
Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000, without a plot.
This is manageable.
Took six months of construction.
That is appropriate.
The building regulations have complicated their plans?
Gildner: Building, I have learned through my project.
Particularly complicated, it is always the impending special sword of Damocles and pitch regulation.
Creepy. "
Still, it is assumed that anyone who creates a terraced house with three apartments, needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities of the place is missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents responded to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What is definitely not true.
But you do not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It is true that we have had over the last five years, a construction boom in Germany, but built luxury apartments that can afford a little more.
My project is the message, the ordinary people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earners.
I'll show how you can still build cheap and good.
That is what it is all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
Ios 9: How do you get the new iPhone operating system, when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by the Recruitment app, go to "General" and then "Software Update."
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some are encountered after the installation of problems, because they receive an error message that says that "software update failed."
To get around the problem, users are encouraged to wait either, dates back to the rush or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.
That may mean the deletion of apps to make room, but Apple has made it less likely by the streamlining of the update, and it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then install them again once the process is complete.
It is worthwhile to ensure that your phone is charged during the upgrade, or is located near a battery charger, so that the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not mean that the update will continue because the phone could possibly halfway switches off and lead to a breakdown of the update.

Rosbergs only motto: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the battle for the world title in Formula 1 against his clear leading Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton just a motto: "Full attack."
The second stressed before the start of the crucial seven overseas race, "that I had nothing to lose."
53 points separate the vice world champion before after separate in Singapore this Sunday from titleholders and two-champion Hamilton.
The Briton has won seven of the previous 12 races of the season and takes the flood lights in the city state as well as a favorite.
In 2009, and last year, the 30 year old Briton was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have on the Grand Prix of Singapore, is still unclear.
For days, a brown haze hangs over the city, caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissingen Chess Club has a prominent member of
The chess club, which was founded three months ago, "Bad Kissingen chess players," added another member in its ranks, the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member of the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who was more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for cure.
Gauselmann is winner of the Federal Service Cross, 1st class and honorary citizen of the city Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen Gauselmann supported with a donation that Chairman Alfred Klein.
Thus, it is possible to include chess players who do not have the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wants that membership in the chess club and friendly contact with the Tennis Club "Rot Weiss" as an expression of his commitment to the city.
The office is seeking direct contact
Saludis and the old centre of Antoni pen has been under the cloak of social foundation together and the Graf-Stauffenberg Square opened a new focal point.
In addition to discussions, you can also take part in courses.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More specifically to the Graf-Stauffenberg Square.
There is a new district office was recently opened.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and Ratsuchende immediately receive information on issues such as maintenance, insurance, or services of health and care schemes.
For years, we note with our outpatient care service that carers are often left alone.
There are an infinite number of questions.
"Many achievements of funds are often not used because of the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood," the new house mistress Jutta Weigand, who is a former divisional director Antoni aid for the pen and the public hospital and outpatient services, "Amadeus" explained.
In addition to the deliberations of the new district office also offers prevention, health and wellness.
This includes the Saludis was taken on board.
Therefore, you can take advantage of additional services such as fall prevention, memory training or physical therapy.
The offers from the senior center and the Saludis complement each other.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The senior center for care and maintenance," Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis described.
The reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city centre, both managing directors are particularly in the demographic change.
Because it makes a good local infrastructure in the various districts of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) said at the inauguration ceremony, dedicate the district office of loneliness in old age: "There are a number of events and offers on the program and invite them to a regular sit."
Thus the social foundation, making a major contribution that seniors can live independently and effectively as possible in their familiar surroundings.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.

Viennese architect Karl Mang 92-died
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92 years, as the Kuenstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang the Kuenstlerhaus lose an honorary member, and at the same time, "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna," as it was said in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied during and after the Second World War architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952, he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and director of the Institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute for design.
In the 1980s, he was with the establishment of the treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the renovation of the Palais Lobkowitz in the Austrian Theater Museum.

"We want to get to know the family over the years and support."
He also see as an advantage, soon to be his own boss.
And so it was agreed that the Müller's bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live over Vilsen.
The double father Frank Müller is also grew up, his medical studies in Hanover stations in several medical practices and hospitals in Sulingen, Britain Castle and Rotenburg.

Some 2,000 patients according to Silvia Müller-Gongoll Felstehausen each quarter into practice, in the northern German average practice, there are about 500.
In Norse village, there is another GP practice.
A positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains loud Ursel Felstehausen in asen village.
If a successor had been found, they would also be gone.
Anyone who visited Müller's appointment looks to continue, especially in familiar faces: The seven medical workers and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
With their departure ends an era in asen village, after all, the doctors have practised there for 30 years.
"At the beginning, we had only two rooms, enduring Ursel Felstehausen recalls.
They feel a little bit of nostalgia for the long term.
"But we live even further in high moorland and many patients will see even more intense," says the interni Tin.
Her husband laughingly adds: "We have a 6000-square meter plot."
"So far, I have always pushed myself to gardening, now it could be different."

Croatia: "We are the refugees."
"Now the controls are also on our southern border, high risks," said Home Secretary Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The checks at the Hungarian border, remain at the same time.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an application for asylum, this could also, of course, "".
The care and safety of the people stand in the foreground.
But it is also clear that "we need clear signals," said the minister.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, not on the Austro-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering "corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wants to allow refugees to travel on to Austria and Germany, and may also create corridors for the refugees.
Just saw this interior minister, Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable," Slovenia will actually intensify the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary.
The border with Croatia is an external border of the Schengen area, by contrast, already heavily controlled.
As the minister stressed that Slovenia is to seal its borders to refugees.
"Every EU member has to fill out its obligations, otherwise the system may not work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced that the first refugees had already tried during the night hours on Tuesday to enter in the Ostkroatien Tovarnik / Sid over to evade the registration.
The Croatian police failed to take them in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media constantly police vehicles with new refugees arrive in the Croatian Tovarnik since then.
It is mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Also, emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country with around 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko project said.
There are buses from Presevo, on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which has been brought to the Hungarian border, migrants were diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported unanimously on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, denied that she had the Anweise people to follow certain routes: "Neither we, nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to media reports, however, is the first bus arrived in the morning with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Sid, in the course of the day, more buses were expected.
On Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants were all night, around 500 kilometres away from the Macedonian border with Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed down, so the police told us that we are supposed to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
Thus, it might actually have already predicted by observers to postpone the previous Balkan Route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary at a nearby stretch a little further west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive opportunities for border control."
Croatia's Interior Minister project had previously stressed that his country had prepared in the event of a large influx of refugees corresponding plans for possible emergency situations.
He gave no details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member "comprehensive opportunities for border control.
We carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia is part of that, since 2007, the EU partners represent the country consistently since a testimonial to what the standard of border controls.
On the Serb side, about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the previous night at the Horgos border crossing that leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg continue to remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border, is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local eye in Horgos: He thought the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed, is premature.
Currently, it would not be very high numbers of refugees.
It could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Migrant workers - dangerous - alternative routes rates
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps showing alternative routes are drawn by Croatia.
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless, however: In parts of the border area, there are also 20 years after the end of the war in Croatia is still not cleared minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of Minenräumern was sent to the border region.

Ecumenical hospice help Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz brisk business.

The head of the Ecumenical hospice care is the passerby also available for questions and discussions, such as the volunteer staff.
While a passerby some spontaneous attacks on the chalk and the phrase "yes my life," read "to go" with the campers from the United States, "" stop the war "or" not suffer "added, while others are short, read, I say phrases like" have not so far "and then continue.

FedEx mixed results, financial outlook for 2016 reduced
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and Liefer giant lowered its profit outlook for the full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to about 55,000 seasonal workers hired for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The shares fell more than 2.5 percent in Premarket trading about 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting, according to a survey by FactSet 10,84 $.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which will amount to an average of 4.9 percent and effectively on 4 January and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages, which are collected from November.
The company said that it expects, however, that the result compared to the previous year, due to lower costs, higher revenues and because of the growth in online trading will increase.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid returns, if one takes the weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade, into account."
The plans for the holidays and employment were a day later than those of rival UPS announced that plans to 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2,42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which predicted twelve analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12,23 billion.
FedEx has in recent years, a decline in international priority shipment, the sales in its unity express delivery to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales increased by 29 percent in the ground transportation, but operating profit was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and even insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
The Premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell to $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150,15.
On Tuesday, it closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June.
At its most anticipated meeting in Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week around a 27-foot-Honduras mahogany table, to decide whether it is time for the first time in almost a decade to raise the federal funds rate.
Loom above them at one end of the ornate, two storey sitting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues, the economic interests of the nation above all other things to do.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximizing the US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.
And the third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them, it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to start, from the unprecedented stimulus in the short term interest rate close to zero since late 2008 to be weaned.
Although most of the economic data show that it is solid, the recent turmoil in global financial markets, the already cautious Fed officials are fearful that this volatility by increasing the interest rates on federal bonds to increase - and it is only about a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they" observe, Lindsey M. Piegza, Chefökonomin at the brokerage firm, said Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext to increase the interest rate is not the increased uncertainty to wait around the global market enough justification to continue," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do what confuses itself in the financial market.
About half of the economists who were recently surveyed by Bloomberg, have predicted a rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets are expecting the Fed wait, with a key indicator that shows only a 30% chance of an increase.
This points to a decline in the stock market, if the Fed raises rates, unless the strategists would soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far removed.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228,89 points, or 1.4% to 16.599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed's policy maintains the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raise rates would be at this stage, "he said.
If it does, "they would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets, so that they are not in panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Even a month ago, the Fed seemed to be well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.
Yellen had in the spring and early summer, said that this year, despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be required to expect an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and close to the levels that the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation persistently below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed officials said that the main reason for the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.
"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
But the financial markets around the world zuckten at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell in May by more than 16% below its record high, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, while the Dow is now down by almost 10% below the high in May.
Representatives for the Fed's influence the market turbulence, the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks had not occurred, they would attract the reins at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that it will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the impact.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so technically it should not be involved in their decision making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere mention of the former leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could narrow their monetary expansion, "" triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, from the Fed's representatives can be expected to not only monitor the developments elsewhere, but also with other central banks and expert advice to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision is "more art than science," Zachary Kara Bell, head of global strategy, said of the asset management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., said this month that the Fed "a history of overreaction on financial market movements that do not seem to with the economic fundamentals are linked."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, is campaigning for a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings, "despite limited visible impact on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed's representatives made these cuts.
The Fed should only be aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis, such as the market collapse of 2008 first, Adam S. Posen, a former member of the committee, said the interest rate set by the Bank of England.
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level, he said.
"They will certainly not get into the situation where they fear a rise in interest rates, because the markets are" understandably upset, Poznan, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not to mention the financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think that they should jump ahead of time.

Brazil's Rio Grande pädiatrische society promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS tried, in a shocking way to educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding, it does so with the presentation of images of babies who suck on breasts that are painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements will be pregnant women and young mothers, their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that should make mothers.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protecting them against the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.

And he made an exception.
The roof for solar system may be flatter.
Plans for the long awaited turn buildings at the Bern Rieder sports grounds are progressing step by step: In a recent City Council meeting, the finalised Bauantrag was unanimously approved without much discussion.

The "liberation" was again the roof slope, which should be prescribed for energetic reasons - other than the construction plan - under ten degrees.
The volume of the hall will be considerably reduced.
Therefore, a "liberation" was necessary because the development plan allows for the roof, with no exceptions, "" the Bern Rieder council usually do on exemption applications more restrictive.
The gym buildings, it is not a recurring project: "We are creating a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The sports structures at the centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Ried Bern.

Also, more and more refugees are looking for an affordable accommodation.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
The social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution battles on the German housing market have started a long time ago.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many cities.
They compete with low-income citizens the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would need to be built every year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Alliance "social housing associations comes."
By comparison, this year 260,000 units will be finished in Germany.
With 140,000 homes are missing.
Refugees are required for the first three months of their stay, no longer to live as asylum seekers in a reception.
Many come to the housing market and a fall in the long queues in front of the apartments.
According to the German Federal Statistical Office states, less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year, however, for rent.
The negative development of the housing market, however, is not only in the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of the last few years.
Germany play a housing deficit, which is growing from year to year.
Currently, around 770.000 units were missing in the urban areas, Matthias Günther, author of the study laments.
For this reason, many professionals lived in large cities are forced to WG-rooms.
Young adults were due to the slowdown in the housing market involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama."
In the cities, the number of square meters per capita has declined in recent years, for the first time.
To solve the problem, the alliance "social housing" proposes a fresh start.
However, new incentives to boost social housing.
It could be dispensed with the estate tax and property taxes for subsidised housing will be temporarily suspended.
In addition, an attractive tax relief are necessary, according to the alliance.
The funding programme for refugee housing, the state bank KfW is already in towns and cities.
A week after the launch, more than half of the available around 300 million euros was on Monday evening, with 184 million euros has already been retrieved.
Now, the project could be increased.
Threatening refugees: Croatia and Slovenia have a direct corridor
After Hungary is practically no longer get through, as more and more refugees are choosing the path of Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant the transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken with the Slovenian interior minister, and if it is necessary, we will organise a corridor," said the Croatian Interior Minister Ranko project.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone.
The EU country, Croatia is not a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border have left hundreds of refugees to Croatia, to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, the Croatian television station RTL reported.
Hungary had sealed off the day before its border to refugees.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, there are proper asylum procedures in Hungary.
Croatia wants to take the refugees.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel, and we are preparing for that possibility."
These people are here, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who do not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had on the morning of the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbour Croatia.
According to media reports, most came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came with both the bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival they had tried to reach the green border with Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees are not on border fences.
The border strip carries other risks: There are still active mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Minesweepers are to create a safe passage now.
Little more refugees come to Hungary, however, after the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people picked up.
Shortly before the close of play on Monday, it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws are overcoming and damage to the border fence as a criminal offence.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged 35 criminal proceedings were started.
Sentenced to prison sentences of up to five years and the threat of expulsion from the country.
According to the immigration authority, we have received on Tuesday in the newly established at the border "transit zones" a total of 94 applications, almost all of them - 93 - the most important transitional Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees had stopped.
In practice, however, no one has a chance to get grants asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke workers started to clean up.
They collected the garbage, which had left tens of thousands of people in recent weeks by the roadside.
Sperrgitter were reduced, and one of the camps in the border town.
The goal of this renovation, no one wanted to express itself.
Austria reach after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants, according to government data, but still in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Rail travel from there to Germany was halted in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities.
In Freilassing regularly smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot.
The mayor drove "Gestrandete" across the border
"We have worked hard on the bridge on Sunday with clearing up, when ten people were suddenly with suitcases at the entrance to the tent," says Wernsteins mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Because Germany had stopped on Sunday, but because of the refugee flow rail traffic with Austria, it was for Fans in Wernstein closure, "said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the stranded, along with two other volunteers and their cars across the border into the near Passau.
Previously, we have catered for the windfall guests, with snacks and drinks.
As we have said, we bring them by car to Passau.
"It was evident to us," says Stadler in for the conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man did not take it to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"That has" been very happy, Stadler.
The stranded rail passengers were switched on Sunday evening in Wels by an ice into a regional train direction Passau, which took place shortly after the announcement that the train was stopped in Germany, still trying to cross the border.
But the regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In the Wernstein Grenzüberschreitende is generally held in high regard.
The bridges are combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, sociable, sporty, a day before two bridges - organized by the Union of Neukirchen Wernstein and Bavaria.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends many thousands more to us, is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the camp Röszke immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity, our Chancellor has officially and publicly brought up the attitude of the Hungarian government into the orbit of Nazism.
Victim of this policy, not only those Austrians who are now faced with a chaotic situation in the border areas.
The disciplined will have to say that the "promised land" that she has invited and welcomed, is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the continuing influx of refugees and the onset of winter, with decent conditions for asylum seekers.
And it will be an even bigger - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter fixed quarters
Konrad has with the refugee of our hands full.
Christian Konrad, it is usual that his word has weight.
The government has the powerful Raiffeisen bankers used to draw up lists for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the reception centre training churches already got to grips with Konrad.
"" We have no more homeless in training churches, he reported his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday, without much fuss, said Konrad and praised the organizational "masterpiece."
On the other hand, the Interior Ministry said of a "crisis situation."
Overall, Konrad anticipates a demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 homes over the next few weeks, must still be found - 20,000 countries are to provide 15,000 of the federal.
There are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it is" not a bottomless pit, Konrad said.
With the country captains, he has already held talks.
They had promised him to create more refugees in the coming quarters.
"In Upper Austria, it goes well," Ferry said Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow, there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, this needs to be clarified how the church will help.
Great expectations, the asylum coordinator in the ORF action "helping like us."
On the platform, individuals can easily offer accommodation.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticised the standards of accommodation as "very high."
In the face of adversity, it could not be that service provider must comply with a certain amount of towel or the size of the skylights.
For a limited time would have to be "emergency" ARDS.
The fact that he, in contrast to the Home Office in the accommodation is more successful, Konrad establishes with his experience.
I am an elderly gentleman, which is not easy in the face of the untruth.
Persuasion is his main weapon.
Konrad and Maier does not cause the Republic costs, as she herself said.
They want to increase their number of employees to three or four.
Their own accommodation search was not yet successfully.
Konrad wanted to set up a container on Stephansplatz as an office.
But obviously, there are problems with the approval.
Linz for a better division
For the time being, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center plans to accommodate refugees from the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, because it could accommodate people currently without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
For the emergency but other locations are to be tested for their suitability.
Criticism of the city boss exercises on the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
There are other districts have to contribute here.
Seehofer: "Borders are not sealed off."
In a lengthy telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) Provincial Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) akkordiert on Monday further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off.
The journey of refugees in the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there is now doing precisely the appropriate controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being, there will be no more.
To be seeking protection, however, with regular trains to Germany.
The other EU member states Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue.
Now that Austria is introducing new controls on its borders, for Pühringer "is a logical consequence" of the actions of the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The major overhaul of "new shipyard" in the Linz industry line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building is listed IT company S & T moved, the rest (2700 square meters) of young, innovative companies in the technology sector will be rented.
"In the IT are the wise heads of our raw material - and we need to try and make it work for us," says S & T CEO Hannes Lower Hauser.
He could imagine in startup companies to invest in the new shipyard and later to acquire them.
From the very beginning, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which Hauser down some promises: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time."
1.7 million euros were invested by S & T in the location, 3.3 million euros from the Tech Center, which belongs to a third of the city of Linz, the Province of Upper Austria and the German (FFG (Fédération Française de).
The building is leased from the Linz AG for 60 years of S & T and Tech Center.
30 percent of the 2,700 square metres of space in the building are already rented, for a further 40 percent, there are questions.

Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop is in operation.
Several weeks earlier, was rebuilt.
"But I have thought about for a long time, even if I should open a store," says Default.
The key to the decision was the fact that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, from the idea of a separate site where only their handbags are sold, were impressed.
"We are the only ones in the region Linz who sell this brand, the mother of two daughters, who has Italian roots.
Her interest in fashion has Default by her mother placed in the cradle.
If something is to me, and I can show new trends at affordable prices is the most.
Why do so many women fall at the sight of a beautiful handbag in rapture, even the experts can't answer with a final security.
Perhaps it is because a beautiful bag upgrades every outfit.
The starting with Brulljesmacher
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a village whose inhabitants are called a show-off.
This feature combines some of the billionaire, wants to be the US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for Aufreger.
Whether it is xenophobic, journalists rudely concerns or gaps in the international crisis policy revealed - the candidate for the US presidency to whip up the campaign vigorously.
And is doing well.
It is also registered starting in London, where the grandparents of the Immobilienmilliardärs Conservator.
The New Yorker with the hairdryer haircut has many in the village at the Wine Road.
Some of the 1200 inhabitants and is about dozens of corners is related to him.
His grandfather came from starting in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel shot a film about Trump.
And what the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
"I think that somehow it is exciting, but are also impressed in their Kallstadter kind not so deeply," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädterin has an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprouts, which in addition to Trump, the Heinz ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, "Kings of starting" (2014), so to speak - by saying that he would certainly be successful if he would live in starting.
The king of hearts, he has put it there.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tend to be of the opinion that Trump was "already a bit a big mouth," says Wendel.
Coincidentally, laute the nickname, the Kallstadt was in the vicinity, "The Brulljesmacher" - too high German: Angeber, she says.
So, Trump comes from the village of Angeber.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the grandfather immigrated to the United States and opened a restaurant for gold diggers.
Cornerstone of the real estate group's first land purchases in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents was not without tragedy: Her desire to return to the country in the long term, the Bavarian state, which belonged to the Palatinate.
It took Trump because he had once hewn without permission, the director of the Institute for pfälzische history and folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the movie's release.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal Auswanderers."
This is in contrast to the sometimes bombastic statements of the descendants.
He had repeatedly spoken contemptuously about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Like the poltert, this is not so good," says Hans Bender, a distant cousin Trump ("The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired vintner sees the Americans more aloof, "he is always so is exciting."
Does he believe that Trump is coming?
"I can not imagine," says the 72 year-old.
"He has never been about Kallstadt."
Guesthouse owner Veronika Schramm, like some Kallstadter mentions that a descendant of the family donated Heinz during a visit to the church organ, which was generally good.
"I can not imagine me from the Donald," says the 68-year old.
You think it would be better for him if the election because "have such radical views, I do not know if this is a good thing."
When those who were at the time of his grandfather in the United States, calling the shots, it would have been like him, "he would never even got there."
"There are" more interesting topics than him, vintner's daughter Sarah Bühler says.
And as the president?
"My president is" it is not, she says.
And: "The grapes are ripe, even without the President Trump."
Wendels film, Trump was interviewed for a long time, have seen 12 000 moviegoers, even in the US, the interest awakened.

The plans for the cottage settlement on the Little Mermaid in Emden to take shape.
The investor presented publicly for the first time plans for the project.
Many local residents are still worried - they fear the selling off of their leisure Sanctuary
For months, was negotiated behind closed doors, gegrübelt, debated and painted.
There are now plans for a new cottage settlement on the Little Mermaid near Emden on the table.
The visitor, the midsize Emder company "system construction," presented on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Council Emder his plans publicly for the first time.
This item originally had on the closed part of the agenda.
Under pressure from critics of the project and the FDP Group, which investors and accusing the administration secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the system construction management on the offensive: "We do not have an answer to all the questions," he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it would be good to be able to deal with all the rumours now.
The approximately ten to twelve million euros expensive project is under discussion for months.
Strong reactions among marine shops owners who had come to the meeting, provoked the images and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, sea stalls owner and board member of the advocacy of the riparian, Pro Hieve, complains: "This is a giant monster that dominates all other Gebaude."
In addition, he fears, like many other critics of the project that traffic will increase as a result of the planned size of the plant would be strong: "Since all Busladungen need to come, so it makes sense," says Schulz
What happens to the good one hectare site of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
Still, there is no operator.
"First, we need to have a consistent approach," said Ralf Behrends.
Because it was missing, including the development plans are variable.

Google launches Verdoppelungs fundraising campaign, about $11 million for refugees to gather
Google Inc (Googl; O) announced a Verdoppelungs-fundraising campaign that $11 million for humanitarian organisations have to help the thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations, from war torn and impoverished countries are fleeing.
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donations and call on his blog.
Instead of a manager to make the announcement, wrote Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul, when she was seven years old, about their personal experiences.
"Our trip included too many dark rail and bus routes, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I had luck.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family, desperate for help.
The donations will go to four charities, aid to refugees and migrants to: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million to google.com / Refugee Relief doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four years of civil war in Syria, which has sold more than 4 million people this year.
Many people are fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics can be helpful for weight loss surgery.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for obese people with type 2 diabetes, according to a new study may take at least five years.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time for something to show," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery wrote.
Weight-loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficient, but most of the studies were carried out by people who pathologically obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered as normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers used from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital data since 2007, they have gained in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery, gastric bypass and gastric tube education - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who embarked on this operation, fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained in those non-surgical diabetes treatments were roughly the same at 29.
Among those who undergo surgery, at 36% of the diabetes-disease completely and partially at 28%.
In the medical treatment group was full of diabetes compared to only one percent and partly in only about two percent.
In addition, the results were in the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept under 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c levels fell by about 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at around 8 percent.
But this "better" tooth control - as you are in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - do not reflect reduced mortality in five years, according to the Chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year had the bypass surgery group compared to the Gastrektomie Group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater declines in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded a complete removal of the diabetes (46,9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
It was in the Swedish study of obese people who undergo a Adipositas operation, about 29 percent less likely over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried konventionellere methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the surgery patients showed, Blackstone said, it should be reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation in the lower BMI group is lower," without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously, as soon as the patient lies with a BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that a reversal "as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes, it is really difficult.

"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not accommodate all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compas Ion in Oxford, which is devoted to the study of ethics.
He demanded that the interests of humanity should be put under the circumstances before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised in Germany and Austria's efforts to tackle the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Managing several thousand refugees, is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long term solutions, like a real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries can be created," he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and George Bush's actions commented after the terrorist attack on September 11, and it became clear that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in nonviolence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and this has led to unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four times the increase in use of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States report a nearly 400% increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow strong alcoholic hand disinfectants, the Georgia Poison Center.

"Children are becoming more common to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them go ends up in the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant deliberately, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a courage in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people disinfectants drink only because of a cheap experience.
Young people are supposedly disinfectant mixed with alcohol containing mouth water to obtain a stricter drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive aromas of disinfectant.
"A child does not think that this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are the ones who are perfumed.
It disinfectants with Erdbeer- safety and orange scent, which are very appealing to children.
Hands disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially young children just a few secret can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's" highly concentrated alcohol, Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency centre at the hospital of the University of Kansas, the broadcaster told Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you would have a sip of whisky stand around, but people leave this hand disinfectants within reach of children, and if children come out, then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six year old girl who had recently taken four secret of strawberry scented hand disinfectants in the school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, two times higher than the threshold for an adult and legally drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor, who in the Gwinnett Medical Center treated outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah lallte her words and was not able to go, when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, because the girl had fallen by alcohol and had gotten his head, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary, Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, CNN said.
It would be fatal for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use soft products or disinfecting wipes and hand disinfectants should be stored beyond the reach of the child.
About alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario women died after swallowing of hands of disinfectants, which contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York, planned to poison their "nasty" teacher by misconstrued antibacterial products around the classroom, "it reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished them from their room.
The police saw the foiled plan as "chatter" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.

Why do I will be witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man will be put to death.
When it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will be in a public gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State from 1929, when Richard Glossip will be executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was back in January for the first time about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and since there are often more applicants than places available, a macabre lottery will take place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected, who will observe it dispassionately.
I can do that.
I will sit alongside Richard Glos IPS closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we are talking about.
The prison authorities say that I am not a witness and a journalist, so it will not be possible for me, a notebook and a pen to take to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to abandon my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she had "put it better," but she still thinks that it is wrong to what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I have said and written.
He tells me what I have to write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses.
But he wants an international reporter is here to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that the publicity of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bell, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you should hear a series of podcasts, which I have made.
I do not want to go back on all the details.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed.
But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can go for it.
What you will get from me, is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after police chase wasn't persuaded, from the Canning River to come
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth, the police depend, has failed to return when he was in the shallow and marshy water, just a few metres away from a police officer who tried to persuade him gently, to the shore. "
The police from Canning Vale was on Tuesday at a break incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them in the direction of the Canning River.
But he was not too far.
"He was in the water and said 'I don't come out, come and get me, Senior Sergeant Shan dell Castle Dine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too thrilled to make his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiated."
"Sometimes people do funny things in order to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castle Dine.

Peter Moody says that stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end the racing
Peter Moody claims that by Racing Victoria stewards have tried last year to install a spy in his stables and threatened to end the race immediately.
He appealed to the stewards and the Integritäts department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai due to a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the race, and he himself had found under difficult conditions, when it comes to the positive cobalt swab test at Lidaris was that he could not explain.
He had 18 months because of the espionage accusations withheld and did not want it "look like grapes hanging too high."
"I was going to say nothing, and I have sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once, Moody said.
You know that it went.
Sometimes you respond, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head held high, and I want my owners think I try my best for them.
When they start to think that I am not doing that, then I should no longer be coach.
Then I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had the bomb in an interview with racing.com walk that the Integritäts department had tried to spy on his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call when I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables, in order to provide information about what I am doing in my stables," Moody said of Racing.
They seem to believe that I am a fraudster.
If that is the case, they should certainly look to their noses because they have failed in an attempt to keep it.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time, and it still is.
That should bring me to the view that it will be personally?
The RVL has behaved cowardly and perhaps people outside of coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Perhaps the people out there think that I am.
Maybe they need to give me my license and offend me, and I have no doubt that what I say, think about it.
But I am now at the point where it is no matter to me, and that makes me sad.
It makes me really sad.
I am going to put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustrations levels of the trainer, with the protracted cobalt on Lidari's investigation, and the late scratching meant that he said that he "his license could throw on the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation for the unbeaten Black Caviar Master, described the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay on the horses legs had been applied, which breached against the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this, "he said.
"One of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on the leg.
It would have been so last night.
It would have been all day yesterday, which was true.
But it also had it on race day.
Moody with a three month disqualification to be confronted with the treatment of the pack on race day. An investigation into this matter was opened.
It is a joke.
People who set up these rules, know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that we need rules, but here they have gone too far," said Moody.

Melbourne-Storm coach Craig Bellamy proposes against rivals due to allegations of ring fight back
The Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has been criticism of the tack of his players as "agenda setting" of two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said that the referees "ring the Storm players fighting" with his team during the high storm's victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening have allowed.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm team after his team won the finals against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night had achieved. He called the game a "prime example" of the Rugby League, and said that the two from Queensland "not too well" in the struggle.
The Tacklimg Bellamy defended his team and said that they were only focused on the tack, on their "Contact."
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team confidently agree with him, because it means that they are concerned, the Storm team to be beaten.
"It comes up again and again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson spoke about wrestling matches than they have beaten us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed throughout the year in our defensive system or techniques, but we have made over the last six weeks, our contact in football makes a real focus, and that has brought us to the turnaround.
Trent has been there for three years, and he is obviously losing a great team to train, and he is therefore probably not since, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how this appears again at this time of year.
Bellamy Bennetts idea attacked by the "exciting football" and his mentor recalls that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting their game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember that St George was criticized in 2010 as a boring team, and Wayne said that he would take a shit dirt.
But now he has a team that can play and what we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game that you want to play when you have these kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play the kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they have probably not thought to us when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game against Storm ROOSTERS achieved a higher score than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I have not yet seen it, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game 20: 18, there are two further attempts in our game, but it is an exciting game?
Or breaks are no points and make something interesting?
For me, it is the game plans.
When they talk to us, it means that we will be taking in a stage for them.
The Storm team has released this weekend, as they have won the right to either North Queensland Cowboys or the quiet surrounding the Sharks next Saturday night at AAMI Park to receive Vorfinale. The ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning.
Serbians with $200,000 bail after drug charges
A man may face a life sentence for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that were smuggled to Queensland, was released on a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month, after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay from South America through Vanuatu and applied in August in Coomera.

JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square metre cell are degrading
The Federal Constitutional Court, a former prisoner of the University of Tegel right, who spent months in a small cell was housed.
Due to the violation of their human dignity, in principle, prisoners are entitled to financial compensation, if they are housed in too small cells.
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the stakeholders can even hope for money when they were locked up for a few days in the tight spaces (Az.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).
It was a former prisoner with its constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe successful: He was at the University of Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a solitary cell with about five square metres of floor space accommodated; the toilet was not spatially separated.
Afterwards, the man who, according to his lawyer, has now been released, had been moved to a larger cell.
His liability lawsuit due to the degrading conditions against the country failed in Berlin.
But the constitutional judges waived the judgment of the Court of Berlin and referred the case back for further examination.
You can see the dignity of the man.
Court of Appeal will decide on the amount of compensation
Even if only for a few days in prison days were the compensation for legal reasons, largely from the period in question was given a compensation claim, it said.
Otherwise, a support its decline of the legal protection of personality would be "to fear."
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of cash compensation.
The constitutional judges have strengthened many times in the past, the rights of prisoners.
She spoke only in April, a prisoner compensation because he was locked up naked in a cell.
Degrading the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet, according to a decision by 2011.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday, the Constitutional Court of Berlin, who had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009, a decent accommodation.
The plaintiff was placed over three months between 15 to 21 hours a day in a similar cell, such as in the case of Karlsruhe.
The Berlin prisons had come in recent weeks due to a lack of staff in the headlines.
Prisoners are locked up for 23 hours, again and again, the aggressiveness is rising, even with beatings, it should have been because of the tense situation.
According to the press office of justice 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied due to lack of talent, 19 2016 will be lost.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We create it."
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What is in Germany?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come after predictions of the Federal Ministry of the Interior to Germany this year, according to the Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD, Germany is even able to include a million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we do it."
What is in store for Germany, gives the following overview.
According to various estimates are needed between 350000 (estimate by the German Federal Ministry) and 400,000 (estimate of Pestel Institute) homes a year - and the next five years.
That is almost twice as much as previously (250000 homes will be built.
Dramatically, however, is the lack of housing, especially affordable rental properties: A year falling out 60,000 to 80000 social housing from the rental price fixing, and these attractive apartments will also apply for refugees.
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) intends to double the funding, currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing would have to occur every year, and the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists agree and federal construction minister is that it also needs to give more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Employment Research, 55 percent of the workforce in the long term can be disciplined in Germany.
However, the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications, to help them start, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees is crucial, however, whether they can find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also the self esteem of immigrants, migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt says.
In Germany, there has been a political shift, according to Thränhardt: From the work ban for refugees on the recognition of work.
While there was a ban on asylum seekers in the past five years, it has been reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the duty of residence, limits the asylum seekers to a place of residence.
The company has the vision - also because of the resources - mostly enforced that refugees should be allowed faster access to the labour market.
A major hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is a sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.
In addition, studies show that most jobs are conveyed through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore Thränhardt according to the royal road to integration work.
The Berlin school administration found that only a few station parents give their children to the care centres, it is estimated that 10 to 15 percent, "for the displaced parents is very important to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Department.
However, in order to convince the family from the benefits of Kita, the administration hand slip distributed in different languages.
The need for educators were to rise due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing more schools.
In countries without the knowledge of German students in Welcome classes are prepared for the classroom.
But they are not always informed by fully trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, including teachers who only have a qualification in English as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration says.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no state asylum seekers or indulgent prohibits the study - the only exception in Berlin, Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has been abandoned, but now his attitude.
Studierwilligen refugees could be facilitated access to university.
For refugees with a residence permits or tolerance do not receive benefits under the current law, asylum seekers more if they begin a study.
The latter are basically not Bafög because they do not fall into the circle of people entitled to BAföG.
So far Belgium refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years, in order to be eligible Bafög-, from 1 January 2016 to cut the margin to 15 months.
But even this funding gap needs to be closed, Steffen crash, Berlin's state secretary for science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
The students should immediately get Bafög.
Islam will play an important role in the future, because many of the refugees are Muslim, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
Islam, the state should grant the same rights as they have the churches, and the existing state-church law to a new state-religion ratio.
Also important is the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association, who cares professionally for the new arrivals.
On the rights and obligations.
As the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas, and to give him some control.
This includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Ayman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany, "immediately to their right, here," in Germany, forfeited, he said in the Bavarian broadcasting.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic.
Integration in the future will be much more than it is now a topic of the whole society.
The majority of society will have to change, the elimination of discrimination and racism is pressing.
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - less than a decade since an anti-discrimination and a general equality law.
But it learns very slowly, as the series showed the spirits of murder, the police and the authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrants organizations and stakeholders not white German demand for a long time and commit what international agreements, such as the anti-racism convention, Germany, has to be a reality in the next few years, if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany would be able to provide the expected refugees medically, doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery says.
"As far as a power and capacity, we create it," he told the Daily Mirror.
However, this extra money to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery wants to hand over all arrivals on the registration health cards.
Services could be charged later with the Länder.
And, in the long term, it is highly questionable to toss as many people with limited service catalog, which stipulated the current law on asylum seekers.
Otherwise, the doctors are especially the language barriers.
In the past, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are informed about their illness worse than other patients.
Not only in hospitals, including medical practices would have to be taken on interpreting costs, she says.
Many refugees would be helped but also with more general medical correspondents in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, for example, there are far more unprocessed disability, and young people go to HIV education.
With some of the other diseases, German doctors would come from their education, but clearly, Montgomery says.
"Parasite infections or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And as far as the shortage of doctors, even relief may be in sight for the refugees.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, but they would have to prove their qualifications and may drop again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany, according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapy (BPtK) mentally ill: Most suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, says Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Anyone who is suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder, among other things, suffers from "flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, palpitation and Todesängsten.
Other symptoms of sleep and concentration disorders, strong shock and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the chronic symptoms would be an early treatment, Munz said.
So far, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services can make a request for a psychotherapy, but the process usually takes several months.
In addition, clerks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses were mostly in the social services, to decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misjudgments, Munz says.
Manege invites to dream
With the new staging of "passion" of the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus arts.
The aim is to draw every age group under the spell of fascinating acrobatics, animal dress and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites to the manege on the brick ­ Wasen dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I cannot imagine to live without my circus family," Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior leader says.
"Passion" - under this motto, the current Manegeninszenierung.
For more than 33 years, the circus is in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift is to inspire the family is in the blood.
"It is important to us, the people from their daily routine wegzuholen and for two hours in a completely different world to take," says the 27-year old junior leader.
"Manegencocktail with cosmopolitan flair," says director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometres long tour this flair can now experience.
The programme of the circus with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family, the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo brothers understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, it wants to include the Cuban duo.
Lightness and agility - they identify with these words.
Their humorous art on the mast is to conquer the hearts of women.
Fascinated by many roars of laughter from the acrobatics of the Circus Probst with sensitivity and flexibility.
With the unicycle balance on a ball?
No problem for 10K Pursuit yuan.
Snakes fascinated by people and frightening at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is the oldest form of acrobatics, like some familiar and fascinated with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals are part of our family," Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Abuses in the attitude of circus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes the view: "It is not good for our animals, it is also not good for us."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy any pranks canvas.
"The four legged artists," as they are affectionately called, can be read as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
The animal is not feeling well, it is not in the manege.
Therefore, the top priority: Good care for the animals.
Specifically on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a pen and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our small Jumbo, was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for it, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So something for every visitor should be there.
"One thing is for sure," Stephanie Probst says: "Whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always do our best and do it with all my heart."
The Circus Probst invites from 17 to 20 September at 5 and 8 p.m. every day to his ideas.
On Sunday, the program will begin at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday's family, for the presentation at 5 p.m., prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10: 00 to 18: 00.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down at the beginning of the year, from a podium on the staircase.
He was unhurt, but the video of the event quickly spread on social media.
The opening of Parliament was marred by allegations of members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats, and they were warned to accompany the speech by Mr Mugabe with Buhrufen.
Last month, they had booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Union address in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change (Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians text messages on their mobile phones have received that warning, Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number that is not shown, but it has the title" death, "he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
She warns the affected House members that the immunity ends in Parliament, and as soon as they leave the House, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan intimated Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers of the politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and Einsparungs's efforts to reduce the company's services.
HP will later this year, split into two publicly traded companies, and the computer and printer business from its fast growing enterprise hardware and services and business activities.
The expected job cuts will lead to a load of more than $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.

The Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack to have a look
Wenger stressed to look that it is only September and if his rehabilitation is proceeding according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario is that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England, and given his history, his participation in next summer's European Championship certainly still uncertain.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then back to his old swing had found during the low season.
This kind of "at risk of injury is not the career," Wenger said.
It is a bone that has not healed well.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his ankles, or with the injuries he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but also, as Wenger acknowledged, there is the risk of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier injuries Ltd has 23 different diseases of look since his debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of arsenal 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08, one of the two Premier League clubs who have suffered the most damage.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and combat force," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilises, I am confident that he will do it and go through a career of the kind that he deserves.
Arsenal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb in the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and" the players who need to take a little breather, Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress from Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the biggest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is unrivalled after 41 games, after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, with 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale.
This year, it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal, the lesson of the last season with the Champions League defeat against Monaco has taken and will continue to be driven by the distant hope, with his management of the club to its first UEFA Champions League triumph.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I am in the business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
Friends: The comedy show that we are serious lessons about male friendship grants
The lack of similar images in the show is obvious, particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up, now more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In a bid to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign announced against a pathetic life) 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of challenging the culture in question, rivalling the men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the suffering a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood" had his chances of recovery are doubled.
For those who are not depressed, half a circle of mentally healthy friends, the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends first, so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media's communications, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives are lively, strong, and to be successful, doubled, even though, in reality, dominates the isolation.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsischer values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health is much deeper.
And like a video game inventor and billionaire recently declared that money can buy happiness, not really.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus has been turned upside down.
Each character was not defined by his work, but because of his personality, which was conspicuous by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and his frequent hugs, moments when football peering in comfortable armchairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to, in any case, even if they are often withhold to fully explore their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me:... "my audience role for people who are feeling depressed and at risk of suicide, has really made me see how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us, often do not feel able to talk with friends.
The old saying "I come in," has a huge impact on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly. "
Friends one of the shows that comes to my mind is when I try to offer langfristigere coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
So my objective outsider status on the phone to people in moments of despair may also help, the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so when you visit this weekend with the Comedy Central) festival to celebrate the day, completely redesigned scenery, why don't you take your friends for a drink at the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you sit in Starbucks to see someone alone, you give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference could make your friendship.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for # friends fixed
Di Maria hits to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.

Here is the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept course, as Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who the French champions on the road, but then they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cavani in the 61st minute, a Kopfballtor.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions, because it is not only the qualification for the K.O.-Runden, but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a great game by Laurent Blancs team with real Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate, and he was later in the game against his hometown team, and against the club with whom he made his illustrious career began back in 1999, changed.
"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it's a good start to look back, 2: 0 to win, and to cause problems to our opponents, even if there are certain things that we still" in the course of the season to perfection, Blanc said.
"It is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we have won, although I regret that we have not yet made one or two more goals. "
Beckham, who returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which at the weekend with a 2: 2 draw on home ground against Bordeaux in the league could hold, but he was in the fourth minute trumped by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing striker has been described as the man who PSG to the next level in Europe can take when he last month has been taken over by Manchester United, and he suggested that when he turned in Marco Erzähler pass behind the defence ran into Malmö University, before he passed to Johan Wiland nicely into the corner of the net.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory that was disappointed.
Malmö, Celtic beat in a play-off to reach this stage, came to national Anpiff with nine players on the field and was with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield strung a serious opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed away in Kevin Trapps post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG gave themselves sometimes, with some false passports and poor qualifications, not least from Inter, who was went on no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the reboot.
Nevertheless, he proved a lot more skill when he brought his players into the game and it was a pass from Inter, Di Maria turned into a spin shot by Wiland in the 52nd minute was diverted past the post.
The second goal finally came just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The pampero scored his sixth Saisontor after Ibrahimovic a left flank of Maxwell had been exploited.
That ended any thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only a superb intervention by Wiland from a short distance to stop David Luiz, the end result could be low, before substitute player was Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later announced that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough. "
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!

Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation in Rome, there is now a place of Martin Luther.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino on Wednesday was a previously anonymous place in the park on the Oppio-hills in the name of the German reformer.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero," he is now recognised as a "German theologian of the Reformation."
The park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome, right next to the Coliseum.
The name had been requested by the Association of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Lutheran church hymns in Rome, recalled Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of popes for centuries as a minority, often only able to live their faith in secret.
The space will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome would be welcome.

Hammer artists invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with a crown of thorns (gilded) is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus old Post wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which is now published with magnificent images.
In the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt, who has made over 150 motifs of his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with bright colours and imaginative forms has received the 75 year olds - but what is not synonymous with "funny" images.
On the contrary, in line with the relevant issues that may seem pretty bleak.
Around three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he is a subjective and artistic choice from the many areas of "Book of Books".
Born cycles that address issues such as Way, plagues, bids or are our father.
Thus, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publishing with its theological orientation, as well as for the Kettler Verlag, with its focus on art books.
And as the author Klaus old post, who has worked on the basis of the painting with the respective Bible is especially challenging.
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt, and so to the present day, "translated into current relationships.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and one set of the artist, who is his own personal thoughts on the current situation.
The jewellery cover has golden letters.
This allows the 75-year old twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that the strict Protestant doctrine of Order.
"The education was" already with the cane, Otmar Alt recalls.
"I have tried to come to terms with it, in order to cope with me, perhaps with the Lord father."
His second concern is to bring the art of fast moving time to more important: "The perception of visual worlds from advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is out there.
Artists have a different pleasure and bliss to show things.
Pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur.
Otmar Alt wants the viewer into the images "fall" will be able to allow them to see and feel what power they have, "the image to his counterpart."
Klaus old Post confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-old Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "" has always been a lover of Otmar Alts was art: "I like how he sees with his life."
Alt did not care to fully comprehend the Bible, but selected the key for him, even mysterious topics.
"This was not a cooperation on an equal footing," says old post: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains." As a Bible.
For Hans Möhler from Luther's publishing this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."
Otmar Möhler Alts images speak for both the (biblical) language of love and responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt Foundation will be opened.

Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Willow TO in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, any hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game to break the Europa League final.
The national team is the league leader of the Football League in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7 p.m. / Sky).
"Unfortunately, we can not rely on him," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
If Reus on Sunday in the Bundesliga's top match against Liverpool will be there again, the BVB coach openly: "We expect a return from him at training on Friday."
Given the high cost of its professionals will not only his Stammelf Tuchel on the Reus position.
So he announced a change to the goalkeeper position.
That is why novel willows TO takes the place of tribal keeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains on an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
If, in the future, the Holzfeller pastures in all Europe League games the Tuchel, however, left open.
With a high probability he will also deny the second game.

Robot cars: Government wants to lead for Germany
Germany is supposed to be according to the will of the federal government to change the car technological pioneers.
The federal cabinet on Wednesday approved a strategy paper from the house by Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes, among other things, investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the fringes of the IAA auto show of a "new era of mobility."
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and provide less congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries to discuss at the IAA also meet with representatives of the industry.
The strategy of the Transport Ministry, among other things, emphasises the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid Umstiegs on digital radio.
For the testing of new technology, a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently under construction.
Thus, any additional liability risks are saddled with the driver, "" the federal government wants to review the legal framework "and, where necessary, to adapt to the new developments."
So, for example, Germany wants to engage internationally to ensure that the speed limit is raised for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km / h.
In addition, the federal government wants to push for a change to the Vienna Convention, which stipulates only the people as a driver.
The automated driving the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver will be more and more to the passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data within seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads "were not expected until well after 2020."
The added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving features in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the cars can be safer and more efficient to run on the road," said the SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
The question of liability in the event of accidents and the security of personal data, however, the driver needs to be clarified.
The German self driving cars, however, are sceptical - much more than the French or the Americans.
A Wednesday at the AA's poll by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars in the next ten years will prevail, only 32 percent expect it in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect with autonomous driving cars by 2025, 33 percent in the United States.
Anyway, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self.
According to a survey of the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give up control over the entire trip on all roads.
On the highway that could be present in the flowing traffic as much as 15 percent to 45 percent in a traffic jam.
Well, one in four would car control under any circumstances.

Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of major fashion show and a wax figurines-shop of horrors: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63), on Wednesday in Munich, an exhibition of his work.
The highlights: Mannequins that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
You have the spectacular creations of the French designer, who was, among other things, with Madonna's stage outfits for the big star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skirts.
"I can no longer say that I am the enfant terrible of the Haute Couture, because I have white hair."
"Before, it was bleached, now it is" genuine, Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The 100 To The catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), on 18 September at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung is seeing, it is fortunate that the fashion designer of his initial opposition to a show about his person has changed.
In fact, he had been against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When one dies, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris.
"It is about so much more than just beautiful clothes," the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diedrich said more.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the end is hard to work for the man who has written fashion history without ever completed an apprenticeship.
The show is not arranged chronologically, but it is an excellent choreographiertes total work of art, which was used for a lot of effort: In order to fudge the dolls, for example, has built a Stylist.
14 tons of material, the maker, according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot gekarrt to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest was a special treat: A leather trousers-outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Also old Teddy's tires can be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, tentative steps of designer fashion.
As a child, he was not a good student (and) bad in football, he was attracted to his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll, his parents had not allowed him.
The design of the fashion he had taught himself later.
He stole fashion magazines and the designs of other designers looked at how Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, I bought the then of course.
For his first fashion show, he was unable to pay for the models.
They got nothing but the clothes were allowed to keep.
Jewellery instead of curtain - Plauener tip as a fashion niche
Before it went to the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace in a large amount of customers who, for example, they processed to blankets and curtains.
That no longer works alone, Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of fashion tip Plauen explains.
Instead, the fashion is important.
In the early days of the Plauener top fashion played a major role, was then replaced by the domestic textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: Top in jewellery, accessories such as handbags and regional costumes.
Indeed, says the vintage fashion, which in past eras, a growing business potential.
Anyone who served in the textile industry in Germany is not a niche, is no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Fashion tip Plauen, along with nine other companies in the industry association Plauener lace and embroidery.
Only they can wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales are tonight.
Private shops and wholesale, there are almost no more.
Our products reach the customers in this way.
Today, the commodity will be manufactured in Asia, much cheaper and sold almost exclusively on chains.
In addition, the export schwächle, currently to Russia and the United States.
So, enough reason for new routes.
The industry association is trying to score points by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains the stick pearl in Falkenstein: "Since this year, we have a quality seal, which shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable."
Reinhardt added: "It also refers to the materials used."
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg Branch of the West Saxon Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and lace.
To counter the competition from Asia, you need to find high quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and businesses who need to think, especially economically, "Schmidt says.
Therefore, an existing design will often vary only slightly to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revitalized the historic snowball head.
However, the machine uses small beads in some places.
The Plauener Goldsmith champion Bianca Hall Bach did it inspire Krauße became: "Before I could start with traditional Plauener tip nothing."
Now she uses the snowball head for her jewellery.
In an elaborate procedure, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region to identify with the topic of Plauener tip - young and old," says Reuter.
It also returns to the US, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area, and who want a piece of memory.
I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener lace.

XI urges to open up the economy more broadly for the world
The economy needs to be more open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday, a group that has been entrusted with the management of the reform.
"China should commit itself to foreign investment and expertise to attract and improve strategies for business," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group on the deepening of comprehensive reform.
Fostering startups and further reforms will bring new momentum and vitality, and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.

According to the statement, a negative list is created to identify the sectors and companies that do not qualify for investment.
The system will be gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources to ensure a fair business environment and the market open, the statement said.

The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of international economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.

EU wants to limit mercury in predators double
The European Commission wants to double the levels of mercury in large predators and consumers expect a much higher dose of nerve gifts.
The consumer organisation Food Watch, which is a working paper by the EU, sharply criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policy with full force to pregnant women and infants passed," said Matthias Wolf Schmidt of the Watch.
Wolf Schmidt says that the limits of the nerve poison should be raised for big fish at the end of the food chain, such as Hai- or swordfish for "economic reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predators are already burdened with so much mercury that around 50 percent of the catches are based on the current limits cannot be sold.
Then, after doubling the limit only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return, the EU wants to tighten for this easing, according to food Watch the limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Food Watch described it as "trick" because smaller Fried fish such as carp are usually burdened so low that they already comply with the planned levels.
The reduction in small fish is "a perfides diversionary tactic that helps the economy," said Wolf Schmidt.
Mercury for humans, a highly toxic heavy metal that accumulates in the food chain, especially in predators is strong.
Therefore, the federal government warns that "even small amounts can cause great damage to the nervous system in the unborn."
The Federal Ministry for the Environment explains on its website regarding the current limits, however, that a "health risks to the general population" is not expected.
Mercury mainly by the coal combustion into the environment.
The German coal plants run according to a written report of the Federal Ministry for the Environment of the German Green MEP Anna Lena Baer Bock, more than six tons of mercury a year, two thirds of the total emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "permanent and comprehensive" mirror "exceeded in March from the paper," quoted.
In the past year were European warnings about mercury in fish is already among the most common reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
