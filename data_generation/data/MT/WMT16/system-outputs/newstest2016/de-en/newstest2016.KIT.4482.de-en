Obama welcomes Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement, as well as on Tehran destabilizing actions in the Middle East.
At the meeting but it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and discussed the two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is strained for years.
Washington criticized Israel's ongoing settlement construction and Netanyahu unwillingness in the peace process.
Through the deal promoted by Obama to the Iranian nuclear program, the relationship between the two continues to deteriorate.
In March, Netanyahu was at the invitation of the Republican Party held a controversial speech to the US Congress, which was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not coordinated with Obama, a meeting had rejected this, with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency, Professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency, Professor Shannon Lamb told a somewhat tremulous voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his house.
Lamb, it was important to stress that his "cute dog" but still live and was probably excited, and he said that the families of the dead woman contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss, a handwritten note that was scrawled on a white block: "I am sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, has already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he was shot and killed, according to the police, a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn said that his university employees the shooting heard at 10: 18 pm.
He said that Lamb made the fateful call at some point after that.
By the end of the day, there was another death: lamb committed suicide when police surrounded him.
A day after the shootings at the university, the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details released by investigators on both ends of the state, as well as what the students and staff who knew him testify, helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said that they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal record.
Schmidt's Lamb himself had mentioned in a book written by him, in which he spoke of the "beautiful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both teach in the department of social sciences and history, whose faculty comprises 17 members, and many students attended classes from both.
At the same time, there were some inclines to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, praised the Lamb, said he seemed a little too excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously at Delta State University asked for a leave for medical reasons and said that he had any health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the employment policies of the university meant that the promotion, for which Lamb had worked so hard for him, would not guarantee an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course, there was something in Mr. Lambs notion."
These are questions that can no longer reply to lamb.
After fleeing the campus police found the Lambs later track, when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested Lamb, killed himself selbstmit a d caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents ' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009, which has 3500 students in a city with about 12000 inhabitants, and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in spring in pedagogy.
One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when she met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who a few years tried to teach her to play the guitar.
He was the crowd of women.
All the girls melt away when he was there, " said Hairston, now 40 and living in the suburb of Jackson, Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obvious for some time.
The emergency call Lamb said: "I have killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which shares a border with a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was in order.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O ' Steen, said that they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter, who was 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," said O ' Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O ' Steen said he had never met, but Lamb by his daughter, Abigail, he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb hit Prentiss, when he and Abigail three years ago at a summer-year market.
They later played together one or two gigs.
O ' Steen, said his daughter, sings and writes her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a low-lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5, the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and Mundharmonikaspiel finished a meager audience.
There were no signs that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were in the clean up and joked with each other.
I think they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, a dead professor, headed the first-year seminar program, specializing in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including teachers, staff, students and members of the community in a candle lighting ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, during the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and sang "amazing Grace."
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We are trying to encourage our students to go back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call, after he had shot, Schmidt and that lamb in his emergency Prentiss is referred to as his wife, but there is no indication that the two were ever married.

Michael J. Fox joked about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "back to the Future" professionally was a big moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was remarkable also for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royalty, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it is gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary "back in Time."
The film begins, and it occurred to me that I am a simulated GÃ¤hnen and an arms length away from being in a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," a documentary on "back to the Future," presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemecki's and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had its premiere in 30 years.
"It is really for me," said Spielberg, "indisputably the greatest time travel movie that has ever been filmed."
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "there is no military solution" to the conflict lasted nearly five years, and more weapons of violence and misery for millions of people will only make matters worse.
The UN chief again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member-nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the fringes of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers "this intractable situation."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tackling the crisis in Syria, which they have demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But regardless of how some Republicans are trying to take Donald Trump from the upper echelons in the polls, it has not worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump leading in double digits, and some are beginning to ask themselves seriously, what does it mean for the chances of the nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one contends that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership on the rising Herman Cain was made, none of which has only won one state in the nominating process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and begin to make their dollars go to topple him.
Here are some of the latest poll numbers, which suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase.
Trump's popularity ratings have been rotated by 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans had a real-estate mogul.
There were 40 per cent by mid-July.
At the beginning of August, there were 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three in ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And keep these numbers in early states.
A Quinnipiac-vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with GOP candidates as Trump.
Last week, in a poll conducted by CNN/ORC, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump would be nominated.
Only two out of 10 saying they were "upset" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they were "thrilled" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in terms of excitement?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they were "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters leaning to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul had the right temperament for a president, ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same is true in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to the Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 per cent think that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament did not fit into the White House, ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
If they keep their hats to scholars Trump, Republican voters for real.
If they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a poll by CNN/ORC from last week, four out of ten, that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clear crystal globe in the past.
At this time last cycle, four out of ten Republicans, Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to only 28% of the final candidate Mitt Romney.
However, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters, Trump's campaign, viewed as a plausible.
Even if the Republicans are gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everybody.
Some experts suggest that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump's leadership, while the anti-Trump's support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates diffuse.
But a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping the majority support.
He has Carly Fiorina 13-point lead before Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points before Jeb Bush 19 points and, finally, from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would be the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump's fans say that they have formed their opinions.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump, say that they have lost their voices.
Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say, the view never changes.
46 per cent said that they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump's strongest competition at the moment the other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinions, are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump when it comes to immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago, immigrants from Mexico called "rapists" that immigration was the lynchpin in the public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic language critical of Trump Hispanic-Americans will stay away from the Republican Party and will damage the Neuorientierungs's efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems to be Donald Trump.
The frustration over the government climbed to new highs.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, now accounts for roughly half of the support of Republican voters, particularly by their outsider status.
Six of 10 Republicans say the new Monday-ABC/Post, they would rather have a political outsider, as someone with government experience.
And they are also angry at Washington.
A survey of the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg two weeks ago in Iowa shows that three out of four of Iowa's Republicans frustrated with the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unhappy" and 21 percent "hellish angry."
Munich, Germany, the island of Sylt and Co.: the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex, overlooking the North Sea.
In the street, a square metre costs a Reetdachhauses averaged 73300 euros.
"On the island of Sylt is inherently limited," the range of objects, it says in the study - so the high price.
A new study shows what particular locations in a square metre costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euro per square metre for a student room in Munich is not really enough.
In contrast to Germany's top residential places comes a price but still peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & VÃ¶lkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations, with land prices in dizzy heights.
There are tens of thousands of euros - nix per square metre, mind you.
But anyway, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is here for once, not even at the top.
Champions League: Bayern's dream start thanks to MÃ¼ller and idol
Two scorers in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Mueller has just one run.
A lucky strike by Thomas MÃ¼ller's FC Bayern paved the way to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran.
A sovereign prelude to the Champions League season.
The world champion Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze in the cauldron of Piraeus had a dream start in the "mission" of the FC Bayern.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Mueller double Pack (52/90 + 2) and GÃ¶tzes hits (earned), with 3: 0 (0: 0).
The twelfth home success in the series will be the first step towards final on May 28, 2016, in Italy, where Guardiola at the third attempt to finally bring the Henkel Potts to Munich.
Mueller got his 28th goal in the Champions League to Bayern's benevolent assistance of Olympiakos's goalkeeper Roberto, who had a shot intended as a flank of the World Cup.
"We will not underestimate them," Bavaria's captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium before 31688 capture fans - and the thought of Munich.
They showed a focussed and committed performance, without having to shine.
Piraeus had won its last six home games in the premier class, including against well-known clubs like Manchester United, AtlÃ©tico Madrid or Juventus.
2011 stumbled here also Borussia Dortmund (1-3).
But the Bavarians, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams undefeated, did not want to be the next victim.
They were brave, but ran in their offensive efforts often unimaginative to work.
The attacks were often initiated by game shift to external links, Douglas Costa, who opposed the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui rarely occurred.
MÃ¼ller had more luck on the right when his flank from the right mid-field in the top left Toreck.
In the 66th minute, the world champion of the possible 2-0.
The best times in one half had Robert Lewandowski.
First of all, when Olympiakos-striker Ideye Brown, the head of the ball, beat Poland from the line (26).
Then, by direct inspection, the goalkeeper parried Roberto with the knee (35th).
Although the Bayern used to affix their dominant game, Piraeus needle stitches.
At goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was our bond.
For example, when he took a shot of Ideye on the Latte (56th).
Before Guardiola re-erected a chain of four with David Alaba in the centre of defence alongside Jerome Boateng, who made it good.
Mario Goetze, according to muskulÃ¤ren problems back in the squad, was sitting outside.
The World Cup hero was only after the completion of training given the green light, said member Matthias Sammer in "sky": "anyone who wants to make something different out of it, that is evil."
At the first change of Guardiola also decided against him, when he brought Kingsley Coman for beleaguered Lewandowski (59th).
Goetze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and 13 minutes later, everything was clear, via penalty, MÃ¼ller.
Before the game, it was in the stadium riot.
After a smaller group of partially masked and Bayern fans in their viewers-block apparently provoked the followers of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and went in with batons against the Munich-based supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium.
Smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth
Anyone who smokes, thus not only harms the lungs, but also the teeth - that suggests a long-term study of Potsdam.
The good news: the risk of abandonment is declining quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the long-term study of an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute of Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam, Germany.
Compared to non-smokers, in smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely to the 2.5 to 3.6-fold higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23300 subscribers.
The main causes of tooth loss are cavities and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE.
For these periodontitis is smoking a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The link between smoking and tooth loss, therefore, go to frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
Is not clear the extent to which smoking also increases the risk for tooth decay.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk, but within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years, until the danger to fall back to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham England.
We need to convince people, to be non-smokers, said study director Heiner Boeing from the DIfE: "smoking shortens life."
Smoking is not good for lungs and blood vessels and leads to an old age, according to our findings, even on a good dental health.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population are affected by loss of teeth at the age of 65 to 74 years, divided the DIfE.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increase the risk for early tooth loss.
The new long-term study confirm the findings.
Archaeologists find remains from the Late Antiquity to Cologne on the banks of the Rhine
For the umpteenth time, archaeological discoveries have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne, Germany.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germanic Museum excavated skeletons and remnants of historic buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the start of construction on the river Rhine, historians are on the lookout for so-called monuments.
In all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always a Fachamt for Archaeological soil restoration.
The archaeologists have now been found in the third phase of the Rhine River Boulevard.

In addition to remnants of the fort and the bell tower is also a cemetery with about 350 graves have been discovered, which probably belonged to the church.

EU Commission proposes in row over new court TTIP
To defuse the dispute over the planned trans-Atlantic free trade agreement, TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration institutions for resolving disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system, which is far more traditional in its functioning.
"We want to establish a system, the trust of the citizens," declared the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m at the launch.
The Swede has, to put forward the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free-trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
Via TTIP is intended to create the largest free-trade zone in the world, with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration specifically stipulate that the EU countries and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are in equal parts from the EU, the US and from non-EU countries.
Is also scheduled for the first time a second resort.
It would make it possible to collect judgments against the opposition.
So far, the procedures involved with each other on the referee, it was not an appeal against their sentences.
In the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens of the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice are not trusted, MalmstrÃ¶m said.
In the long term, it wants to work towards an international investment court according to their own.
There could then be addressed, for example, also disputes between Chinese companies and EU states.
In particular, required by large corporations, investor-state arbitration (ISDS) is considered one of the main reasons for the huge resistance to TTIP in Europe.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, on the corporate compensation at the expense of the taxpayer can wrest, national laws to nullify or a lowering of consumer protection and environmental standards.
In early statements anti-TTIP organizations like Campact described the proposals by the EU Commission as inadequate.
It was criticized, in particular, that they should not apply to the already-negotiated free-trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German economy StaatssekretÃ¤r Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission has taken into account in the reform of key points, the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel is working with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration was off the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of MalmstrÃ¶m.
The European companies ' organization warned that the action potential of the economy by restricting too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized businesses could be adversely affected, it said.
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be completed on Wednesday, remained unclear.
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
The issue of protection of investors, however, has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Originally, there should be a framework for the agreement as early as the end of this year.
This date is regarded as no longer tenable.
Delicate folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago sits Sufjan Stevens on stage at the Cologne-based Prime Club (now: Luxor).
He was standing next to a flip chart, which has recorded the shy-looking folk the picturesque US state of Michigan with a felt-tip pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, was almost taken by Stevens lectures.
He recounts in the different places that he is still drawing on the map, which will report its meticulously and delicately arranged songs.
Where they are born and how it looks like there, in his home.
Since then, Stevens is proving to be a wonderfully creative.
With the 2003 and third album, "greetings From Michigan: the Great Lake State" appear wise composed songs that nestles snugly close to American folk music of the late sixties, but each time drifting into great opulent.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" would be the first part of an audacious series: each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row.
But back in 2004 and in the Rhine River near Seven Swans " has already been released and breaks some positive expectations.
We are reduced to Stevens.
Meet him live guitar and banjo.
A year later, returns to the New-York-based musicians back to the series.
"Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: come on Feel the Illinoise") is a universally acclaimed masterpiece of 2005.
Exuberant in ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album is rising in the US Billboard Charts and is lacking in any year best list of influential music media.
After very productive experiments Stevens then operated on "the Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic sets.
This sixth proper studio album is still wide, but orchestrated by programmed sequences or beats and playing with all sorts of effects and reverb.
Long emerged from the smaller clubs, the stage shows are here for the colourful spectacle of neon-head bands and big fluorescent BÃ¼hnendeko.
Currently touring Sufjan Stevens as part of a five-member band from Germany.
In the dark kept hamburger added!!!
Theatre presents he receives mainly since March, "Carrie & Lowell."
Although there are now nearly 2000 guests spellbound in their stools, the returns become much more mature Stevens back to the intimacy and the Folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians playing the album widely.
From the audience hears: the talk was "extravagant" and "throw away" the disk is basically.
Only one encore says modestly, Stevens plays acoustically few older songs and finally bowed under thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut with the Prime Minister's Question Time awaits with anticipation
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is making his debut in the Prime Minister's Question Time with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to the first of his six predetermined questions shortly after noon, and probably his performance by the media and the Labour MEPs will be examined closely.
He called for "less theatrical and more facts on this weekly event."
He also said that he could skip some meetings in order to leave them to colleagues.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC's annual conference on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision by the Labour leader, on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a memorial ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, in silence, criticism from a number of Tory MPs has provoked and lies at the heart of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem, has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence," and he acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader, to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they cite differences in economic, defence and foreign policy, while less than one sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences within Labour "pile up" after Mr Corbyn's comments on the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that presenting Labour amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap as a whole.
Hours later, said Mr. Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from Â£ 26000 to Â£ 23000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader, David Cameron, since he became Tory leader, in the last decade across the Dispatch Box in the House.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and have given him more than 30000 comments.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he is both "repartee" and refrain from the dispute with barbs and instead has to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business minister, will replace him when he is not taking part - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also presented the idea that others sometimes take the floor, and that he was John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, raised, in order to discuss the problem.
In 2005, when he was leader, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to move away from the politics in the style of a "Punchinello-Theater," which is often linked to the questions of the Prime Minister, but a few years later, he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time was seen with the Prime Minister as the main barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, even though critics have argued that it is become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
In Joburg ' bullets ': homeless young people educated to photographers

Pound rises by accelerating wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose jump after data showing a rise in wage growth in the UK. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was boosted by bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July the outcome without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9% over the same period last year.
This percentage was the fastest since 2009 and provided estimates of the timing of an interest-rate increase.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro climbed to 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49%.
SABMiller was the outstanding shares on the market and jumped by 20% after takeover offer was made by the rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were higher after encouraging news from the rival company for luxury goods Richemont 0.9%.
Richemonts latest sales figures beat expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - reported growth.
Shares in Glencore rose by 5% after the mining giant said that it had 2.5 billion dollars through a share sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decline of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had set its assessment of the company's rating to "sell."
JD Sports rose by 3.1%, after the sports clothing company reported for the half-year pre-tax earnings of 46.6 million.
The boss of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers "could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The costs could affect the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, megastar.
A mere 21 years old, a HÃ¤nfling with oberschicker Frise.
The guy with the platinum-blonde hair is EUR 100 million.
Rather, even more.
Is Monsieur Bieber currently in Berlin.
And the generation of U17 rotates.
As Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7.00 a.m., however, the Pole is sitting on the cold stone slabs from a luxury hotel in Berlin at the Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-construction: it is her idol, whose poster hung in Szczecin, herded together since Monday evening.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer, lives on the same day costs as much as her mum Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
The says: "actually, my Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth grade in high school."
"I am fulfilling a dream."
Compulsory education?
Who itches?
Not the fans.
Even Bieber himself does not.
The already is outdated now.
He earn three million for advertising during the commercial break of the Superbowls, a two-year deal with an anti-pimple-company washed many, many dollars at Bieber's account.
And for every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber also collects.
If Justin Bieber is drinking a coffee, you marvel at the windowpane.
More than 100 million he is supposed to have.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is currently in the US and Britain with his new single "what do you mean?" To Number 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due in November, follow the many zeros not interested.
At least that way he does.
Pegida brings Lebanese poster to KartoffeldÃ¶ner idea
Potatoes or DÃ¶ner?
It is both - and in the KartoffeldÃ¶ner has developed the Oldenburg snack bar owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the slogan "potatoes rather than dÃ¶ner" on a poster of the Pegida movement has Alhay potatoes and meat on a skewer.
The idea made him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of DÃ¶ner," which he had seen on television.
Since then, his shop is in a GrillspieÃ, which is stocked with meat and potatoes.
"This is multicultural in the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now joined the Lebanese in the Patent Office in Munich.
There, it is protected, according to the agency as a utility model.
How much meat and how much potatoes contain the skewer, Alhay not betrayed.
Just as much: "it tastes even better together," he finds it.
The culinary world understanding well even among his customers.
Metcash launches BodenstÃ¤ndigkeits campaign to combat incursions by Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores in an Aldi-rally in South Australia and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a BodenstÃ¤ndigkeits-campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a 700 million $ Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares for the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, strengthen Metcash and IGA supermarkets, their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand through IGA mainstream marketing and marketing on social media, as well on events such as Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Eishersteller Simmo from Dunsborough, distributed the samples in IGA stores and shop owners to sell cheap tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash further details of his defense strategy, published on September 29, when the wholesale distributor of food, alcohol and equipment conducts its annual investor Strategietag.
There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia generate nearly 30 percent, and higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the Oststaat of Metcashs IGA store shops.
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously insular and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia, compared to around 14 percent in the Oststaat.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi is twelve months after opening its first markets snapped up around five percent of the food market in those two states, and all the existing players, but mostly independent retailers will take away sales.
A report published this week estimated that the analyst Tom Kierath from Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million could lose by the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi opened 25 stores next year in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $500 million and $600 million will be in every market.
The loss in the food business and the volume of Metcashs high fixed-cost base could Metcash around $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time loses Metcash market share in the Oststaat, primarily at Aldi and Coles, although a recent poll by Roy Morgan found that IGA shoppers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs sales in the food business by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in the year 2018 will fall and the market share of 14 percent to 10.3% in 2015-2020 will be reduced.
Last week told the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade. Metcash.
Metcash declined to publicly respond to the comments of Mr. Douglass.
But it is believed that a board member of Metcash has recorded with Mr. Douglass last week.
IGAs market share has fallen from 18 per cent since 2010 to 14 percent, and income from Metcashs food trade, which supplies roughly 1200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, which reflects the operational deleverage at the same time, pressure on sales and margins.
The big retailers are fighting back, however, and has invested more than $150 million to improve selling prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week to assimilate and IGA retailers to improve their shops by faster growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private-label foods.
Metcashs chief executive Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and remediation programs at Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will in 2017 for the first time in four years to return to profit growth.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and the opinion of the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo that is repeatedly described as "special K," the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters spotlight.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon afterwards had Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison divorced twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaim: "Wawrinka should have Kyrgios beat, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen, as he smashed a tennis racket, after a spasm thwarted a potential US Open victory of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth in the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"One thing that I am pretty ereifere is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi a little was dragged into the dispute," said Healy.
He has broken a racquet when he lost because of a cramp in the U.S. Open, but he is not the first player who broke a racquet in frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he is in the US Open has behaved extremely well, even among the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much credit.
He has a great team around them, he has a great family around them, and I believe that he was a little harsh.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he is working very hard, and he fits into the team, and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in Umkleidebereich, he trained hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be on its own merits.
Healy also supported the decision, Kyrgios in failing to take into account the important qualifiers, which starts on Friday, and he describes the " joint decision " as a right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra, to return as a long-term is an integral part of the team. "
"First, we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not at all the controversy around it [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I believe that Nick has risen quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time outside of the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best thing for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes the border, refugees return
Hungary declared a state of emergency and drops from the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants gather in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who fled from violence, got stuck for an unknown period of time in a strip of land on the road between the two countries control points and erected tents and settled down there.
But frustrations grew.
As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanting "open the border!" And shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some lawn in protest of food and water.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said that it was "unacceptable" that migrants were sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not the collateral damage.
It must take place in the coming days, talks with Brussels and other countries, " said Ivica Dacic, in Prague.
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc at a contentious meeting in Brussels to agree on a common immigration policy.
The minister, however, agreed to share the responsibility for the 40000 people who sought refuge in Ã¼berrumpelt Italy and Greece, they expressed their hope that finally - next month - or until the end of the year reached an agreement that the EU states would pick up a further 120000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Chancellor Angela Merkel, Austria, on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union, to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
Hungary was not, however, his hopes for a speedy action by Brussels or by its neighbors.
The state of emergency on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so they closed off roads and were able to speed up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said meanwhile that his country is also building a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania plan to stop the influx of migrants across the country, once it has completed a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D 'Agata reported that even prison inmates in the race to build a barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia, have been used.
In recent months, Hungary for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a major bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most of the incoming economic migrants who are in search of a better life, and not war refugees, are entitled to protection - a view that is sharply at odds with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, to make the crossing the border or become damaged in the 4-meter (13 foot) high fence, the government built along the southern border with Serbia, to a crime, these laws also set higher sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation that is caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declared the misery," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it very clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament must still approve procedural or the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters from the Associated Press have seen on the border of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country-security consultant for Orban, said that authorities have 45 people while trying to cross the border were seized, 15 others have penetrated deeper into the country.
They come across by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are being accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are working to fix the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a train cars had arrived with barbed wire to close the borders.
Chaos surrounding the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and a crowd of people pressed to get hineindrÃ¤ngen.
About 20 were to join, but thousands were left outside.
Another group of migrants, blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in the national poll, halved
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead over the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground to her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (an increase of 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he ran for president, receives the support of 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, the majority of Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their feelings are clear, which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more persistent in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders scored some gains.
Clinton holds a strong lead among women and moderates, but the margin has narrowed.
Their support among men has fallen markedly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
However, Clinton still has a large advantage for older voters.
Last month, Clinton was Sanders, with double-digit lead for the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point margin in this group.
About half of Democratic voters in the primaries across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support it only because she is the nominee.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters in particular are fascinated by her.
The views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries say they support Clinton enthusiastically, fewer Republican voters say about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters will be asked in an open question as to why they want to, that she is the candidate, the most common answer is that it has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman President (13 percent) and that it is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Of Clinton's supporters also mentions its connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Support for dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also cited.
As the Vice President raises the potential for the presidency in the balance, 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries would like to see him in the race - even though one-third believes that he should not do it.
If the democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the helm.
Supporters of Clinton's more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's increased ahead of Sanders, 20 points, with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this figure has fallen from 78 per cent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measure, but the percentage that sees him as the "wÃ¤hlbarsten," has risen.
However, with the question of what is important in a candidate, Democratic voters cite issues of eligibility.
Much like last month stands out, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for the primaries, these voters as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results in some of the important features of their party primaries with voters.
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden raises the three best candidates for honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many people say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters in the primaries, in general, see also Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all of these measurements, around a quarter of Democratic voters do not agree with Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during the term of office as Secretary of State, the majority of Democratic voters are satisfied with the primaries with their explanation of the issue and say that it has not influenced their opinions.
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one-third is satisfied.
Public opinion was divided on this in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of it was even worse.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six in 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this is still a problem for them among a total of registered voters: only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 fewer points since May.
62 percent of those eligible do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the electorate can see across the country including Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, received good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested Biden, Carson and Bush score best with honesty.
A majority of Sanders looks more honest than that, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is in nationwide poll close behind on Donald Trump
Ben Carson is located in the latest poll from CBS News/New York Times behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now accounts for half the support of voters in the new poll, and others dramatically lose grip
Support of Republican voters nationwide continue to Trump in great numbers, there is growing support in the latest CBS poll, the Fox News debate last month was carried out by 23%, 27% in the poll on Tuesday.
But Carson leapt from 6% in the same period to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson does well with demographic groups and surpasses Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is teeing off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen on the deepest, and the support of 10% to now 2% last month.
The former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are 6% in the third place.
The error margin for the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6 percent and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he ends up with 19% support among Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
With a view to a rising in the last week, Carson found some Seitenhieb for Trump's former neurosurgeon, even after apologies for Carson, Trump's faith in question.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.

Five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Baruch College-tainted newcomer
Almost two years after a student during a ritual bullying a student liaison in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, died, murder charges will be filed against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Fraternity Chun "Michael" Deng during a brutal initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police said.
Officials said he had been charged with a 30-pound backpack full of sand with eyes blindfolded, and had been repeatedly attacked, while he tried to reach out to a goal on a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches, he then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Fraternity called the emergency number 911, fainted after Deng and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police.
However, they had the time to move on to Deng's clothes, googled his symptoms and Andy Meng, to contact the national president of the Brotherhood in order to catch up with the Council, the police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide equipment and the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about the Michael Deng," said Police Chief Wagner.
He could not be revived and he died of his injuries the next morning.
After an autopsy report, Deng has been repeatedly inflicted by blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the bullying of the Brotherhood, at least one student dies every year since 1970 to the bullying," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, also indicted for vexatious attacks and forming a criminal organisation.
"We do not want to blame the people involved, but only if there is an organization that - officially or unofficially - has sanctioned this, so we will hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked its affiliation to the group.
This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
A rate increase is coming, and the bull market will falter, yields on bonds will rise and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long all this and how long it will continue.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance to the end.
A recession came in just 11 months after the first interest rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how to respond to the economy and the financial assets.
Therefore, representatives of the Federal Reserve have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather on the period that is necessary for the normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end of the market participants, however, may find that the outburst may have been exaggerated because of an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase by the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money "," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at a low level, in order to lead to a seismic shock that many appear to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a look at historical trends based on how some parts of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems to me that there is a tendency that asset returns will choke off 12 to 24 months after the first hike, which perhaps reflects the delay in the monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens to interest rate hikes by the Fed.
More specifically, the market is pretty flat over the past 35 years, mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest rates, then the 250 days (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average rate of return over the last six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, in Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stock tends to occur later in the cycle and increase the rate of return that is beginning to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rates often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with a number of conditions, which did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.
Most remarkable is that the GDP will be close to its lowest point in a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank was among the 118 rate hikes only twice since 1950, the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect that this will continue and we expect for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed, only 1.5 percent.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of whether "this time it is different," said Deutsche Bank.
Participants in the market throughout the year have been caught on a Fed rate hike, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC might approve an increase in this session, futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in terms of GDP and the pre-recession highs very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shadows," says the report.
In contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are so far 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates a rate increase, and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect is faster in bonds than in stocks, though the change its strategic direction.
The returns on bonds seem to change direction, as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle, increasing bond yields will fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
The strategists of Charles Schwab, believe that the increase in interest rates will mean that yields between longer and shorter bonds closer to one another and lead to a tailing off of the curve.
High-yielding bonds often yield better returns, even though "we still are cautious to expect higher returns in such a climate," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting that Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and the volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightened its strategy.
By and large, companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US, stands to benefit if interest rates rise and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, because a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market, as well as the financing of its debt.
"History shows that the" quality "stocks tend to respond very positively, three months after an initial increase in interest rates," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for the client.
Companies with strong balance-sheet companies with weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004 exceeded an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns and lower volatility in their stocks outperform their counterparts with lower quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is a big problem.
Companies with a high degree of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside of the pure stock of games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even though experts are divided on how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for its "dumbing down"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also was aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she only imitated The Brit
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that it was not very clever.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament and new increased pressure on the broadcaster, to prove that he does something that the private sector do not.
The Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public service radio station "verdumme" and increasingly impossible to distinguish from its commercial counterparts.
"Seems to be Radio 3 - I use the word" verdummen "does not like to - but it seems to be turning to Classic FM," he said.
It also was aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which began last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, appears only at The Brit to be under a different name.
So, if you try to do something different - these are spontaneously mentioned two examples where you actually just mimic what is already on the market, " said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director-General dismissed the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors, when it comes to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, I am going anywhere else to learn about classical music.
And there is a commitment to live music and making music that is truly unmatched.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and new works in order to give, I feel really important," he said.
Earlier this year argued the BBC Radio 3 controller Alan initally composed using Davey that it should be harder to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC production, which came under fire during the hearing at the Committee for the selection of Culture, Media and Sport to commercial rivals on the toes.
The Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent of the BBC show, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds.
You will see why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - "in a special BBC-produced" way.
He added that he hoped that the company "a hit in our own barn find," if it is the next time you start a conversation.
However, he refused to rule out the purchase of a further series of The Voice in the future or money from the fee payers to spend on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose in August at the slowest and the Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there were seven per cent rise in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales grew three years ago by the use of mobile phones to shop
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has put the brakes on spending
For more than a decade, the virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say that there are now signs that the online sales will stagnate, after new figures showed only seven per cent in the first three months of 2015.
The total spending for August, the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 with only a five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales will stagnate, after new figures show only 7% growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous year, and go back to 2000, it has evolved over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the Guardian IMRG-sales index.
He said that online sales increased three years ago, when buyers started with their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were able to shop online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the couch.
But now it is leveling off, and we will probably see that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for the declining revenues.
Experts believe that, buyers keep their purchases before the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, rallied five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bargains, and some retailers ' websites plummeted.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyers fight for bargains could deter buyers to make purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that spending by Â£ 5 a bit more than Â£ 1 was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one-third of purchases are now being carried out on web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chain in the inner cities.
Muslims bury the Bin Laden family in Mecca - the crane accident killed is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 deaths of Muslims at the first burial in Mecca carried through the streets
Saudi Arabia sets the collapse of part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group on load
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered, when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca Grand Mosque.
Grieving, largely filled up dressed in white, the route to pay their respects, as the first of the dead begin their final journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The funeral procession moved over to the holy site, where only days before a crane through the roof of the mosque and then rushed to the prayer.
The bodies were released to the funeral, when the Saudi king Bin Laden because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured, a sanction imposed on the builders of the family.
The bodies of 29 beter, who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca, were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, a father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage, when the crane crashed down.
Mr Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage in the Grand Mosque.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city, will continue.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin Laden group would not leave the arm of a crane when he was not used.
An Arab version of the decree, which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency reported that detail, but said that the leadership of the company were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the crane that collapsed in a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims from the Hajj pilgrimage, which takes place later this month, gathered.
The Bin Laden group has issued no statements about the crane collapse, and their representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also chided the group not because of current security measures and because they have not partnered with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounded Mecca Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project, which is led by the Bin Laden group.
The Bin Laden family is linked to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and assumes larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son, who in the 1990s was disowned by the family.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the UK for the pilgrimage at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim is required.
Officials said that 158 people remain in hospital.
Government officials are ordered to pay 1 million rial (Â£ 174000) to the families of the deceased is the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injuries will receive half of that amount.
B & Q boss says that the era of cheap Eastern European tradesmen is over
Britons are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified tradesmen from Eastern Europe has been rising behind it
The result is that 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at tradesmen,
At the same time, Kingfisher 60 B & Q stores nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons their hammer and paintbrush in favor of the use of skilled Eastern European workers, who carry out the work in their homes,
If you can cope with a hammer or a brush to the painting of walls, these days you seem to be a minority.
Because Brits are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their own homes, the head of the company behind B & Q.
VÃ©ronique Laury, new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the hardware store chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified tradesmen from Eastern Europe, the services offered at rock-bottom prices is now obsolete.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at tradesmen and 60 outlets to close from B & Q.
Mrs. Laury said that she wanted to employ more women in B & Q stores, because eight out of ten purchases in the store are made by women.
At the moment, men predominate among employees.
She said it was necessary to confront the growing demographic trends that more female single households, carry out the renovation, more than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said: " it is still a majority of men in our stores.
This is something we need to move more toward a balance.
In principle, there is half of our customers from women with 80% of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, one of only five women at the head of a leading British companies in the FTSE100 index, has listed their top team umstruktiert to reflect an equal number of men and women in positions of leadership.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team filled with women, including its corporate governance and financial management.
Mrs. Laury said: " this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women on our board.
Kingfisher has reported a decline in half-year profits and revenues after the group shouldering the costs of closing the stores.
Because of the trends, Kingfisher, Screwfix and B & Q, is to open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob due to infidelity in court
The Klagenfurt district court on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice-Master Aich/Dob due to infidelity and tax evasion.
The well-known defendants are not guilty.
One of them was also charged with abuse of office.
By this accusation, he has been effectively cleared last May.
The current trial was postponed.
According to prosecutor Robert Riffel had emerged in the preliminary examination that the defendants in the years 2006-2011 funds of club accounts, on which they were allowed in their functions, used for private purposes.
He estimated the damage at around 400000 euros.
The sports officials are also accused of financial crimes.
This fact blew the chairman of the Senate jury, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
To discard the infidelity, the defense argued that the club was at no time a fortune.
The sports officials have charged only allowances and the sports club, for which they have been operating from 1982 to 2011 and they have invested a lot of time and money, out of the debt - the liabilities amounted to 600000 in 2001, Schilling (approximately 44000 euros).
"Then we were faced with the situation: we continue to lead the club or we terminate?," said one of the defendants, in a large bread professional auditor of the Financial District.
He and his colleague and co have decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We have money, upfronted our life insurance as collateral at the bank," he said at the hearing.
With the club, it was agreed that they can manage the money, it may only be made no debt.
Furthermore, with adequate financial success - the payment of the allowances retroactive to 1991 had been decided.
Therefore, it is a part of the allowances only years later, in the year 2003, when an increase in the bank account had been paid off.
So, too, seemed flat and not Detailabbuchungen, explained the former chairman of the operations.
The managed accounts and savings books together, the two defendants, said the second defendant.
Why the payouts, the club have not been disclosed in detail, asked the judge.
The club was not interested in the details of the finances, important only if the debt was freedom, according to the answer.
In 2011, as against the began an official investigation for abuse of office, was paid an amount of EUR 120000 on the association's bank account.
The reserves have been declared the defendants.
This securities account amounted to the name of the second defendant and was not known, according to its statement to the club.
"Why?" The judge wanted to know.
The respondent knew no answer.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known something of this money, the prosecutor in the room.
The co was informed, the official added.
This transfer was phrased as "damage reparation."
Why? Concept, judge and public prosecutor wanted to know.
This is the first defendant stated that he was not satisfied with this wording, because the club would never have suffered damage.
But what do I do if the lawyer says: "you are all off the hook."
"I am a lawyer?" He asked.
In addition, the official said that he never got a cent of salary, he was charged only mileage allowance and diets.
He attended the club salary of EUR 1000 per month, the actual cost was much higher, however, he added.
Accurate records for the early years of the defendants were not present.
They are following a business review, in which everything has been judged to be correct, was not kept, they said.
Miles also had money in the second defendant.
All of the fixes were in cash that he had to travel from his home international market to the bank after Bleiburg, he declared in his statement.
The main negotiations will resume on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.

RÃ¶szke: violence erupted in Serb-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have deployed to the Serbian border at RÃ¶szke tear gas and water cannons against hundreds of angry refugees.
Euronews correspondent DÃ¡niel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border check point.

Time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching, when the US Federal Reserve in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, come together to make the important decision as to whether, for the first time in nearly a decade, the interest rate will be raised or not.
A survey of 80 economists, who were interviewed by Reuters, found that a little more than half, which only last week was of the view that the Fed will do this, now thinks that the Fed will still remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the present level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It is a historic event, because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates to zero.
"For the first time we are approaching a situation in which a major central bank may leave the zero area and starts the process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance status, trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate a low inflation.
However, the Fed can not ignore the less rosy view of global relationships.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the evidence suggests that the chances are good against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 8.00 p.m. CET on Thursday
Shooter at Delta State University left behind letters of apology
After the shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and later in the day before shooting and killing his colleagues - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" do at the first murder, "and he could undo it," said authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, the emergency number around 10: 00 am on Monday morning call
And said he had shot at someone and killed someone.
Lamb said the emergency call centre staff that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that a "sweet" dog in the house, but "no one will bother," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not have it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a hand written note from Lamb, 45, who said: " I am sorry, I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me. "
After writing the note Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday night, when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course, there was something in Mr. Lambs notion."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" of a "triangular relationship."
Prentiss was Shawn O ' Steen, who testified that they were married about seven years, described as a "good man."
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O ' Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "devastated".
He said that Prentiss her daughter was "absolutely the best of friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Herald Sun as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, met with lamb for about three years ago.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb telephoned relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "he did not go to jail."
When police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a pistol.
Lamb was awarded in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University, a PhD, as its Lebenslau on the website of the university.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double-fracture
Luke Shaw suffered in the Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven Manchester a double fracture of his right leg.
While this brought the left-side defenders cry and will preclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is not in the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The breach was caused by a reckless attack by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "he has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be tomorrow, or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it is very difficult and it is fantastic, and then this happens.
In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He wept.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
I hope that he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee has not punished, the Mexicans.
Van Gaal conjectured that the Italian referee had got it wrong.
You can judge for themselves, when I say that were a penalty and a red card.
It was a very serious attack with both feet.
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "I would like to thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how I am broke, my road to recovery begins now, I will come back stronger."
Referring to this: Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
The England defender has been with the European Championships in France an extra incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach said: "it is a very serious violation."
If a player with that kind of injury leaves the place, are all very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture, when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the World Cup in 2014.
"It is very difficult, because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and then, when you hear that it is a very serious injury, that is not good," said Cocu.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was in a different direction, so that it looked as if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with Moreno SBS6 said: " I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be anything.
I feel very bad. I am so sorry.
The PSV player AndrÃ©s Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a foul play by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron certainly knows better, The Lorax?
It is one thing all parents soon learn: if your child loves a book, it will not be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless perhaps you are David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax, published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr Seuss graced.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super Camps, and continues: "funny, emotional, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I read to my children, because it always seems to be an image or a message that we have missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead, a summary of the film version of 2012, which added new characters and details, in order to expand the original text is rather short.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all of nature is gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by their desire to see a real tree," reads one, a love interest was Dr. Seuss graced, whose real name was Theodor Seuss graced hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that weren't suspicious enough: the text proposed by Cameron reads in part, as the summary of the Lorax-film, which will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database, and so begins: "in the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is the plot of the book is so unfamiliar, here is an unnamed boy listens, as the local environment by the money-grabbing fourth guessing, trees, Thneed knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the name Lorax, a huddled, his essence, "which speaks on behalf of the trees," is devastated.
It was highly likely that such a relatively low PR task delegated to a worker who has read The Lorax not 20 times in a row, to a child.
A Downing Street spokesperson said that the text was likely to have come from Cameron's constituency office.
Super camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but there was no further immediate comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's squad, but it is still difficult to
In the United Arab Emirates to Pakistan, is a difficult task, but if you have selected the squad, England for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map.
I would not rule out an away victory.
Alastair Cook's side is probably less than three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting position, and the community spirit is strong; they will bear no scars of 2012, only a youthful, positive attitude.
With the ball develops Moeen Ali as a spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at test level, is an option for the attack.
This related news: Adam Lyth leaves the England test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is, of course, for me, as his head coach, in Yorkshire, and difficult to analyse.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There was no question mark when Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I have said this earlier - players are their own best chooser.
Long ago we could have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he beats out other runs for Yorkshire, comes another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if it is not so good services rendered, and it does not surprise me; above all, he is a team man.
The question of how much time a test-shot man gets to put his characters is difficult.
Lyth had seven opportunities - such as Sam Robson - in front of him, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only criticism one can gather, was that England was Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean began - as Lyth in top shape - but that lost opportunity now lies in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a man who shot, which I appreciate.
He is an X-factor-cricket players, what we saw in Yorkshire early this season, when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge Square, which hit us very much.
He must be at least given the same opportunities as those in front of him, but, of course, this depends on the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in addition to Cook, which would receive an extra spin Bowler and four Quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a man can't beat, and this left-handed has already shown that he is a hell of a guy of cricket players.
Moeen has perhaps done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he is not a number 3 for them, and there is no difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played in his first 38 tests at first drop, before he emerged in 2001 as an opener.
He has managed three hundred runs straight away and not looked back.
Zafar Ansari is in the squad as a back-up spinner, and he has impressed me as a young man in my limited dealings with him.
People may see his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a punt, but there is no large number of backup spinner who raise their hands, and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the England team has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the trial games could be a champion.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, which will bring a wealth of experience, because he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming to the white ball-stage of the Tour and brings energy and a strong commitment to the environment.
I have always felt that he is created for international cricket competition as a player or a coach, and how Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes, new voices in the dressing room bring a breath of fresh air, even if the messages are consistent with the above.
Collys teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, is used in the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and, for my part, I have no problem with that.
Some people will not agree, but coaches and Teamaufsteller do not determine the timetable.
And you must bear in mind that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are taken not blithely.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = Britain's exit from the EU) could win, if the economy is in a slump until the year 2017 device
David Cameron's ill-thought-out Neuverhandlungs Strategy, in order to keep Britain in the EU, will be deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "it is yes or no?" Corbyn for leader of Labour and the TUC, because Europe is fiercely divided on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have Corbyn's and Nigel Farage's.
A European diplomat friend said recently that some member states that are so deeply enmeshed in various crises, such as the EU, it is now, and not always from their own guilt, Britain's self-created agenda with divided concessions and disruptive changes to the Treaty, which they mostly do not want to.
In Brighton the TUC decided at their annual meeting that it may, if they do not jeopardize the social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie-agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbed on summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, a photograph of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reform.
It is always about me.
My European friend who wants an outside-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "let us not only with France," says Berlin - and hints that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they do not care whether we stay or go.
Cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is an ally, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them, as happened with the overly long Ausharrende like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's FranÃ§ois Hollande looks back on his re-election or its replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, a left-wing Spain.
It is hard to imagine that they will pull a leg to help the Selfie-Brits whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they do not want to, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
So maybe some even planning such ministers deliberately unhelpful comments, quite the SNP-style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017, in order to speed up the process of Brexit, my friend.
"The renegotiation was a bust," and "the UK has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU sceptics is the oligarchy of press barons, as they have during the referendum in 1975, inspired by Tony Benn but were not supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
They can be weak recall Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunist, who has made a name for himself as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
For all its craziness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
A Medley of tax-fearing-rogues, phone-hacked foreigners and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought much about it, but found that, if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distributed bananas to distract him, rather than to his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairianer than Blair himself, when he opposed Cameron's referendum, because Blair was the principle on which the EU Constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, he opened a back door.
He has never forgiven the press.
But to me the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who in Westminster on Monday gave a friendly pat on the back - I told him that he needs to waste no more time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy in the 80's, then and now is a mistake.
It can take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win over the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, the BBC sofa he has left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I am - it is in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukips traditional blue dye-trend and the wild climes of young Tory EnglÃ¤nderismus everyone can probably say yes.
That is what Hilary said "a Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and on television this week, when the Scouts fought in it, not admitting that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father is on television trying to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without having to go too far and his Kabinettsjob to lose.
Hilarys struggle was still attractive.
But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benns expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his supporters and members at its closing session on Monday evening, according to all reports.
Whatever the rÃ¼hrselig bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he has even touched me - news-discipline remains in the era of TV around the clock, important and, above all, in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is true that Cameron is not a free ticket to Europe, which allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity to EU membership - in line with its Bennite Belagerungs-economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.
As with its ambiguity to NATO - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC will start a campaign for secession - foreign diplomats will be obligated to try to find at home, in particular, a sense of their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin, wasting political capital - they have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the lack of military service in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, I was reminded at the launch on Monday of what is called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Allegations of a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined Lancet, by criticizing the evidence used in her report on e-cigarettes from Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published the "principle" report last month, and describes him as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the strength of the data and pointed to the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the basis of "very windy," founded on the PHE his main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the allegations are based on "stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Ãffentlichde Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape Motherwell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that the assertion of PHE, that "the current best estimate is that around 95% of e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking," based on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to guide their opinions about the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Cape well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health, previously the managing director of British American Tobacco (BAT) have asked for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT in a sustainability report to public health, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that to receive funds from a e-cigarette manufacturers, but not the funding, which he previously reported to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not provided, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which are also an industry funding provided in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
At the meeting was also attended by the tobacco industry led by PHE.
The research work of the group "significantly," admits that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Cape.
However, none of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Cape well said that the allegations of PHE that "so far, there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers were" premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that it was already responding to the claims of BMJ.
He said: "e-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
One in two life-long smoker dies from his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes, in comparison, are small, but we have to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System Â£ 2 billion per year.
Through the clear presentation of the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we meet our national responsibility.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, he said that commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for public service programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in solid timeframe against the most popular shows of their rivals and channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC's Director General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had been trying for six years during his time at Channel 4, without success, to come into contact with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes or broadcasts, which were also shown clearly by not subsidised rivals," said Johnson, the House of Lords Communication Committee as part of its study on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, what I believe in the medium or long term is not a good idea, you should at least take his production on programs that others do not make or commission.
They send out The Voice in a prime-time window because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show that this is a joke, it is ridiculous, of course it is nonsense.
Johnson said: " I do not see why a regressive tax funded programs that could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly, both in-house productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for that.
I am doing my best to see how this is supposed to be public service television.
I do not think that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a contractor for the series, led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the pursuit of ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts give back what was the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-service niche programmes on BBC4 should go, " where one cannot fairly judge the audience, but they can fulfil their tasks, and they argue that if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion Â£ broadcasting fees, " well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has ever seen. "
They put them in a window of time in which no one ever wanted to see them.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: " I call on you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value here.
Of course, you all think that we all think that for Â£ 150 per year here gets a great value, but for people who are a lot of money for the Â£ 150, wonder if that is true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to inform, educate and entertain "."
He said that only a little of the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that there were 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should take a leaf out of the publicly-owned television stations in Australia and Canada, change it to "inform, educate and entertain."
On the issue of partnerships, said Elstein, the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and alliances with the commercial channels, in order to make everything available online.
' Sonogenetics ' brain cells can be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically-modified nerve systems, which can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment, in which they are irradiated with sonic pulses for human hearing at high frequencies, in order to be heard.
The impetus to work through the activation of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels, which react to ultrasonic waves.
Read more on this subject: the research and writing brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worm showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The blisters, he found, increase the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves on structures, the TRP-4 called ion channels, and found some of the worms in the cell membranes.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, as a report in Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-guided nematodes, genetically-modified Chalasani wear the worms so that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels.
If he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the MikroblÃ¤schen and transferred to the worms, where they switch on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, a cutting-edge tool that allows scientists to neurons with pulses of light and off.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technology.
In contrast to the light that revealed in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain has to be low-frequency ultrasound waves unimpeded tissue and can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the angezielt human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right at your doorstep!
Shame the UK's advertising arms trade
Amnesty International's anti-arms trade shows-video.
Horrible killer-drone!!!
Ankle-smashing leg shackles!!!
Cluster bombs!!!
And electric shock sticks, causing agonising pain, but leave no trace behind.
The cheerful voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this display for the world's largest arms fair is a combative parody, which was produced by Amnesty International, the British government's willingness to bring the spotlight to sold arms to repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in subway trains, which require a second look.
"Important notice: go from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) you read in the characters of the London Underground and the DLR's trademark line, which converts the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers with the DLR... customers will be asked to help stop the Arms Fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the museum for cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A group called the Special Patrol Group, helped in the distribution in London and used "ad Space Hack Packs", a Â£ 6-pack of InbusschlÃ¼sseln, from which it is claimed that "access to about a third of the bus-advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London this Plakatier- "vandalism" is not funny.
One of the parody ads, was produced by the Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will be more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists do with activists in protest movements to work and notice that they have to go out into the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms-trade-posters greet commuters on the tube.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, the nonprofit works with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP-creative director Matt Lever was surprised by the silence that prevailed around the advertising of the arms fair - by a space of the ExCeL-calendar - and thought: "we are giving them the campaign that they are trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a realistic shady corporate advertising, but it remains more liable "by the EinblÃ¤uen with bright colors and animation."
"You have done a fantastic job, by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the show," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors euphemistic fantastic products sold off.
In a press release Saab revealed a mission of the US Army on "the RS downed AT4CS from the shoulder."
These include a "uniquely shaped warhead, the prominent Nachwirkungs effects inside the goal."
Whatever the causes, it will not be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for students living in residence halls
Eleven years ago, when I pulled myself forget 19-year-old in a student dormitory, still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the strained smile of those who I have offended - and the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned, can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The indentation in student residences ranging from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to chatting, telling people where you are coming from, whether and where you have taken sabbatical, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you love "to be honest neither Marmite nor hate, because seriously, guys, it is just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I am in my room."
Do not breathe.
And help others to do the same - you questions and you show interest.
It distracts the conversation and helps you find the people who you would like, in contrast to those with whom you do not talk, even if your eyelashes were on fire and that fire extinguishers.
Let people.
The rooms of people often turn into drinks receptions, film-night venues and local venues, but they are also the places where people get dressed up and her underwear.
Referring to this: do not forget to start at the university with a relationship
Introvertierte received a harsh treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a room-to-room walk-in culture, which is friendly and socially responsible and can lead to life-long friendship.
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say: "I like you, and I want to continue our friendship, but you have to leave, so I get the energy back, which I have used for the interaction with you."
You try to knock on when a fellow students of sociability is exhausted - and send him a text message.
Speaking of knock: just do it.
A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a door is not closed to an invitation.
He saw a couple of things.
Close friendship through baking.
As you begin the university at the height of the back-mania, is the knock on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate of brownies, less strange than the greeting of the 1950s- "welcome in the neighborhood, I have baked something to you, and please smile now when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade goodies is a good way to make friends.
Her roommate feel obliged to entertain and perhaps end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed up clumps of flour, sugar and fat mean that people are asleep, when you knock on the door.
To steal food, is a common crime in student residence halls.
Of course, the hoof is a theft of chicken, but it is the capture of a drop of Milchs for your tea too?
Check the milk with the owner.
The chances are good that they say to themselves, even if they cook at home.
If someone steals your stuff, that is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but you are trying to deal with it more balanced than my resident who added their milk a detergent, to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
They should not make a noise, which prevents people from sleeping or at work.
It is not just about being a decent man, but that you belong to the people in the truest sense of the proverb, who live in glass houses.
A girl on my floor, their neighbors asked if they had something, Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it is three o 'clock in the morning, and on the morning of a test.
They responded with loud music.
When they finally stopped at 5.00 p.m., they left their neighbours kindly sleep another two hours before they had their own music plÃ¤rren graduated to their door, and came to their three-hour exam.
Would it not be romantic, if your future spouse would coincidentally in the same residence?
Conversely, it would not be deeply embarrassing, if you are a resident of your future Ehepartnerin adhere to them ranmachen, disconnect again and they will have to see every day and, perhaps, see how they are all common friends over?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot resident definitely is not your future Ehepartnerin, you at least try to persuade your abdomen a little common sense.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys in his room, not closed, is the fine line between having fun appealed and bullying than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it takes only moments before it becomes a boomerang.
Give you perverted by hiding a valuable and enjoyable lesson about security - but never someone you room with toothpaste and shampoo.
You shut your door, and you put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but tackern you their possessions on the ceiling of no more than twice.
Row houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have much money.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "not only need Wohnhraum refugees, but also the single mother and the low earners."
"I am showing how you can still build cheap and good," says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees are piling into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Mark Gildner believes to know how rapidly cheaper housing can be built: it builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees are piling into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: the mass housing in containers or gym has no sustainability.
For the people to remain a big part here.
Given the influx of refugees, we will need enough housing in the next couple of decades.
A very banal, three-storey townhouse is the solution.
Gildner: a terraced house requires less space.
It facilitates the integration.
It is different if you accommodate people in apartment buildings.
Each of the six houses that were built in the pilot project, consists of three apartments, each for four asylum-seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, one bath, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say again, there is peace, I will go back.
Then the houses can be easily rearranged to suit the requirements.
What are the costs?
Gildner: the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184000 euros, without a plot.
This is manageable.
Six months of construction has lasted.
This is a good thing.
The building codes have complicated their plans?
Gildner: I was planning my project properly.
Particularly difficult, it always makes the looming sword of Damocles Sonderbau and parking regulations.
Creepy.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates a terraced house of three apartments, needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities is that they have the space.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the locals react to her townhouse project?
Gildner: there were those who have accused me of creating luxury premises for asylum-seekers.
What is definitely not true.
But you do not tighten up the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: but it is true: we had a building boom over the last five years in Germany, but were built luxury homes that can afford a little more.
My project has the message that ordinary people need housing.
Not just refugees, but also the single mother, or the low paid.
I will show how you can still build cheap and good.
That is what it is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied micro system technology in Regensburg and initially environmental analyses.
IOS 9: how do you get the new iPhone operating system, when Apple will update published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap on "general" and then select "software Update."
If it is willing to give you the telephone, the option to download and then install it.
Some have failed after the installation ran into problems, because they receive an error message that tells us that the "software update" is.
In order to circumvent the problem, it is recommended that users either have to wait until the rush back or try to update through iTunes.
The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps in order to create space - but Apple has made it less likely by the streamlining of the updates, and it will be easier to do this, if you use a special tool to delete apps and then install them again, once the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located in the vicinity of a battery charger, so that the battery is loaded.
If the load is too low, Apple is not that the update will continue, possibly because the phone halfway off and this could lead to a breakdown in the update.

Rosbergs only motto: full attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the battle for the championship in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton just a motto: "full attack."
The second stressed before the start of the crucial seven overseas race, that "I have nothing to lose."
53 points separate the vice world champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from title defender and two-times champion Hamilton.
The Briton has won seven of the previous 12 races and adopted the floodlit Grand Prix in the city-state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state at the Grand Prix of Singapore will have influence, it is still unclear.
For days a brown haze over the city, caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger chess club has been a prominent member
Established in the chess club three months ago, "chess players Bad Kissingen" has added another member in its ranks, so the number of members increased to 19 players.
This is a new member of the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who was more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen to cure.
Gauselmann is winner of the Federal Merit Cross, 1 Class and Honorary Citizen of cities Espelkamp and LÃ¼bbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has Gauselmann support with a donation, the Chairman Alfred Klein.
As a result, it is possible to incorporate chess players who can't summon up the membership fee.
Youth and talent should also be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the chess club and friendly contact with the tennis club "rot-Weiss" seen as an expression of its commitment to the city.
Quartier office seeking direct contact
Saludis and Antoni pen Old Centre have come together under the guise of social foundation and the Graf-Stauffenberg-Square opened a new place.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain into the city.
More specifically to the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
It has recently opened a new office quarters.
Here, next to the shopping market, now senior citizens receive and for information on issues such as the care insurance or benefits of the health care and health insurance.
For years, we notice with our outpatient care service that is often the relatives caring for being left alone.
There are an infinite number of questions.
"Also not uncommon for many services, not the banks, because of the complexity of the insurance companies," explained the new house mistress Jutta Weigand, who as a division head elderly assistance for Antoni pen and the civic hospital and is responsible for the outpatient service "Amadeus" is barely understood.
In addition to the meetings, the new office accommodation but also for prevention, health and wellness classes.
The Saludis was taken on board.
Therefore, we can use additional services, such as fall prevention, memory training, or a physical treatment.
The offers from the senior center and the Saludis complement one another ideally.
Saludis stands for prevention, care and rehab.
"The senior center for care and maintenance," Heike Riedel, Executive Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new travel service offices in the city centre, both managing directors especially in demographic change.
This is a decentralized infrastructure in different parts of the city of Bamberg, essential in the future.
In addition, the mayor stressed Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) at the inauguration ceremony, the office will also dedicate the loneliness in old age: "there are many events and special offers on the program and invite them to a regular play pen."
The social foundation to bar a large contribution that seniors can live independently well into their familiar environment.
The office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 to 6.00 p.m. and Saturdays from 10.00 a.m. to 12.00 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg Against Tribal kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: FC Eintracht Bamberg has not yet been established against the still WÃ¼rzburger kickers because of renovation work at the Fox Park stadium, the date for the game, has now set a deadline of 6 October.

Dr. Frank Muller takes practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Mueller-Gongoll and Frank Mueller (left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Happy also velvet municipality mayor Bernd Bormann, business promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs mayor Hein Fried Kabbert.
In many places around the country are short of doctors - Asendorf against lucky: there, Dr. Frank Mueller's practice Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, his successor in the next couple of months with a half-point.
After a phase of MÃ¼ller opened the practice again on 12 October, until then, he invested 310000 euros in the premises at St Marcellus Road 6.
It was sympathetic at first glance, when the Felstehausens years ago Frank Muller and his wife became familiar with Dr. Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongoll, currently their specialist training in Verdener hospital and next year will also be in the practice.
"We have always had in mind that Mueller would fit nicely into this practice," says Dr Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was ready, I have just phoned them."
The couple liked the idea of Muller to run his own practice in Asendorf.
"The closeness and the constant contact with the patient are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Mueller.
"We want to get to know the families over the years."
As an advantage, he can also see, soon to be his own boss.
And it was generally agreed that Mueller bought the house with the practice.
They will, however, continue to live in breakage Vilsen.
The two-time family man Frank Muller grew up, followed by his medical studies in Hanover stations in several doctors ' offices and hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a Head of Department in Sulingen, he also was appointed to the senior emergency physician in the district of Diepholz, 2009 and has been involved as volunteers in the DRC-readiness breakage Vilsen.
As of September 19, the practice is being prepared for the new chief.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a doctor, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specialises in the gastroenterology.
The Mueller, both internists, want to establish themselves as a family doctor.
"It is possible, therefore, to be released," says the 38-year-old Silvia Mueller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound tests and long-term- and stress-EKGs and need one more surgery.
In addition, the computer will be completely renovated.
Get a stipend from a total of 50000 euros, the Mueller in the context of a programme of support from the county (25000 euros), as well as from the velvet municipality (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how happy and proud we are that the practice will continue," said velvet municipality mayor Bernd Bormann.
About 2000 patients, according to Silvia Mueller-Gongoll each quarter in the practice Felstehausen, there are about 500 in the northern German average practice.
There is another house in Asendorf doctor's practice.
One positive side-effect of the practice of takeover by Frank Mueller: the pharmacy remains according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, they would be gone too.
Anyone who visited MÃ¼ller appointments, incidentally, looks to continue, especially in familiar faces: the seven medical staff and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen humorous.
A little bit of sadness they feel after a long period of time.
"But we continue to live in High Moor and many patients will surely see more often," says the Internistin.
Her husband added laughing: "we have a 6000-square-metre plot."
"I've always avoided gardening, now could be different."
The couple also has two grandchildren and loves to travel.
Croatia: " we let the refugees '
"Now the border controls at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
Was it clear that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum, "this could, of course."
The care and safety of the people standing in the foreground.
But it is also clear that "we need clear signals," said the minister.
The people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration, not even on the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It takes a controlled approach.
Croatia, Slovenia is considering "corridor" - denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wants to allow incoming refugees to travel further in the direction of Austria and Germany and possibly create corridors for the refugees.
Just saw this Interior Minister Vesna GyÃ¶rkÃ¶s Znidar in Ljubljana, though.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," Slovenia will intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, however, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister emphasised, Slovenia wants to seal its borders to refugees.
"Every EU member must complete its obligations, otherwise the system would not work," said GyÃ¶rkÃ¶s Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried during the night hours on Tuesday, entering the Eastern border crossing Tovarnik/sid to evade the registration.
The Croatian police could pick up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media ever since meeting in the Croatian Tovarnik constantly police vehicles with new refugees.
It was mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Also, rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
Expect in the coming days, his country, with around 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Moreover, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had hitherto brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, Croatian and Serb told media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, denied that it was to advise the people to take certain routes: "neither we, nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to media reports, at least in the morning a first bus carrying around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, in the course of the day, other coaches would be expected.
On Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 km away from Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed down, so we told the police that we have to come here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
So that it could actually get to the observers already predicted shift in the current Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a stretch a little further to the west.
Croatia: "comprehensive ways to border control"
Croatia's Minister of Interior Ostojic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the case of a large influx of refugees on plans for possible emergency situations.
He mentioned details, but he pointed out that Croatia was a non-Schengen member "comprehensive options for border control."
Consider strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia is one of this since 2007, the EU's partner since the country is consistently a testimonial as to the standard of border controls.
On the Serb side, behind the Hungarian border fence remains around 300 refugees.
According to Belgrade media reports they had spent the previous night at the border Horgos to RÃ¶szke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to continue to travel to the Croatian border, is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to reassure MittwochfrÃ¼h for a look at what is happening in Horgos: he does not think that the debates on alternative routes for refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, is premature.
Currently, it would not be very large numbers of refugees.
They could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Rates of immigrant workers to dangerous - alternative routes -
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees, where alternative routes are drawn in through Croatia.
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia, however, is not dangerous: in parts of the border area, there are also 20 years after the end of the war, Croatia still not cleared minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of minesweepers was sent into the border region.

Mannheim ecumenical hospice assistance for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz there is brisk business.
The people do their errands, sometimes fast, in part, breath comfortably.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim-based Auto Salon at the Parade Ground.
City cars.
Vibrant, plump life in stunning autumn sunshine and in the midst of four large panels with the heading "before I die, I would like to...."
The Ecumenical Hospice made with the help of this action on its 20-year anniversary and is faced with mixed reactions.
"It is about life, so we are left with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," said Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice aid is the same for passers-by questions and discussions are available as the volunteer staff.
While many a passerby spontaneously reverts to the chalk and the phrase "yes, my life," read ","  "ride with the campers from the US,"  "stop the war" or "long suffering" supplements, others remain short, read, say phrases like "as far as I am not yet" and then go further.
Again and again on the verge of developing small discussions about the action itself, about the life, dealing with the death.
Peter HÃ¼binger is also on the ground.
"Only if I am clear that, for me at some point come the end of the world, I can live responsibly," says the director of the diakonisch plant in Mannheim, is the winner of the Ecumenical hospice assistance together with the Caritas Association.
Therefore, this action is effective for the public good, 20-year-olds.
Not everyone wants to say publicly on the boards, but is understandable, after all, it is a very personal thing.
The issue of death and dying is still riddled with taboos, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, albeit just the hospice movement in recent years have contributed to the open man.
An assessment of the Angelika Godefroid shares.
The companion of death and mourning is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the issue through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical hospice assistance per call was looking for volunteers, they have been reported immediately and was at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the patients and family members in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and hospice St Vincent.
They all are carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can cope well with their task and the experience gained and experiences.
"I see life from a different queue, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the Ecumenical outpatient hospice service is free of charge, regardless of confession.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from members and clubs allows for the training and training and supervision of the pet death and mourning.
Every two years will be offered training for new employees.
The panels on Saturday described are now in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the home of the Catholic Church (Â§FÂ§2Â§,Â§ Â§6Â§).

FedEx earnings mixed financial-reduced prospects for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the shipping giant lowered its profit outlook for an entire year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said that it plans to hire roughly 55000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this point last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The shares fell more than 2.5 percent in the Premarket trading 45 minutes prior to the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said, to earn a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 $ for the fiscal year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected, according to a poll by FactSet 10.84 $.
The reduction comes despite the prospect of price increases, which amount to an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages, which are collected from November.
The company said that it expects that earnings over the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenue and because of the growth in online trade will increase.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides "solid returns, given the weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for the holiday jobs were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire between 90000 and 95000 more workers, roughly the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share amounted to 2.42 $ per share, just behind the $2.44 $ per share, the twelve inquired of Zacks Investment Research analysts predicted.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, the turnover in its express delivery unit brought to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue at the ground transportation by 29 percent, but operating income was essentially flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In the Premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell 3.85, or $2.5 percent, to 150.15 $.
On Tuesday, they closed with a loss of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At its most anticipated meeting in years Federal Reserve strategists spent two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it is time to raise the benchmark rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Looming above them at one end of the ornate two-storey sitting room wall is a picture of the United States.
The card is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: to maximise the US employment and keep prices stable.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate of the X-factor could be in a decision that is too narrow to predict them. It will be announced on Thursday that if the US economy is ready to start from the unprecedented stimulus by the underlying short-term interest rates close to zero since the end of 2008 to be weaned.
Although most of the economic data show that it is growing solidly, could make the recent turmoil in global financial markets already cautious Fed representatives anxious to reinforce this volatility by raising the interest rate on government bonds, and it is only about a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will primarily be the most important, what they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do what in themselves the financial market.
About half of the economists who were surveyed recently by Bloomberg, have this week predicted an increase in interest rates.
The financial markets, however, expect a wait of the Fed, with a key indicator, showing only a 30% chance of a hike.
This suggests a decline in the stock market, if the Fed raises rate, except that the strategists softened the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped to 228.89 points, or 1.4%.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy upholds the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be surprising if the Fed would raise rates at this point, " he said.
If they do it, "they would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that a hike would reassure the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.
Yellen had said during the spring and the summer that they would be required this year, despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress, expect an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labor market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the levels that the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And while inflation has been consistently below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed's representative said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
"The economy can sustain higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world begin to twitch at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell in May by more than 16% from its highs, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would curtail global growth.
The market has rebounded slightly this month, with the Dow now at almost 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed representatives influence the market turmoil of the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news would not have emerged over the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would tighten the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
He now predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better handle on the impact.
"There are a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it technically should not be involved in their decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become monetary authority in the world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could tighten its monetary expansion "," triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it can be expected from the Fed representatives that they not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
"Their decision-making is more art than science," said Zachary Kara Bell, head of global strategy for the asset management firm Envestnet, Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noticed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreaction on financial market movements, which are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, is campaigning for an increase in interest rates, cited decisions over the years, as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions, "despite limited visible impact on growth in the US," said Lacker.
A year later the Fed representatives made these cuts.
The Fed should only aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse first, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee on the interest-rate setting Bank of England.
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level, he said.
"They certainly do not want to fall into the situation, in which she has fear of a rate increase, because the markets are excited," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and no mention of financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that they should jump ahead of the time.

Hoyerswerda: small life assistance for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
A warm welcome to you, is not possible without the dedication of countless volunteer helpers.

Brazil's Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS tries to educate women in a shocking way, about how important good nutrition while breastfeeding is. It is doing so with the presentation of pictures of babies who suck on her breasts, which are painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates to give the babies all the nutrients they need in order to build a strong immune system.
Because of the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily caloric intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher intake of calories is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet can have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Exceptions to the new Bernrieder sports hall
The Bernried council approved the Bauantrag for EUR 2.3 million in expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof should be flat for the solar system.
The plans for the long-awaited Turnhallenbau on Bernrieder sports grounds are progressing step by step: in the recent City Council meeting, unanimously approved the draft Bauantrag without much debate.
Previously, the board decided, among other things, a request for a baugesetzliche "exception" or "liberation" from the current construction plan.
The "exception" dealt with the permission of a special form on the roof structure.
According to a "roof with non-modified First and roof survives."
Background of the planning is the proper use of the roof space for solar panels: "we have a wonderful big SÃ¼ddach together," mayor Josef Steinberger said in the meeting.
The "liberation", in turn, went to the roof slope, which - unlike in the construction plan prescribed for energy reasons - is less than 10 degrees.
The volume of the hall is reduced significantly.
A "liberation" was necessary because the construction plan on the roof slope does not allow for "exceptions" - and the Bernrieder council in the more restrictive rules on exemption requests.
In the Turnhallenbau, however, it is not a recurring project: "we do not create a precedent," said Steinberger.
The Turnhallenbau at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Costs are around 2.3 million euros.
Grants are expected to come from the school and grassroots sports funding.
In the next procedural step, the Bauantrag will now be submitted to the local Health Authority for consideration for the Hall 18 x 36 metres wide.
Hospital PeiÃenberg moves to Schongau

The change has caused the cancellation of Dr. Andreas Eder, the first since the beginning of the year Ãrztlicher Director of the Schongauer clinic and is now in private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who should succeed them, according to Jochner-White, the name "fishing" into the game, who agreed to take over the baton from 1 October, and with his team to switch to Schongau.
This means, in any case, an "appreciation" and an expansion of the offer in the field of "internal medicine," says Jochner-and-white for the house in Schongau.

Refugees need accommodation: study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tight.
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable home.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
The social housing sector is facing a challenge.
The fights on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overburdened in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens in the last affordable housing.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, need to be built by 2020, every year, 400000 new units.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Associations Alliance ' social housing '.
For comparison, this year will be held in Germany to 260000 units.
Thus missing 140000 homes.
Refugees are no longer obligated to the first three months of their stay to live in a reception as accommodation for asylum seekers.
Many then come across the housing market and in the long queues at a rental apartment.
The German Federal Statistical Office states, however, lived in the last year, less than half of all asylum-seekers.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only because of the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study also draws significant failures in the housing policy of the last few years.
Germany is pushing a housing deficit, which grows from year to year.
Currently lacking in the conurbations around 770000 units, Matthias GÃ¼nther complained, author of the study.
Many workers lived in big cities are inevitably in WG-rooms.
Young adults were involuntary because of the downturn in the housing market in the longer "hotel Mama."
In the big cities, the number of square metres per head for the first time in recent years has fallen again.
In order to solve the problem, the alliance of "social housing" suggests a fresh start.
With new incentives to boost social housing.
It could be dispensed with the estate tax and the property taxes on a temporary basis for subsidised housing.
Moreover, according to alliance of attractive tax relief are needed.
The support programme for refugee accommodation of state bank KfW plays well in cities and towns already.
A good week after the start was already more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available retrieved on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now, the project could even be increased.
Refugees have safe-conduct: Croatia and Slovenia have a corridor
Hungary is no longer practical to get through, because more and more refugees are choosing the path of Croatia.
Zagreb announced to grant the transit through Slovenia to the north without any hurdles.
The route is dangerous but nonetheless.
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if it is necessary, we will organise a corridor," said the Croatian interior minister Ranko Ostojic.
Situated between Croatia and Slovenia and Austria already belongs to the Schengen zone.
Croatia's EU country is not yet a Schengen country.
Following the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees from Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people have come over the border in Tovarnik, the Croatian television station RTL reported.
Hungary had the previous day sealed off its border to refugees.
New laws that came into force on the same day, moreover, make proper asylum procedures in Hungary almost superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "they can go through, and we are preparing for that possibility."
These people are, because they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up on the morning of the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbour Croatia.
Most were from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan, according to media reports.
They came with both the bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk on the green border with Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees face not on border fences.
The border strip carries other risks: there are still active mines in the Yugoslavian civil war in the 1990s.
Minesweepers are now supposed to quickly create a safe passage.
Come to Hungary, hardly any more refugees, however, after the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, the police picked up 366 people.
Just before close on Monday, there were even 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify the removal and damage to the border fence as a criminal offence.
In the border city in Southern Hungary 35 Szeged criminal proceedings were instituted.
The condemned man in prison sentences up to five years and the expulsion from the country.
According to the immigration authority they had on Tuesday in the newly established along the border "transit zones" received a total of 94 asylum applications, almost all - 93 - the most important transitional RÃ¶szke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning had stopped there, 40 refugees.
However, virtually no one has a chance of getting asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungarian believes Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejected asylum-seekers should be deported.
The "transit zone" at RÃ¶szke gathered only a few hundred refugees.
At RÃ¶szke started to clean up workers.
They collected the trash, the tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks had left by the roadside.
Sperrgitter were removed and one of the camps in the border town has been transformed.
The goal of this tag no one wanted to speak out.
Austria reached only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also reinforced its border controls.
Around 20000 migrants stayed but according to government figures still in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the onward journey to Germany.
The movement of trains from there to Germany was halted in the morning on the orders of German authorities.
In Freilassing regularly met small groups of refugees on foot.
Mayor stranded drove across the border
"We were engaged after the Bridge Festival on Sunday with the clean-up, when suddenly ten people with travel suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," says Wernsteins mayor Alois Stadler.
The tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Because Germany had stopped on Sunday but because of the influx of refugees the rail traffic with Austria, was a surprise for them in Wernstein conclusion, " said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the stranded together with two other volunteers and their cars across the border to ride near Passau.
Previously, we have the unexpected guests, eating with snack and drinks.
We have said we will bring you by car to Passau, Germany.
"This was a matter of course for us," said Stadler at the OÃN-interview.
They were very grateful.
A man was handed over to a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire.
"This has been very happy," says Stadler.
The stranded passengers were on Sunday evening in Wels by an ICE in a train, switching the direction of Passau, to put it in the short term, according to recent pronouncements that the railway traffic was stopped in Germany, but still try to cross the border.
The train was parked but above the border in Wernstein am Inn.
The GrenzÃ¼berschreitende in general is highly rated in Wernstein.
The bridge connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, the day before a two-run athletic bridges - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria in Neukirchen.
Now that Viktor OrbÃ¡n several more thousand sends to us, is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of in the camp RÃ¶szke immediately to assist in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity, our Chancellor has officially and publicly put the attitude of the Hungarian government in the orbit of Nazism.
Victims of this policy are not only those Austrians, who are now faced with chaos in the border areas.
The GeflÃ¼chtete will also have to conclude that the "promised land" that she has invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the continuing flow of refugees and the onset of winter, in decent conditions for asylum seekers.
And it will be even greater - peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35000 permanent winter quarters
Konrad has her hands full with the refugee sunt.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to the fact that his word carries weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen bankers to draw up lists for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the reception centre Traiskirchen Konrad has already mastered.
"We have no more homeless in Traiskirchen," he said of his first success.
Also the accommodation of the 20000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday, was done without a big fuss, said Konrad and praised the organizational "masterpiece."
The Ministry of the Interior, however, spoke of a "crisis situation."
Overall, Konrad has a demand of 85000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the numbers need to be found in the next few weeks, 35000 accommodations - 20000 of which countries should provide the Federal 15000.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it is not a bottomless pit," said Konrad.
He has already held talks with the country of captains.
This would have assured him that even for the next few quarters to create refugees.
In Upper Austria, "it is going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph SchÃ¶nborn, the purpose is to clarify how the church will help.
Great expectations, the coordinator of asylum in the ORF action "help as we are."
On the platform, individuals can offer simple accommodation.
It also hopes for hotels, which stand empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for the accommodation as "very high."
In the face of adversity, it could not be that providers must adhere to a certain amount of the towel rail or the size of the other spatial structures.
For a limited period of time, "Notstandards" would apply.
He was in contrast to the Ministry of Interior in the placement of successful Konrad, justified by his experience.
I am an older man, whom they say not immediately in the face of the untruth.
His main weapon of persuasion is.
Konrad and Maier of the Republic do not cause cost, as they explained themselves.
They want their staff to increase three to four.
Your own lodging search has not yet been successful.
Conrad wanted to set up a container at the St. Stephen's Square as an office.
But there are obviously problems with the permit.
Calls for a better division of Linz

For the emergency but other sites are to be checked for their suitability.

Other districts also must play their part here.

Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not closed off.
The passage of refugees in Germany is still possible.
However, there are now just the appropriate controls.
There will no longer be special trains with refugees to Germany.
The asylum-seekers would be brought, however, with regular trains to Germany.
The other EU member states passed once again called for more solidarity in the refugee issue.
Now that Austria on its border controls reintroduces PÃ¼hringer, "a logical consequence is for" from the actions of the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The major overhaul of the "new" industrial yard line in the Linz is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building is leased to the Stock Exchange listed IT company, S & T, the rest (2700 square meters) to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
"In IT are the wise heads of our raw material - and we have to try that they work for us," says S & T's chief Hannes Lower Hauser.
He could imagine to invest in startup companies in the New Shipyard and later to acquire any.
From the very beginning, S & T intends to cooperate with the new neighbors - a Lower Hauser promises: "the next Runtastic is only a matter of time."

"We are the only ones in the urban area of Linz, which sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has gotten wide from her mother in the cradle.
To me the most is if something develops and I can show you new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women at the sight of a beautiful handbag in the rapture, the expert can't answer.
Perhaps it is because that is a nice bag of every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are pretenders.
This option also connects with some billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for Aufreger.
Whether he is xenophobic, male journalists or gaps in their knowledge of the international crisis policy revealed - the candidate for the US presidency swirled vigorously on the election campaign.
And performs well here.
This will be recorded in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire.
The New York City with the FÃ¶hnfrisur is many in the village of winemakers on the Wine Route.
Some of the 1200 people on the ground - dozens of corners is related to him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in Pfalzen: Donald Trump, here in the campaign mode.
The KallstÃ¤dterin Simone Wendel on Trump.
And what the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
"I think that is the kind of exciting, but also in its Kallstadter kind not so deeply impressed," says Simone Wendel.
The native KallstÃ¤dterin has filmed a humorous documentary about the town and its famous offspring, including next to Trump, the Heinz ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, is in "kings of Kallstadt" (2014), so to speak - by saying that he would also be successful if he would live in Kallstadt.
The king of hearts, he has not brought it there.
While there is respect for the power of the family, but also tend to be of the opinion that Trump is "a bit of a big mouth," said Wendel.
Strangely enough, the noisy nickname, Kallstadt in the vicinity, "the Brulljesmacher" - to high English: the show, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of pretenders.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the grandfather and later opened a restaurant for gold rush in the US.
Foundation stone of the real estate company was the first piece of land purchases in New York.
But the lives of grandparents was not without tragedy: their desire to return permanently to the home failed, the Bavarian state, which then belonged to the Pfalz.
He did not include Trump, because he once was hewn down without permission, the director of the Institute for Palatinate history and folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the movie to start.
He is the grandson of an ' illegal immigrant '.
This is in contrast to the sometimes bombastic statements of the offspring.
Had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall in order to deter illegal immigrants.
"As the noise, it is not so appealing," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant cousin Trump ("Grandma was a born Trump, Grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired vintner sees the Americans rather aloof, "he is always so effervescent."
Does he think that Trump is?
"I can't imagine," says the 72-year-old girl.
"He has never taken care of Kallstadt."
The Pensionswirtin Veronika Schramm mentioned how many Kallstadter, a descendant of the Heinz family during a visit to the church organ donated what was generally a good thing.
"I can't imagine the Donald," says the 68-year-old girl.
You think it would be better if he did not win the election, because "such radical views, I do not know if that is good."
If those who had been at the time of his grandfather in the US calling the shots, as he had, "he would never arrived there."
"There are interesting issues than him," says vintner daughter Sarah BÃ¼hler.
And as a President?
It is not "my president," she says.
And: "the grapes are ripe," without the President Trump.
Wendel Film, was interviewed for the Trump, have long seen 12000 KinogÃ¤nger, even in the US is stirring the interest.

Seven's Sunrise dominated the ratings, despite the attempts by Nine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rushed to Canberra to report following the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it has no major shifts in the ratings for Today.
The breakfast show from Nine was broadcast by the nation's capital, when Malcolm Turnbull made the overthrow of Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Army days, stuck in London as part of a weeklong series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The disadvantage of the distance seemed for Australian TV viewers to play a role, as Sunrise 397000 viewers, on average, scored in the five capital cities, compared to Today 339000.
Today posted a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317000) and last Tuesday (283000), but his numbers fell short of last Thursday (343000).
Today in recent months has closed the gap with Sunrise.
In August, Today averaged 318000 compared to 330000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40000 and 50000.
So far in September, Sunrise averaged 349000 viewers to 314000 in Today.
This is the most interesting what happens every morning.
The winds of change this morning affect more people than the Parliament.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the review.

Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly, apparently, who will win The Bachelor.
The woman, Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally landed, was wrapped in the greatest secrecy.

However, if the question is asked, "if you do not, who should get Wood's final rose?" Their answers could be the spoiler, who won the hearts of the Bachelor's degree.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski cited both quickly - except himself - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been from day one, a simple relationship with each other.
"From the moment when I walked into the house and noticed (Sarah) and Sam energies, because I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is with both feet on the ground, there is so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I have seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel nice and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From their point of view, Mackay said that the home visit last week made it clear that Wood could be "the One."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now fully adjusted to him," she said.
And when she was asked to choose whom to Wood, if they do not, because it was puzzling.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams that fielded questions after his impressive open training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers, and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers have Hayne banished for the rest of the game on the bench, when he lost a battle, as did the Aussie rugby league convert on his first punt-return on Tuesday when a 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula confided to his man and gave Hayne's next opportunity to take a punt return and also in the running game for a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula also revealed his true colors in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula strengthened Hayne also publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his botched catches and to care for the next game.
Jarryd Hayne has dropped a punt that was recovered by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of
It certainly was not the start that the Hayne and his massive entourage Australian had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left after the Fumble go the playing field and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM, that he could imagine no worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that just happens, you only cares about the next game, and that is it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the blunder with his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass resulted in a try for Queensland in his own in-goal area.
However, overall it was a great experience for the 27-year-olds.
Hayne poses for a photo with fans and owns an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.

That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum claims: "we need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.

"Bavaria pushes off, others do not."

4 people were killed after police fire rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal, after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of people who marched against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence erupted on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital, Katmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district officer, said that more than 1000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police had used tear gas and fired into the air before they returned to rubber bullets.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber bullets, which are known, that they can kill, but they are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The confrontation was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the ethnic group of the Madhesi say that new provinces that are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution that would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since 10.
Killed in August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution, but it is a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has for centuries been governed centrally.
The work on a new constitution is on the road since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April, thousands of people have been killed.
The lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said that the new Constitution could come into force on Sunday.

Emden - The town of Emden intends to commercialize a 4000 square metre plot of land in the immediate vicinity of the youth centre Alte Post.
The preparations are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of commercial, industrial and housing.
You wait for the appropriate offers, it is on the part of the city.
What investors will come, is not yet clear.
Also according to whether or not treaties have been signed.
The city of Emden was a part of the plot, which is located on the Ringstrasse/corner of Grand Street, a few months ago and bought the building to be demolished.
Project Hieve: details are on the table
The plans for the holiday house at the Little Mermaid in Emden take shape.
The investor told publicly for the first time plans for the project.
Many residents are worried - they continue to fear the sell-off of their recreational retreat
For months, was negotiated behind closed doors and pondered and debated.
There are now plans for a new vacation house at the Little Sea near Emden, on the table.
The visitor, the medium-sized Emder enterprise "system-building," said on Monday night in the city development committee of the Emder Council his plans publicly for the first time.
This item originally had been in the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from critics of the project and the FDP group who accuse the investors and the management of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the system's construction management team on the offensive: "we do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumours now.
The expensive project around 10 to 12 million euros in the discussion for months.
Strong reactions among sea fairground owners, who had come into the meeting, called the images and new details emerged about the desired Hotelbau.
Roberto Schulz, seaside stalls owner and board member at the representation of the interests of riparian, Pro Hieve, complains: "this will be a giant monster, dominated all the other building."
Moreover, he fears, as many other critics of the project, that the traffic would increase sharply by the intended size of the plant: "as a whole Busladung come to, so it makes sense," says Schulz
What exactly happens in the good one-acre grounds of the former pub, however, is still open.
Still, there is no operator.
"We need to have a consistent approach," said Ralf Behrends.
Because of this, the plans are also variable.

Google launches Verdoppelungs-donation campaign to earn $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a Verdoppelungs-fundraising campaign, which raised $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations, because they are fleeing from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donation appeal on his blog.
Rather than let a manager make the announcement, " wrote Rita Masoud, a Google employee, who has fled with her family from Kabul, when she was seven years old, about their personal experiences.
"Our trip included many dark rail and bus routes, as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family desperately for help.
The donations will go to four nonprofit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million at google.com/Refugee Relief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has sold more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in the weight-loss surgery, who wrote an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss-surgery or obesity-surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity-surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has proved effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is regarded as normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
Used for the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital data they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare the two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric sleeve education - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who undergo this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
In the meantime, the BMI is among those who received non-surgical treatments for diabetes, roughly the same at 29.
Among those who have undergone surgery, broke free at 36% of the diabetes disease completely and at 28%.
Sparked in the medically treated group compared to the diabetes fully only at 1% and sometimes at only about two percent.
In addition, the results were at the controls of the blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol, "are generally better in the ' surgical ' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patients ' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept under 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average decreased hemoglobin A1c levels of around 9 per cent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But these "better glycemic control" - like you - reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels reduced the mortality rate in five years, then the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, had the bypass surgery group compared to the gastrectomy group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and more experienced a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study of surgery, no survival advantage after five years shows that there is hard evidence from a study of people in Sweden, that operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was in obese people who undergo obesity surgery, about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study does not advantage for survival in the surgery patients showed, said Blackstone, it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take seriously the weight as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think that we have to wait long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes, which have their bodies connected with obesity and diabetes, is really hard to reverse. "

"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not accommodate all the refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom, in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to ethics studies.
He claimed that under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be brought before the interests of the individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, but not appropriate to the situation.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria praised efforts in resolving the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Caring for several thousand refugees, is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long-term solutions, like a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he said.
Ultimately, we must consider how to reduce the killing in their own countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke of the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attacks of September 11 and found out that the violent reaction of the US after a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know that his motives were good, but he was a force, and this has given rise to unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold rise in use of hand disinfectant by children in last 4 years
Poison control centers in the US, reporting on a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12, swallowing heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases rose from revenues of hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12, the poison control centers report of 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them end up in the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectant, while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a trial in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young disinfectants drink only because of a cheap experience.
Young people are supposedly disinfectants mixed with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a hard drink.
Younger children can be lured by attractive smells of disinfectant.
"A child does not think that this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are the ones who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scents, which are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol.
Particularly in infants can cause a few splashes of alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison emergency center at the hospital of the University of Kansas, the broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you would not drink whisky, but these people hand disinfectant within reach of children, and if children come out, then it is a quick way to much alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently captured four splashes of strawberry scented hand disinfectants in the school, was brought into an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold, at least one adult is considered legally drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated them in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah lallen, their words and was not able to go when they arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them over night in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, because the girl was killed by alcohol and had met with the head, said Ritchey.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, CNN.
It could have been lethal for my child to be.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfecting wipes and hand disinfectants lie beyond the reach of the child.
About alcohol poisoning, a number of disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women died, women in Ontario after the swallowing of the hands of disinfectants, which contained a toxic ingredient not declared.
Employees of health authorities suspect that the product contains methanol, a lethal solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which has been listed as an ingredient.
In January, three students plan the fourth grade in the state of New York to poison their " nasty " teacher, by interpreting anti-bacterial products around the classroom, " so it is possible for a police report.
The teacher was highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished from their room.
The police saw the thwarted plan as "chatter" and disciplinary action to the school authority.

Why I am going to be witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is brought to death.
If it happens, and I hope that it does not happen, I will sit in a spectator's gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses for his death.
The invitation was made in January for the first time about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed to.
As the day approached, I began to worry me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected, it will be the unemotional.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossips closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we are talking about.
The prison authorities say that, I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to carry a notebook and a pencil to record what I see.
I simply must try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
You tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants, and you get access to it.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "would have put it better," but she still thinks that it is wrong, what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I have said and written.
He tells me not to write what I did, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.
I told him that he can remove me from their list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants to write that one international reporter was present.
When he dies, he thinks that the public will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bell, a reporter of the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts, which I have made.
I do not want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the crime.
But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I feel sure that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I can't really claim to be objective.
There will be other reporters who can write.
What you will get from me, is what it is like to see a man die a needless death.
Man after a wet police-chase, persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he talked to the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth, to depend on the police, was unsuccessful, as he stood in the shallow and swampy water, just a few metres away from a police officer who tried to "gently to persuade him to return to the shore."
The police in Canning Vale on Tuesday was called to a break-in incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspects, this attempted to escape from them towards the Canning River.
But he did not go too far.
"He stood in the water and said ' I do not come out, come and get me," said Senior Sgt. Shan Dell Castle Dine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too thrilled to make his uniform wet, so he turned to a more reliable tactics - "a good policeman."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said senior sergeant Castle Dine.
Championship football player Ben cousins offers an unforgettable example.

Peter Moody claimed that Steward tried to spy on him and threatened to quit the sport
Peter Moody claimed that Steward of Racing Victoria have tried last year to install a spy in his stables and threatened to quit the race immediately.
It was aimed at the Steward and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai due to a race day-treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what is best for the sport and he found himself in difficult conditions, when it came to the positive cobalt-swab sample in Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had 18 months ago because of the spying allegations and did not want it "look like high-hanging grapes."
"I had nothing to say about this, and I have long been sitting on it, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know that it went further.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
This evening, I will go home and sleep well.
I want to walk around with your head, and I would like to see my owners think that I try my best for them.
If they start to think, I am not doing that, then I should no longer be coach.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had the bomb in an interview with state-racing.com, that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey sat, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart - in a room with a man - whom I shall name when I am asked and offered him a job in my stables for information about what I am doing in my stables to deliver," said Moody on Racing.com.
They seem to believe that I am a cheater.
If that is the case, they should certainly look at their noses because they have failed in an attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware at the time and there are still today.
Should get me to believe that it will be personally?
The RVL has behaved cowardly and maybe makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
I feel so bad for the industry?
Perhaps the people out there think that I am there.
Perhaps they need to take my license and me, and I have no doubt that what I say, you can now think about it.
But I am now at a point where I do not care, and that makes me sad.
This makes me really sad.
I will put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The Frustrations-levels of coaches have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation in Lidari, and the late scratching meant that he said that he could "throw his license on the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation for the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, described the race day-treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horses legs, which contravened the rules.
" It is against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for this, " he said.
" One of my employees has mistakenly sprayed slurry on the leg.
It could have been yesterday evening.
It could have been all day yesterday, so what was the case.
It was also on the day of the race.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on the day of the race, an investigation of this matter was opened.
It is a joke.
People who set these rules, know nothing about the horse.
"We all recognize that we need rules, but here, it is gone too far," said Moody.

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is fighting back against rivals due to claims of fighting ring
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticism of the tackles of his players as "agenda setting" of two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referee the Storm players "wrestling" with his team during the high storm-victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled comment on the Storm team after his team's final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, he had called the game a "textbook example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "good" in the rings.
Bellamy's Tacklimg defended his team and said that they were the only tackles on their "contact us".
Bellamy added that the criticism from two leading trainers at his team confident agree with him, because it meant that they were concerned to be smitten by the Storm Team.
"It always reappears - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling matches, when they have beaten us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that in the whole year, we have nothing in our defensive system or techniques, but we have changed our contact with Tackles a real focal point in the last six weeks, and it has done for us, the trend.
Trent is there now for three years, and he obviously has a great team to work out, so he is probably not accustomed to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is funny how it always reappears at this time of year.
Bellamy has Bennett's idea of the "exciting football" and attacked his mentor, recalling that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how her game was exciting, " said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he would take care of a shit about shit.
But he now has a team that can play and what we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That is the ball game that you play, if you want that type of player.
He made that statement in 2010, now that he wants all of his type of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.
I am counting on greater trust, because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago they would not have thought of us when it came to the Big Game.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm game against Roosters achieved a higher result than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was a good game, I have not yet seen it, but what was the outcome? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two other attempts in our game, but this is an exciting game?
Or are making breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it is the game plan.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them in a single phase.
The Storm team won this weekend, as they have the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys and the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening in the Vorfinale at AAMI Park, the ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning.
Serbians with a $200000 bail after drug charge

He has clear ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, " he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he had lied to police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovics mother and stepfather had jointly offered a deposit of $200000 as a security in order to achieve his release.
"After reading the statutory declaration statements of the two people, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200000 a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.

He was included in the register of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.

JVA Berlin-Tegel: five-square-metre cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex-prisoner of Justice Correctional Institution Tegel, which was right for months, in a small cell.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to monetary compensation if they are housed in small cells.
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in a decision released on Wednesday.
According to the magistrates, the people affected can even hope to have money if they were just a few days locked up in the tight spaces (Case 1 BvR 1054/01).
It was an ex-prisoner successfully with its constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in the Justice Correctional Institution in Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a solitary cell with roughly five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not closed off.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer now been released, had been moved to a larger cell.
Although his term failed lawsuit liability because of the substandard conditions of detention against the city of Berlin.
But the constitutional judges waived the judgment of the court in Berlin and had the case back for reconsideration.
They see the human dignity of the man.
The supreme court will now decide on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, from the period in question, only a few days in prison days are crucial for the compensation, whether a compensation claim, it said.
Otherwise it would be "a decline in the legal protection of personality."
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the compensation money.
The constitutional courts in the past have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
They spoke only in April a detainee compensation because he was locked naked in a cell.
Human habitation is the multiple-occupancy of a cell without a toilet, according to a decision by 2011.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday, the Constitutional Court of Berlin, which was certified in November 2009 a subhuman housing a prisoner in a parallel case.
Then the plaintiff was more than three months between 15 to 21 hours a day in a row, as in the case of Karlsruhe.
The Berlin prisons were also in the last couple of weeks in the headlines because of a lack of staff.
That is why prisoners are repeatedly trapped 23 hours, the aggression is rising, even unto blows it should be because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office 21 posts are vacant in Tegel Airport due to lack of talent, 19 out of 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "we are creating the"
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What will come to Germany?
Around 800000 asylum-seekers are coming to predictions of the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year after Germany, according to the Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) in Germany is even capable of absorbing a million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has shown determination in light of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do that, and we do it."
What is coming to Germany, gives the following overview.
Needed for different forecasts of between 350000 (estimate of the Bundesbauministerien) and 400000 (estimate of Pestel Institut) homes a year - and the next five years.
That is almost twice as much as previously built homes (250000).
Dramatically, is the lack of housing but especially for affordable rental properties fall: 60000-80000 social housing out of the rental price fixing, and these attractive apartments are also applying for refugees.
Bundesbauministerin Barbara Hendricks (SPD), therefore, wants to double the promotion of currently 518 million to one billion euros.
Is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80000 social housing per year and would have to invest for the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists are in agreement and Bundesbauministerin that there should also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, is the assumption that 55% of the GeflÃ¼chtete in Germany can be employed in the long run.
However, the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications, in order to help them at the start, criticized Claudia Walters, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
The integration of refugees is crucial, but whether they can find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation of the host society, but also for the self-esteem of the immigrant population migration, says researcher Dietrich ThrÃ¤nhardt.
In Germany, there has been a political turning point, according to ThrÃ¤nhardt: the ban on employment for refugees for the recognition of the work.
While there has been a work ban on asylum seekers for up to five years earlier, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the duty of residence, the asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society - is also due to the shortage of skilled workers - the majority view that refugees should be allowed the faster access to the labour market.
A big hurdle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is not yet a sufficient number of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that most jobs through personal contacts.
The construction of networks therefore believes is the royal road to work integrating ThrÃ¤nhardt.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents send their children to the Kita, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "for the displaced parents, it is very important to keep the family together," said Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
Nevertheless, the family of the benefits of Kita, to convince the administration distributed hand slips into different languages.
Should greatly increase the demand for teachers by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing multiple schools.
In the countries students are prepared for the classroom without knowledge of German in welcome.
But they are not always informed by fully qualified teachers, but, as in Berlin, also of teachers who only have a qualification in English as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from Berlin's school of administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no state prohibits asylum seekers or Geduldete study - the only exception has been Berlin Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU), but now has abandoned its position.
Studierwillige!Studierwilligen refugees could facilitate the access to higher education.
For refugees with a residence or outsourcing, no tolerance for the asylum seekers more power when they begin their studies.
The latter have basically no BafÃ¶g, because they do not fall within the circle of bafÃ¶gberechtigten people.
Tolerated refugees have so far lived in Germany for four years, in order to be entitled BafÃ¶g, from 1 January 2016 to shorten this period to 15 months.
But this funding gap must be closed, Steffen call noise, Berlin's state secretary for science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
The students should be given immediate BafÃ¶g.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many of the refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should Islam gradually give the same rights as you have the churches, and the existing state-church law to a new state-religion relationship develop.
Also important would be the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association, a professional to take care of the newcomers.
The rights include duties.
The representatives of Islam must agree on a clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas and give him some control.
It also includes the willingness to act boldly against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Ayman Mazyek, said on Thursday the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to fight such conflicts in Germany have "forfeited their right to live in Germany," he said at the Bayerische Rundfunk.
He suggested that the Basic Law to be translated into Arabic.
Integration in the future will be much more so than today, to be an issue for society as a whole.
It will also have to change the majority society, more pressing, the elimination of discrimination and racism.
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - less than a decade since an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law.
But it very slowly learns how the NSU-murder series showed that the police and authorities have systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: what immigrant organizations and interest groups do not need white Germans have been demanding and what international agreements such as the anti-racism convention Germany commit to remain peacefully in the next few years if the country and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
Germany in general is able to supply the refugees so far expected medical doctors, says President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As regards Man- power and capacity, we create," he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, this extra money needs to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery, calls for all comers in health registration cards.
Services rendered could later be charged with the federal states.
And in the long term it is highly questionable, so many people being fobbed off with limited capacity, the catalogue of the asylum seekers ' performance.
Otherwise, make the doctors above all to create the language barriers.
Until now, Berlin has shown health scientist Thea board, migrants are less informed about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, in doctors ' offices interpreting costs would have to be accepted, calls for it.
Would have helped many refugees but also with more general medical correspondents in the emergency room.
And with another diagnostic.
For example, among refugee children there are considerably more unprocessed disability, and the young people it is about HIV awareness.
With the other partial symptoms German doctors came forth from their training but clear, says Montgomery.
"Parasites or tuberculosis infections are not so difficult to see." And as for the shortage of doctors, perhaps even by the refugees, relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.
In order to be permitted, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany, according to estimates by the German psycho therapists chamber (BPtK) insane: most are suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, said Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study by the University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child trauma arrives in Germany.
Anyone who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder is unwell, among other things, on so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitation, and fears of death.
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration, strong Schreckhaftigkeit and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms of chronic, early treatment is necessary, said Munz.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees a psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum-seekers in the social services make an application for psychotherapy, but the treatment usually lasts several months.
In addition to the social services usually clerk or doctors who are not trained for mental illness, decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new staging of "passion" of the Circus, Dean draws on the traditions of the circus arts.
The goal is to attract people of all ages in the thrall of amazing acrobatics, Tierdressur and unparalleled entertainment.
Now the circus invites Dean in the riding school on the tile-HansÃ¡g dreaming.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Dean, animal teacher and junior officer.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current staging manege.
For more than 33 years, the Circus is in the hands of the family of Dean.
The gift to the Begeistern family is therefore in the blood.
"It is important to us, the people of their daily routine and herded them along for two hours in a completely different world," said the 27-year-old junior officer.
"Cocktail rings with world city flavor," says Director Reinhard Dean calls his concept.
50 cities on the tour almost 3000 kilometres can now experience this atmosphere.
The programme of circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
At the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo brothers know how to do their job.
With the hero of silent films it wants to include the Cuban duo.
Lightness and agility - with these words, they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast to conquer the hearts of women.
Apart from many Lachsalve fascinates the acrobatics of the Circus Dean with sensitivity and suppleness.
With the unicycle balancing on a ball?
For He Yuan is not a problem.
Snakes fascinate and frighten people.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like little else and fascinates with its agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way.
"The animals belong to our family," said Stephanie mother, Brigitte, Dean.
Shortcomings in the behaviour of circus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Dean also takes this stance: "it is not good for our animals, it is also not good."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy stroking each.
"The four-legged artists," as they are affectionately known, will be able to read all of the wishes of the eyes.
We want to work with the animals with them and have fun.
The animal does not feel comfortable, it is not even in the riding school.
The First Commandment is: good for the animals.
Specifically on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPony stallion and a zebra filly, the Dean family is proud of.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a corral and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Dean.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the riding school, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus for Dean.
For each visitor, so something is likely to be involved.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Dean: "no matter whether five or 1200 spectators, we always do our best and are here with all my heart."
The Circus invites Dean from 17 to 20 September at 5.00 p.m. and 8.00 p.m. every day to his ideas.
On Sunday, the program will begin at 11.00 a.m. and 4.00 p.m.
Thursday is the day, the prices are reduced for the presentation at 5: 00 pm.
Moreover, every day the cattle show open from 10.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds the wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell at the beginning of the year by a panel down the stairs.
He was uninjured, but the video of the event spread quickly on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by allegations of the opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and they were warned to accompany the speech by Mr. Mugabe with booing.
Last month they had booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Nation speech in parliament - this is the speech he reiterated on Tuesday.
The spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) - innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians receive SMS messages on their mobile phones, which have warned them not to interfere with Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number that is not shown, but it has the title of ' death '," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the concerned parliamentary members that the immunity ends in Parliament, and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman, said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the risks to the politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25000 to 30000 jobs as part of the restructuring and conservation efforts in the service of the company.
HP will later this year split into two publicly traded companies and away from the computer and printer business from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will lead to a load of more than $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"This restructuring will allow for a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today, and we have to support a broad and extended portfolio of stores, the company's transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual sales and "will be focused on providing unparalleled, integrated technology solutions for businesses," according to a statement from the company.
It is a company that was founded by the graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930's, in order to produce electrical systems and their Palo Alto garage they called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the belief that narrowly focused companies have a better performance.
Arsenal's captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb must stand behind the injured Jack Wils here
Wenger stressed to Brentwood here that it was not until September, and if his rehabilitation goes smoothly, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Brentwood here surely will miss at least the next four games for England, and given his history, his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is still uncertain.
The great shame in this current problem is that here the Brentwood last season had ended badly after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the early season.
"This type of injury is not career threatening," said Wenger.
It is a bone that does not heal well.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his ankle, or with the injury he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but, as Wenger acknowledged, there is also the associated risk of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It has also developed a nasty pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different pathologies of Brentwood here since his debut six years ago.
He played in only 65 games for arsenal 157 league over the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six of the eight seasons since 2007/08, which most violation days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you must strengthen your body and fight to win," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body is stabilized, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
HÃ©ctor BellerÃ­n and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs, Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I am trying to keep the balance and the players who need a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites to progress from Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the most intimidating effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games, after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium on Tuesday evening was shattered by an earthquake, measured on the Richter scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal's lesson has been learned from the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European cup triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never worked for Arsenal.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I am long enough in the business, to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not a dreamer.
Festive friends: the comedy show, which gave us a serious lesson about male friendship
The absence of similar images in the show is obvious, particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up, has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men demonstrate on a 15-year high.
It was the main cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK in 2013, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, announced the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a pitiful life) in 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of the culture in question, which prevents men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the battle, in order to meet this challenge.
A recent study on more than 2000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the sufferer a high percentage had plenty of friends with "healthy" mood, his chances of recovery are doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risk of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends, a friendship can work.
In the age of communication through social media, with its focus on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives, the need to appear strong, vital and successful, doubled, even though in reality the isolation.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, reputation, social status, all at the expense of the intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship, which has an impact on our mental health, much deeper.
And, like a video game creator and billionaire recently declared that money really cannot buy happiness.
The nice thing with Friends was that this focus has been turned on its head.
Each character has been defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent hugs, moments when watching football in comfortable armchairs and the nostalgia of Ross after Rachel - all of this came from the knowledge that men can relate to in any case, even if they are holding back, often to fully explore their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me:... "my listeners role for people who feel depressed and even murder are endangered, has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us, often do not feel able to speak with friends.
The old adage "I get on with it ' has a huge impact, as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness, if one speaks openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows, which comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendship.
So much to help my objective outsider status on the phone to people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friends festival with the celebration of the day completely redesigned scenery, then why are you not your friends for a drink with in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you are sitting in Starbucks alone someone around, you give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the whole - 236 episodes of Friends festival
Is Di Maria to PSG help to crush MalmÃ¶
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his strike against MalmÃ¶.
Di Maria is making its debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helped PSG to pull over to MalmÃ¶.
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept track, as Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player, who brought the French champions on the road, but then they missed a number of occasions, before they finally increased their lead when Cavani in the 61 minute, a Kopfballtor scored.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk, also in the group A Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, since they are not the only qualification for the knock-out rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate, and he was later in the game against his hometown team and the club, with whom he began his illustrious career back in 1999, replaced.
"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it is a good start to win 2-0, our opponents look to cause problems and relaxed, even if there are certain things that we have perfected over the course of the season," said Blanc.
" This is a good omen.
We wanted to win and we have won, although I regret that we do not have another one or two more goals. "
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team, which could hold over the weekend, a 2: 2 draw on home ground against Bordeaux in the first league, but he was hammered by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing striker has been described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe, when it was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he suggested that why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis pass behind the MalmÃ¶-defense before he graduated to Johan Wiland over nicely in the long corner of the net.
However, if someone believed that PSG would be a great victory, was disappointed.
MalmÃ¶, the Celtic in a play-off, in order to reach that stage, appeared in Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was strung with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle of a difficult opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, of the far post to Kevin Trapp went over in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG himself sometimes, with some bad passes and bad accounts, not least from Ibrahimovic, who has dropped in no less than five attempts in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved a lot more skill, when he brought his players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, Di Maria has turned into a revolving pistol, which was drawn by Wiland in the 52 minute at the post over...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayer scored his sixth Saisontor after Ibrahimovic had a left-hand flank of Maxwell especially galling.
It ended all thoughts that MalmÃ¶ could come back into the game, and only a superb intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz, the final result was unable to hold down before replacement players Ezequiel Lavezzi was removed from a gate at the end.
The coach of MalmÃ¶, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: " our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying rounds are not enough. "
Hats off to Paris!!!
It was a great game by them!!!

World and European champion Xavi plays for Al-Sadd Sports Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015
The FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago, shortly before the commitment of the Spanish superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona.
Eight-time Spanish champion, three-time Cup winner, four-times Champions League winner, two-time club world champions, European champions two times, once a world champion title - the list of Xavi is staggering.
In summer, the now 35-year-old girl left after 24 years of FC Barcelona and moved to the Al-Sadd Sports Club after Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca Xavi now tells us that he was standing in front of the departure from Barcelona before Euro 2008.
"They told me that BarÃ§a wants to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, then we have nothing," he recounts.
And it also registered the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "there has been an offer from Bavaria."
"Rumenigge wanted me."
As a reminder, in the summer of 2008, JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann, the Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that not switched Xavi
But the change has not occurred.
And the key man for now works for the German record champions: pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "BarÃ§a Guardiola has under contract and I have played a great EM."
"Pep has told me that I would not change that, he could imagine the team without me."
"He has got to me."
Who knows how Bavaria season 2008/2009 with Xavi would be over.
Xavi was for Barca in the quarterfinals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the turf, the switch from Red (4: 0 1: 1) and celebrated at the end of the King class triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity in film downloads
Matt Damon challenged the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said that she would not be needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of Sunday Night of HBO's Project Green Light, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when this emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonists in the chosen script of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, then you do it during the occupation of the film and not with the cast of the show," Damon.
Brown reacted with shocked disbelief insulted and called "hoo! Wow, okay," as the comments of the actor from The Martian has strengthened.
Damon and Brown joined the producers colleague Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would like to invite people to think about - whoever the director will be - how they treat the figure of Harmony," Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a hooker who is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People campaigned for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing-rights to the film, Damon replied that their director "at the end could give us something we do not want to."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded in disapproval at Damons comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip, he wrote, "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain its diversity - it is SO know that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5000 Retweets and 4000 Likes since its publication.
Damons comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the movement reached Black Lives Matter across the country and urged legislators and government agencies to stop discriminatory practices against black people.
In February the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
He said "album still matter," albums (still have their meaning).
Like books and black lives, albums still have their importance.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The network of Black Lives Matter is a love," the group leader said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of performers, producers and media moguls, who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope, is unclear.

Caldiero spoke with E! News after a hard-fought victory, still reeling from the shock of winning the Grand Prize of $1 million.
"I think it is amazing to think about it, I have never earned more than $10000, or had to live," said Isaac E! About his piles of money.
All of a sudden.. I still can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The executive producer Kent weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, even though he was the first ever ended the sequence that does not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there are more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," weed said.
How much money is a wonderful prize and life changes, he gets great gratification.
I do not believe that he harbors any resentment about that.
He is just so happy to have done what he has done.
Mass of awards he has received from fans.
He is a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "if I had to be beaten by someone, then I am glad that it is Isaac."
And I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had swapped roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for another season, eight of the filming will begin in the spring of 2016.

In the presence of City president Ignazio Marino was baptized in the name of the German reformer on Wednesday, a previously anonymous place in the park on the Oppio Hill.

Hammer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus was painted with the (gold-plated crown of thorns) is one of the main works, Otmar Alt for his Bible.
Klaus Alte Post has written the introduction of updated and Biblical texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which is now with splendid images.
In the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt, who has formulated 150 motives of his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with bright colors and fanciful shapes of the 75-year-old has won - but what is not synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary, adapted to the specific issues that may seem pretty bleak.
About three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible-project, for which he has made a subjective artistic choice from the many issues of the "book of all the books."
Cycles are created that address issues such as crossroads, plagues, bids, or the Our Father.
He is fascinated by spontaneously several partners: this applies to the Lutheran publishing house with its theological orientation, as well as for the Kettler publishing house, with its emphasis on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Alte Post, who has dealt with the Bible on the basis of the painting.
He has interpreted the Bible by Otmar Alt-selected and so to the present day, "translated into current correlations."
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old paintings.
They are embedded between the original bible quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist, here expressed his own personal thoughts on the particular situation.
The jewelry has golden cover letters.
This allows the 75-year-old girl twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately led to the Bible Project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode, born and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"As the education ever happened with the cane," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to cope with this, to me, perhaps with the Lord," father.
His second concern was to restore art in fast-paced time to give more importance: " the perception of visual worlds today is influenced by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and bliss to show things.
Pictures have always been somewhat mysterious, and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to the images of "fall", they seem to be discovered, and what power they have: "the picture is looking for his counterpart."
Klaus Alte Post admitted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Foundation, "has always been" to be a lover of Otmar Alt art: "I like how he lives with his pictures."
It did not look old, the Bible to fully comprehend, but for the important issues, even mysterious.
"This was not a collaboration on a level playing field," says Alte Post: "this is about the images, the text only." Was a picture-Bible.
For Hans MÃ¶hler of Luther's publishing this work is to find an invitation to deepen "his life and freedom."
Otmar Alt pictures speak for MÃ¶hler, both the (biblical) language of love and responsibility.
Some of the originals - paper and canvas paintings for the first time - will be presented in an exhibition that will open on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt-Foundation.

DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB is extending its commitment to refugees from until 2019, the Bundesliga at the weekend, a clear sign.
The football is responding to the deteriorating situation in Germany and secures the policy to its aid in dealing with the problems.
"I consider this to be the greatest challenge of our country since reunification."
"In principle, since no one can say that there is nothing on me, I have nothing to do with it."
"Every individual must be interested in this issue," said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on September 23, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
"I am next Wednesday at the Chancellery and meet the Minister, Mrs ÃzoÄuz and the Chancellor."
"The issue is bound to play a central role," he announced.
The football can and wants to help.
But the decisive influence must be the policy.
The German Football Federation has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1: 0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Over the Egidius-Brown Foundation, we have ensured that this program runs until 2019," said Niersbach on the fringes of the UEFA meeting in St Julian's/Malta.

"The refugee drama goes to everyone, no one should" look.
"We can for football, no, we must use our power, our influence and our ability to help the many refugees who have been so incredible, have suffered," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.

Niersbach described the support as "a large group of refugees of German football."
All 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their villages, is great.
Equally great is that, as small and tiny clubs are active.
"The message" 1: 0 for a welcome, which we have spent, lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and next year, the association is working with the DFB selection and the federal government each 300000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have taken up the whole sum for 2015 already," said Niersbach.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in the accident
The head of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has lost the left eye, according to several reports, by a crash at the beginning of July.
In the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the US, he had died after midnight on a water glass, which he had worn in the left hand, the "Wirtschaftswoche" reporting on Wednesday.
"He is bleeding to death, was almost powerless, then dragged out into the street - that he has told us so, last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could look into his work.
"At the beginning of October, we gather in front of the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager and was "fully operational" at the meeting.
McDermott announced in an interview with the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung (Thursday edition) that he will come back to Germany in October and continue with the software company.
"I am totally there for SAP, in my job."
"Of course, the whole time I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner," McDermott said the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung".
McDermott typically fluctuates between Germany and the US, but since the summer, he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important to him, to go with such a personal story to the public, said the manager of the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung": "any such a thing can happen."
"It is important to stand up again, if you fall off."

Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
With Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group match of the Europa League final.
The players will also be missing in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7.00 p.m./Sky), the league leader of the Football League.
"Unfortunately we were not able to rely on him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus on Sunday in the Bundesliga's top match against Leverkusen will again be the BVB coach: "we expect a return by him to the training on Friday."
Given the high burden of its professionals, Tuchel will change its Stammelf not only at the Reus-position.
He announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular keeper Roman BÃ¼rki.
"He trained at a top level," praised the football teacher, the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller in future in all Europa League games, Tuchel remained unclear, however.
He is likely to contest the second round.
The bold statement made by players Reus, that the final collection for the BVB in the Europa League should be the goal, midfielder Julian Weigl for comprehensible: "Marco is not so wrong."
"I think that we have a good chance of the title as well."
Robot cars: government wants to lead the way for Germany
Germany is supposed to be following the will of the federal government to change the car a technological pioneer.
The German cabinet on Wednesday decided a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which, among other things, provides for investment in digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the fringes of the IAA auto show of a "new era of mobility."
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less congestion, said Dobrindt.
He wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, including at the IAA, along with representatives of the industry.
The strategy document of the Transport Ministry, among others, stresses the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
The new technique is currently testing a test track on the Highway 9 in Bavaria.
So the driver will be saddled with "no additional liability risks," the federal government wants to review the legal framework "and, where necessary, to adapt to the new developments."
Thus, Germany, for example, international efforts to ensure that the speed limit is raised for self-driving cars from 10% to 130 miles per hour.
The federal government also wants to push for a revision of the Vienna Convention, which so far includes only the people as a driver.
The automated driving leadership is increasingly the car, the driver is turning more and more to the passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras, which record the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on highways by 2020 will be technically possible.
Nevertheless, be driverless vehicles on public roads "until well after 2020."
The added value in terms of driver assistance systems and the high value of automated equipment in Germany, the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion.
"The digital network of cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency on the road," said the SPD politician Transport SÃ¶ren Bartol.
The question of liability in case of an accident and the safety of the personal data of the driver but clearly needs to be clarified.
Even the Germans, however, see self-driving cars - much more skeptically than French or American.
A survey presented on Wednesday at the AA by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be travelling in the next ten years, 32 percent expect in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe this.
In France, 21% of respondents expect to 2025 with autonomous driving cars, 33% in the US.
In any case, the car drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey of the association Bitkom Digital would agree to only seven percent of the control over the entire ride on all roads.
On the motorway could imagine the traffic flowing as much as 15 percent, 45 percent in the closet.
Well one in four people would be left to the car's control under any circumstances.

Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a combination of a major fashion show and a Jubilee-shop of horrors: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) has presented an exhibition of his work on Wednesday in Munich.
Highlights: the mannequins, with video projections look frighteningly human.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, among others, with Madonna's stage Nout fits the big star of the fashion scene - and thus that he put men in skirts.
"Today I can't say that I am the enfant terrible of haute couture, because I have white hair."
"It used to be white, but in the meantime it is genuine," said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "from The Side Walk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), which has changed from 18 September at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion designers of his initial opposition to an actor about his person.
In fact he was against it, because: "for me a exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When one dies, you will come to the museum.
The impressive collection was made previously in Montreal, Canada, and in Paris.
"It is about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the varied range of works of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training program.
Chronologically, the exhibition has not been built, but it is a brilliantly choreographed total work of art, for which a great deal of effort: to cook the doll, for example, has been specially hired a stylist.
14 tons of material were dumped after Munich, according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the doer.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest was a very special theme: a leather-pants outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, said Gaultier.
Also rode horses old Teddy is seen in the exhibition.
It represents the first, tentative steps towards fashion designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad) in football, he had drawn his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
To play with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
The design of fashion he had later become self-inflicted.
He stole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers, such as Gaultier recounted in Munich.
Later on I bought but then of course.
For his first fashion show, he was not able to pay for the models.
They got nothing, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry as a fashion niche instead of curtain - Plauener lace
In the past it has been in the long stick machines in Plauen to make yards.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were done for clients, for example, processed into blankets and curtains in large quantities.
Now that alone no longer works, explains Andreas Reinhardt, CEO of the fashion Plauen lace.
Instead, the fashion is important.
In the early days of the Plauener lace fashion played a major role, was then replaced by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt cites some examples: in jewellery, accessories such as handbags and in regional folk costumes.
The so-called vintage fashion, which is similar to past eras, form a growing potential for orders.
Anyone who does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
They already make up half of all contracts with us.
Fashion Plauen lace is a member of the industry association Plauener lace and embroidery, along with nine other companies.
They are only allowed to wear the label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of its sales are broken apart.
Private shops and wholesale, there are almost no more.
Our products reach the customers in this way.
The mass-produced goods will be cheaper nowadays manufactured in Asia and distributed almost exclusively via chains.
Also schwÃ¤chle export, up-to-date to Russia and the US.
So, ample reasons for new routes.
The industry association also tried to score through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stick pearl in Falkenstein explains: "since this year we have a quality seal, which shows that we produce environmentally and socially responsible."
Reinhardt said: "it also relates to the materials used."
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxon Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts, and is specialized in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, something you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It will take time and courage.
It creates a tension between the freshest ideas of the designer and the companies that need to think economically, " says Schmidt.
That is why an existing design will often vary only slightly, in order to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter's newly revived historic snowball.
The machine stitched tiny globules in some places.
The Plauener goldsmith, Bianca Hall Bach-inspired KrauÃe became: "before, I could not deal with traditional Plauener lace."
Now she uses the pyramid peak for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, they shaped the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region, identify with the theme of Plauener lace - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers in the USA, Australia and Finland, especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want a memento.
So I see my jewellery as modern ambassadors of Plauener lace.

The economy must open up wider to the outside world in order to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, a group that was responsible for the management of the reform.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how, and to improve the strategies for business startups," he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leading Group for the development of a comprehensive reform.

EU plans to double the mercury limit in carnivorous fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit for mercury in large predators and thus consumers expect a significantly higher doses of the nerve toxin.
The consumer organization Food Watch, which is before a proper working paper from the EU, harshly criticised the plans: "the risks and side effects missed industrial and environmental policies are passed by the full force of pregnant women and infants," said Matthias Wolf Schmidt of Food Watch.
According to Wolf Schmidt should be raised to the limits of the nerve toxin for big fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish for "economic reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predatory fish are already so contaminated with mercury that, on the basis of the current limits, around 50% of the catch may not be sold.
After doubling the limit would then be just 14.5 percent unsold.
In exchange for the easing of the EU, according to Food Watch wants the limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams of mercury to 0.1 milligrams per kilogram.
Food Watch but described it as a "trick" because smaller Fried fish such as carp are usually so low, that they should stick to the planned limits already.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction, that alone helps the economy," said Wolf Schmidt.
Mercury is a heavy metal is highly toxic to humans, which accumulate through the food chain, especially in carnivorous fish.
That is why the Federal Government warns that "very small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system of unborn children."
The German Federal Ministry of Environment said on its website in relation to the current maximum levels but that a "health risk to the general population" was not to be expected.
Mercury is mainly through the burning of coal into the environment.
The German coal-fired power plants emit, according to a written disclosure of the Ministry of Environment, the Green MP Anna Lena Baerbock more than six tons of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount of emissions in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish in roughly the same, the Rhine and the Danube is "permanent and nationwide exceeded," the "mirror" was quoted in the paper in March.
Last year Europe-wide included warnings about mercury in fish are already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
Food Watch reminds consumers to protest against the plans of the EU: www.quecksilber-aktion.foodwatch.de
