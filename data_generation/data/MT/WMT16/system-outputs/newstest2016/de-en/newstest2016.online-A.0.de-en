Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement, as well as Tehran's destabilizing actions in the Middle East.
The meeting will be also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-State solution, which is discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is stretched for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement construction, and accused Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The deal promoted by Obama to the Iranian nuclear program, the relationship between of the two has deteriorated further.
In March, Netanyahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, which partly was seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not discussed with Obama, a meeting had rejected this with reference to the then forthcoming elections in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told with a slightly shaky voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his house.
Lamb, it was important to emphasize that his "cute dog" but still alive and was probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the House, officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a hand-written note was scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me". This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by lamb.
There was no indication that lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had traveled already 300 miles to the school, where he shot a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his Office and killed according to the police.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said that lamb has made the fateful call sometime after that.
Until the end of the day, there was a further death: lamb took his own life, when the police surrounded him up.
A day after the shooting in the University, forcing students and faculty to hide behind closed doors the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated lamb.
That helped by the investigators at both ends of the State of published details, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said that they looked forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned lamb in a book he wrote in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of social sciences and history, whose teaching staff consists of 17 members, and many students attended classes from both.
At the same time, there are some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon beavers, who praised lamb, said he seemed a bit excited and nervous, "as if something is wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that lamb had told him that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014-15 with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, and it said that he had some health problem.
In this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in employment policy of the University meant that the promotion for the Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee of an automatic way to a job as an Assistant Professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that can no longer answer lamb.
After escaping from the campus, the police of later lambs found track when he won back in Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested lamb killed himself selbstmit a.38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a House about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County coroner met Hel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why lamb to this House went, but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb was raised in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University, which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and education.
He earned his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of the longtime friends of lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who some years tried to teach her how to play the guitar.
He was at that time the heart-throb.
All the girls melted away, when he was", said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon resident.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time.
In the emergency, lamb said, "I killed my wife", but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which is adjacent to a bayou in Gautier.
The police said that was the dog in order.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn o' Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago were, but remained friends and had a daughter, which was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated", o' Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were best friends.
O' Steen said he never met lamb, but by his daughter Abigail, he heard that lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss, he and Abigail were both on a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played together the occasional gig.
O' Steen said, his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment Coordinator at the Julep room, a dimly lit bar near the town of Gautier, said that he September 5 for the last time saw lamb and Prentiss night at night, after lamb finished in front of a sparse crowd had finished his guitar and harmonica.
There was no evidence to suggest that there was something wrong.
He said "just a happy couple".
We were cleaning up and joked with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead Professor, led the freshman seminar program and specialized in native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his fraternity and the Student Committee.
On the campus of Delta State in Cleveland, 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community in a candlelight commemoration took part on Tuesday night about.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also at the vigil took part, while the University Choir "bright morning star" and sang "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We try to move our students to return," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Authors Emily wagon first of Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans were Associated Press report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that lamb made the distress call, after he had shot Schmidt, and that lamb Prentiss although described in his distress call as his wife, but there is no indication that that the two were ever married.

Michael j. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "back to the future" was professionally a great moment for Michael j. Fox.
It was for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it I realize little by little, that Princess Diana will sit next to me", he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it comes to me in the sense I am a simulated yawn and an arm's length of them, to be with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in time", a documentary on "back to the future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with Director of Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief Urges all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and to support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member Nations of the Council--United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the edge of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to meet to discuss the situation in Syria this month.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council, and of the Syrian people and the regional powers "make impossible to solve this situation."
Ban called on the five permanent members, to show the same solidarity and unity showed in achieving a nuclear deal with the Iran in addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 polls, which show that Donald Trump is to take seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter, as some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump, down from the upper ranks in polls it did not work (yet).
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump in a double-digit lead, and some start to wonder what it means for the chances of the nomination of the real estate mogul seriously.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was delivered to the ascending Herman Cain, of which no one won only one State in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and Club for growth, a conservative economic group recognize trumps stamina now and start to their dollars, to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey values, indicating that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase.
Trumps popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed just that only two out of ten Republicans positive saw the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
Beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers keep in early States.
In Iowa, a Quinnipiac poll stated last week that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
67 percent of the Republicans said in a CNN/ORC poll last week, they were either "enthusiastic" or "pleased" If Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they were "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they were "dissatisfied" or "angry", when Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would the candidate.
A majority of Republicans does not see trumps temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a President, so ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number is in the first area code State in the nation, the State of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander in Chief, according to the Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he had not the personality to effectively execute his Office, and nearly six out of 10 independent say that suit his temperament not in the White House, according to ABC/post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they wear their hats of scholars, Republican voters keep Trump for real.
When asked, four out of ten say most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a survey by CNN/ORC from last week that Trump was the best bet.
That's a change since the time when four out of ten end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters had in the past not the clearest crystal ball.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
However, shows that a large number of GOP voters view trumps campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to trumps guidance, while the Trump support on more than a dozen other candidates is diffusely distributed.
But a survey of the Monmouth University early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and the most of the other Republican candidates, Trump Garners majority support.
He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina ahead of Marco Rubio 14 points ahead Walker 15 points before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally in front of RAND Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head.
A small majority of fans of Donald Trump says that they have formed their opinions.
A new CBS/NYT survey shows on Tuesday that only slightly more than half of the voters support the Trump, say that they have forgiven their votes out.
Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change the mind.
46 percent said that they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, trumps strongest competition is the other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, at the moment, but voters who say that they have made their opinion, are twice as likely to Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the subject of immigration.
Since two months ago, Donald Trump "Rapist" in his campaign speech called immigrants from Mexico, immigration hub and pivotal point in public discourse was to 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression critical of Trump Hispano Americans from the Republican Party will keep and will damage the efforts of locations.
But after the new ABC/Post poll from Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree the immigration questions with Trump.
As long as so remains the immigration in the spotlight, it will apparently do Donald Trump.
The frustration with the Government climbs to new highs.
About half of the support of Republican voters is on Donald Trump and Ben Carson by their outsider status.
The new Monday poll by ABC/post, six out of 10 Republicans say they'd rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also angry at Washington.
A poll by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans about the Republicans in Congress are frustrated, with 54 percent "terribly upset"dissatisfied"and 21 percent".
Munich, Germany, Sylt and co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea mudflats.
In the street, a square meter of a thatched roof House on average costs 73.300 euro.
"On Sylt, it is naturally limited to the range of objects", according to the study - so that's why the high price.
A new study shows, in which special locations, a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square meter for a dorm room in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top places the price is but like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has a ranking of the most exclusive residential areas in German published - with the price at dizzying heights.
As tens of thousands times are not - per square meter, euro mind you.
But well, if you can... afford it
By the way: Munich is not exceptionally times at the top.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Idol
Double goalscorer in Piräus: Bayern star Thomas Müller has just a run.
A lucky goal by Thomas Müller paved the way for one of the FC Bayern deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then it ran.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze FC Bayern in the mean streets of Piräus have given a dream start in the "Mission of Milan".
The team of coach PEP Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek champion of Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Miller's Double Pack (52. / 90 + 2) and Götzes hits (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start success in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola wants to finally get the handle pot in the third attempt to Munich.
Müller received for his 28th goal in the Champions League Bayern management of Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who pass a shot as edge of the world champion had kindly help.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern Captain Philipp had promised Lahm before playing at the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31.688 hot-blooded fans – and the Munich kept word.
They showed a focused and dedicated performance without shine.
Piräus had won its last six home matches in the premier class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin.
in 2011, also Borussia Dortmund stumbled (1:3).
But the Bavarians, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, wanted to be the next victim.
They went bravely ran in their offensive efforts, but often too unimaginative to works.
The attacks were too often initiated by game shift on outside left Douglas Costa, who rarely came through against the former Brunswick Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had right better luck when his cross from the right half-box in the upper-left corner of the gate.
In the 67th minute, the world champion is awarded the possible 2-0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in half one.
The header of the Poland of the line struck first, as Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown (26.).
Then by direct acceptance, which parried goalkeeper Roberto with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians moved up their usual dominant game, Piräus could put needle sticks.
Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was but.
Example, when he steered a shot over the crossbar from Ideye (56.).
Before new, Guardiola had in the centre next to Jerome Boateng defend a chain of four with David Alaba, which made it good.
Mario Götze, back sat after muscular problems in the squad, first outside.
The World Cup hero had given the green light only after the final training, said Board of sport Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If you want to make something else, that's already malicious".
Also at the first change, Guardiola decided against him, when he brought Kingsley Coman for the battered Lewandowski (59.).
Idol came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it all clear 13 minutes later, penalty, Müller put one on it.
Before the game, it had come to riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly masked Bayern fans had apparently provoked the followers of Piräus hosts with words and gestures in their viewers block, the security forces intervened, and proceeded against the Munich supporters with batons.
At least a Bayern fan was transported injured out of the stadium.
Who smokes, has a higher risk of losing teeth
Who smokes, is damaging not only the lungs but also the teeth - that suggests a long-term study of Potsdam.
The good news: In absence of the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early.
This is from the long-term study by an international research team out, including several employees of the German Institute for nutritional research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk to lose their teeth, the higher 2.5 to 3.6 was in smokers.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
Main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, emphasizes the DIfE.
For these periodontal disease, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The relationship between tooth loss and smoking go back to more frequent gingivitis in smokers.
Is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay.
People who stopped smoking might reduce their risk but within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of dental research".
However, it could take over a decade, until the danger again sink to the level of non-smokers, first author, said Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
You have to convince people to become non-smokers, said Director Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the life time."
Not to smoke is good for the lungs and blood vessels and leads to our findings to good dental health in old age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of loss of teeth are affected, the DIfE said.
Previous research had already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study say the findings.
Archaeologists come across Rhine at Cologne on remains from the late Antiquity
Archaeological finds have been made once again on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
In the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman Germanic Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historical buildings, Museum Director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians in search are for so-called monuments.
For all construction projects in the District of Cologne, the Museum is always consulted as a Department for archaeological conservation of soil.
In the third phase of the Rhine Boulevard, the archaeologists were now looking for.
From text documents had been already known that have a place in the 4th century on the fortress and in the 8th century have been a church, said Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and of the church tower, also a cemetery with some 350 graves has been discovered, which probably belonged to the Church.

EU Commission proposes new Court in dispute over TTIP
The European Commission proposed a major reform of the current system of arbitration to defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and States should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system corresponding to more traditional dishes in its functioning.
"We want to establish a system that citizens trust", said the EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
Sweden intends to present the proposal as European negotiating position in the free-trade talks with the United States.
The German Government announced support.
TTIP is to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
The plans to reform of the current arbitration specifically provide that the EU and the United States select together independent judges for a new investment Court.
Equally, they should come from the EU, the United States and from third countries.
Also a second instance is provided for the first time.
It would allow it to appeal against judgments.
So far, the parties agreed among themselves on referees, there was not an appeal against their sentences.
In the discussion of the last few months had become clear, that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström said.
In the long term, she wants to work out according to an international investment Court.
There, for example disputes between Chinese and EU States then could be sorted out.
The investor-State arbitration required by large corporations (ISDS) are considered as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration can be as a form of parallel justice criticized about the companies at the expense of taxpayers make compensation, national laws nullify or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards of opponents.
In first opinions, TTIP organizations such as Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
It was criticized in particular that they should not apply to the already-negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
German economy State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), however, described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission take into account in the reform of key points, which have developed with other EU trade ministers Minister Sigmar Gabriel in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration tribunals is off the table.
The French Government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Business Association BusinessEurope warned to limit the legal remedies available to the economy through too many new rules.
Particularly small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged as a result, it was said.
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (transatlantic trade and investment partnership) can be completed, remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations since mid-2013.
The subject of investor protection was, however, not discussed so far with the United States.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should be the end of this year.
This date is considered to be no longer tenable.
Delicate folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flip chart on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque state of Michigan with felt-tip pen.
The audience, about 40 people, is nearly taken from Stevens lecture.
He told through various places that he repeatedly draws on the map, what report his minute and delicately arranged songs.
Where they originated and how it looks there, in his home.
Since then is wonderfully creative madman Stevens.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" composed songs that can Nestle harmoniously very close to American folk music in the late sixties, but drift in the great opulent appear wise.
It is the rumor, "Michigan" would be the first part of a swashbuckling series: each of the 50 U.S. States should be sung in a row.
But in 2004, and near the river is already published "Seven Swans" and breaks positively certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens here occurs.
Live guitar and banjo meet him.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: come on feel the Illinoise") a widely acclaimed masterpiece appears in 2005.
Epic of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album entered the American Billboard charts and lacking in any year ranking of influential music media.
After prolific experiments uses Stevens then on "The age of ADF" (2010) very extensive electronic pieces.
This sixth regular Studio album is still more broadly orchestrated, but programmed sequences of beats and playing with all kinds of effect and reverb.
Long ago the smaller clubs emerged from, here are the shows to the colourful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent Bühnendeko.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring as part of a five-member band from Germany.
In the dark Hamburg!
He presented mainly the available since March "Carrie & Lowell" theater.
Although here now almost 2000 guests sit transfixed in their chairs, the much more mature made Stevens back to the intimacy and the folk returns.
Without a Word to the audience, the Group of excellent musicians through the wide-rich album plays out.
From the audience can be heard: the lecture is "opulent" and you can thus the "Plate basically throw away".
Only modestly thanked Stevens to an Encore, plays acoustically a few older songs and finally bows to thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyns debut at Prime Minister's question time
Since his election, Mr. Corbyns debut at question time of the Prime Minister with tension is expected
The new labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut at Prime Minister's question time and mess with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr CORBYN will rise shortly after noon to make the first of his six questions, with its performance by the media likely and the Labour Members closely examined.
He called for "Less theatrical and more facts" at this weekly event.
He has also said that he could skip some meetings, to leave to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyns leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the annual meeting of the TUC on Tuesday.
In the meantime, has provoked the decision of the labour Chairman, to remain on Tuesday while singing the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the battle of Britain in silence criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyns decision to sing not the national anthem, has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr CORBYN said he would have "in respectful silence been" and he recognised the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the battle of Britain".
But a member of Mr Corbyns shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told in the BBC two Newsnight programme he advised the labour Chairman, to sing the national anthem, "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of shadow Ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns top team and they refer to differences in economic, defense and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also within "stack of labour" according to Mr Corbyns statements on the position of the European Union and limit profits.
Mr CORBYN said the TUC Conference that labour submit changes to remove the whole idea of limiting overall.
Mr. Smith, the shadow work and pensions Minister said hours later that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the Government's plans, the limit of 26,000 pounds to £23,000 to lower.
Mr CORBYN will be the fifth labour Chairman, David Cameron, since he became Tory leader, over the past decade on the dispatch box in the House, facing.
The labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and more than 30,000 suggestions were given to him.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's question time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from "Repartee" and fights with barbs both and instead has undertaken, to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges for young people.
Mr CORBYN said Angela Eagle, the shadow economic Minister will represent him if he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is abroad.
He has brought the idea into the conversation, that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he approached John Bercow, the speaker of the lower House, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in the year 2005, Mr Cameron said that he would remove from the policy in the style of a "puppet theatre", which is often associated with the Prime Minister question time is. but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Because it was sent first in 1990 in television, question time was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important barometer of the judgment of the leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that she had become a caricature, and would require far-reaching reforms.

Pound rises through accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose jump-like data, an increase in the wage growth of the UK show. in parallel increased the FTSE 100 by the SABMiller's bid target.
The result without bonuses in the UK by 2.9% over the same period of the previous year was between May and July.
This percentage was the fastest since 2009 and yielded estimates about the timing of an interest rate increase.

The FTSE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20% after a takeover offer of rival from InBev.

Burberry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont 0.9%.
Richemont sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China--a key market for Burberry - again reported growth.

JD sports rose 3.1% after the sports apparel company for the six months had reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million.
The head of JD sports says that higher wages will jeopardize the expansion.
The Managing Director of JD sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers" for UK workers.
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD sports, he added, and that could mean that there are less jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: on Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Only 21 years young, a Linnet with upper chic frise.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is EUR 100 million.
Even more.
There is currently a Monsieur Bieber in Berlin.
And the generation of U17 go crazy.
As Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15 years has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Yesterday, hundreds of fans accompanied Justin.
Among them, Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 am, but the Polish is sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
Bieber construction: Here lives their idol, whose poster hanging abound in Szczecin, since Monday night.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives, costs the day deserves just as much as her Mama Ewa in the half-year.
If at all.
The says: "Actually, my Wiktoria in tenth grade in high school would have to sit."
"I fulfill a dream".
Compulsory education?
Who itches's?
The fans don't.
Also Bieber itself does not.
He has already set for life.
For advertising in the commercial break of the first, he took three million, a two-year deal with a pimple company washed many, many dollars on the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber also.
When Justin Bieber drink a cup of coffee, one marvels at the window pane.
He should have captured so more than 100 million.
Some say that the hype would go too far.
Others stress Bieber is finally in the United States and the United Kingdom with his new single "What do you mean?" at # 1.
The many zeros don't care about Bieber himself, whose fourth album released to follow in November, for the first time.
At least he does so.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to Kartoffeldöner idea
Potatoes or kebab?
It's both - and in the Kartoffeldöner, developed by the Oldenburg snack bar owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "Potato instead of döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement Alhay has put potato and meat on a skewer.
A poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of döner", that he had accidentally seen on television gave him the idea.
Since then, a barbecue spit, which is equipped with meat and potatoes turns in his shop.
"This is multicultural for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea of the Lebanese has you can now enter at the Patent Office in Munich.
There it is protected as a utility model according to the recently.
How much meat and how much potatoes contains the Pike, will not reveal so Alhay.
Just as much: "It tastes even better together", he finds.
Even with its customers, the culinary cultures arrive well.
Met cash launches Bodenständigkeits campaign to combat Aldi-invasion
Met cash tries to protect the IGA stores before an Aldi March in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler met cash has launched an Bodenständigkeits campaign, the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a 700 million $ to defend Aldi invasion.
While Aldi opening two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers met cash and IGA supermarkets and build the brand IGA by mainstream marketing and marketing on the social media, through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice maker Samir from Dunsborough samples distributed in IGA stores and store owners who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
It is expected that met cash released more details of its defense strategy on 29 September, when the wholesaler of food, alcohol, and equipment performs its annual investors strategy day.
There is much at stake because South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of met cash's IGA stores and IGA network in the Eastern States to generate higher profit margins than met cash's.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia, and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, believe analysts like Morgan Stanley that Aldi twelve months after opening its first stores around five percent of the food market in these two States will snatch and all existing actors, but mostly independent retailers sales will take away.
According to a report published this week estimated the analyst Tom Kierath by Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers $360 million sales per year and met cash 250 million $ could lose by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opened 25 stores next year in United States and 30 in WA and a turnover of 500 million $ 600 million and $ will achieve in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery store and the quantities to met cash's high fixed cost base could met cash around 13 million $ profit before interest and tax costs, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, met cash loses market share in the Eastern States, to Aldi and Cole's, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that sales in the food and grocery store by 3.8 per cent will be met cash in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in the year 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in the year 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week the leading Fund Manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan financial group, at a business lunch in Melbourne, told that met cash will likely disappear within a decade. met cash.
Met cash refused to publicly respond to the comments made by Mr. Douglass.
But it is assumed that a Board member of met cash last week has made contact with Mr. Douglass.
IGAs market share has declined since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent, and income from met cash's food and food trade, which supplies 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen since 2012 by 43%, reflecting operational debt reduction for simultaneous pressure on revenue and margins.
The wholesaler resists, however, and invested more than 150 million $, to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by faster-growing fresh food and to provide a better variety of private-label foods.
Met cash's Managing Director Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and loading clean-ups to Elan will grow and hopes that the wholesalers will return again in the year 2017 for the first time in four years to profit growth.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis rather deserves praise as criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise as criticism according to the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, rather for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, the as "special KS" is referred to, Montreal was the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the masters in the spotlight.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon thereafter Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee and Harrison cried out: "Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgios, and I should hit the child."
While he was last seen as he smashed a racket after a spasm of thwarted a potential US Open victory of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in individual Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against the United Kingdom.
"One thing about which I quite ereifere, is the fact that I believe Thanasi a little in the dispute was involved," Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost because of a spasm in the U.S. open, but he is not the first player who broke a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know well enough to know that he is not proud Thanasi.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US open, even in the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think that he deserves a lot of credit.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think that he has been treated a little too severe.
He is a very mature 19 year old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the locker room area, he trained hard, he is in good shape, it is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.
Healy supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios, which starts on Friday, for the important preliminaries and he describes the "joint decision" as a right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term integral part of the team."
"First we want that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around it [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick has risen very quickly, what people like Federer and Murray to have. it goes in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we try, some time out of the limelight, in which he only can think, I appropriate, consider him the consequences of his actions to make. and it is best for the team and it's the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes the border, holding back refugees
Hungary declared a State of emergency and the southern border with Serbia sealed off on Tuesday and detained everyone who tried everything with the aim of illegally in the country to come. to stop the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed on the border, as hundreds of migrants accumulated in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled from violence, were stuck for an unknown period of time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations have increased.
As a police helicopter over them was floating, chanted the migrants "Will open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said that it was "unacceptable" that migrants from Hungary would be sent back, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive.
(Serbia) want to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
It talks must take place in the coming days with Brussels and other countries", said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the block of 28 Nations could agree on a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed, however, to share the responsibility for 40,000 people in the stunned Italy and Greece refuge sought. they expressed their hope from that, next month, or until the end of the year - an agreement would reached that EU States would absorb more than 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary,.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary did not put his hopes on an early action from Brussels or from its neighbors.
State of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they could shut off the roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country was planning the construction of a barbed-wire fence along its border with Romania, in order to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D' Agata reported that even prison inmates to create the barbed-wire fence between Hungary and Serbia, were used in the race.
In recent months, Hungary for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a significant bottleneck and the point of entry into the European Union.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted, however, that are the most of economic migrants, who are looking for a better life, and not war refugees, who are entitled to protection - a view strongly at odds with other EU States, Germany, is among them.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary, crossing the border or damage the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence, which built the Government along the southern border with Serbia, to a crime. these laws set higher sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation, which is caused by the mass migration, the Hungarian Government declared the State of emergency," Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it very clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament must still agree to process even the use of the military, which is expected next week, but reporters from the Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days at the border.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security adviser for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people while trying to cross the border, 15 others had penetrated even deeper into the country.
They come by they damage the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing offences under the new laws.
Authorities are quick to repair the fence.
Hungarian officials signed on Tuesday morning, two of the seven border crossings with Serbia, after a train car with barbed wire, arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near the Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and a crowd of people pressed to roll in there.
About 20 managed it to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary, and said that they would refuse food and water until they may enter Hungary.
Choice 2016: Bernie Sanders ahead of Hillary Clinton's national poll halved
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders her gains compared to ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primary (58 percent previously), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (17 percent increase).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for President, receives support from 15 percent of democratic voters in the primaries.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that your opinion is, which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable than those of the other candidates in their choice.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders scored some gains.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but these projections have been reduced.
Their support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has not materialised, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton has, however, a big advantage among older voters.
Last month Clinton before Sanders was with double-digit lead the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of democratic voters in the primaries across the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when she was nominated by the party.
A quarter would support with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
It is perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporters of her excited.
The views are more mixed for those who do not currently support Clinton--only about a quarter would support enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters in an open question asks why they want that she is the candidate, is followed by the view that it is time that a woman President is (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent) the most common answer that she has the right experience (16 percent).
Of Clinton's supporters, also their connection with Bill Clinton (9 per cent) is mentioned.
Consent to deal with the problems and the eligibility are also cited.
As the Vice President raises a potential for the Presidency in the balance, 57 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it.
When democratic voters in the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party, is Biden at the top.
More than half say of Clinton's supporters that Biden would be their second choice well ahead of Sanders.
Biden, decides not to run for the Democratic nomination Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders, of 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race increases.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this figure of 78 percent has decreased in the last month.
Biden is a second in this measurement by far, but the percentage that "wählbarsten" sees it as the, has increased.
Nevertheless, at the question of what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about eligibility.
Similar as in the last month, not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters to the primaries as unacceptable stands out.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results for some important characteristics among voters of their party primaries.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden performs in the three candidates the best in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters in the primary elections see also Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
About a quarter of democratic voters in all of these measurements has no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue to be made Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during the term as Secretary of State, the most democratic voters in the primaries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole.
But it's a different story in the American public as a whole.
Now, half of Americans is not satisfied with their explanation, while only about one-third is satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March, shortly after came the problem to light.
Most Americans said that the E-Mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion of it had even deteriorated.
There are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, saying that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton by the voters of their party is considered honest and trustworthy, as this is still a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points since May.
62 percent of eligible voters do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters view across the country also Trump as dishonest and not trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump get good marks for leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush cut off best with honesty.
A majority view Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson becomes the next nationwide poll behind Donald Trump
Ben Carson is times in the latest survey by CBS News / New York close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now accounts for half of the support of voters in the new poll, and others lose dramatically on hold
Republican voters across the country continue to support trump in large number. support is growing by 23% in the last CBS poll debate carried news from Fox in the last month, by 27% in the survey Tuesday.
But Carson shot during the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also revealed that Carson hit with demographic groups and Trump surpasses among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is behind with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who most deeply has fallen from 10% support in the last month to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are with 6% in third place.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll, published last week, shows that Carson rises in the polls - he ends up with 19% support for the Republicans behind the Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey showed also Trump before Carson.
Overlooking a Carson rising in the last week of, Trump took some swipes for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized to Trump faith in question.
"We need energy," trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.

Five brotherhood members charged with the death of Baruch College freshman
For almost two years, after a student died during a vexatious ritual of a student fraternity in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College PI Delta PSI fraternity attacked brutally Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013, and police said his transport to the hospital, which has contributed to his death, delayed.
Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand have been charged, and repeatedly attacked while he was trying to go to a frozen field to a target.
Mr.. Deng complained finally of headache, then he fell unconscious.
The PI Delta PSI fraternity members called not the emergency number 911, after Deng was unconscious and the police reportedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital.
They had, however, the time to Deng's clothes to change, to contact his symptoms to Googling and Andy Meng, the National President of the fraternity, in order to obtain advice, said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide items and put the brotherhood basically about the welfare of Michael Deng," said Police Chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng were repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been through the harassment of the brotherhood destroyed. Since 1970, at least one student dies every year of the harassment", said Douglas adapted mountain, a lawyer, represents the Deng's family in a statement.
Brotherhoods and its members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
A County grand jury of Monroe recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are accused also because of oppressive attacks and forming a criminal organisation.
"We want to blame not only the people involved, but if there is an organization, which, officially or unofficially - sanctioned this, so we will take them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked their affiliation with the group.
This will happen if the Fed increases interest rates
Comes an increase in interest rates, and the bull market will be shaken, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slip into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers little guidance to the end for the economy.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and took 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve while raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Federal Reserve have stressed so violently that investors should focus not on when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather is the length of time required for the normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end, market participants, however, may find that all the fuss because a rate increase was may be exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of"cheap money"", said Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at capital economics, in a note to clients.
In contrast, we expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at a too low level, to fear the to the seismic shock, many seem to lead.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effect.
Here is a look based on historical trends, as some areas of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of interest rate increases can make volatile things for a while.
As soon as the increase, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There is apparently a trend stalled investment income 12 to 24 months after the first increase which again reflects the delay in the monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study to what happens after the Fed interest rate increases.
Specifically, the market is in the past 35 years mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rates, fairly flat in the 250 days (average 2.6 percent gain), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six past cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis, the Bob doll, Chief Investment Strategist at Nuveen asset management, at Barron's published.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stocks later tend to occur in the cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but often promote increases in interest rates.
In the current case, the fed with some conditions is facing, which did not exist before and which could speed up a recession.
It is quite remarkable that gross domestic product near its lowest point the Fed's interest rate increases will be.
According to Deutsche Bank was the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes in a so fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it this time is different", said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have made cool all year round on an interest rate increase in the fed, and all eyes were directed the meeting of the Federal open market Committee this week which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study all increase in cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in the GDP have taken place and made previous recession highs very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shade", according to the report.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest, the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far are 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is pretty much the same as on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than for shares, if the change its strategic course.
For bonds, the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will cause that yields between shorter and longer bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds better yields often bring in such a climate, although "we are cautious to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to expectations of fed strategy.
"There are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations" she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, credit spreads have been extended and the volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market if the Fed tightened up its strategy.
On the whole, companies which handle the greater part of their business in the United States, benefit if interest rates rise, and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high levels of debt are worse position, as a rising dollar makes their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debts.
"History shows that"Quality"stocks tend to react, three months after an initial increase in interest rates very positive" Sachs analysts in a report for the customers said Goldman.
Companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded after each of the interest rate increases by 5 percentage points in 1994, 1999 and 2004 an average companies with weak balance sheet.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their stocks exceeded even their counterparts with low quality on average 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, although experts of disagree, how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station because of its "dumbing down"
He argues that it is indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He was also on the BBC Music Awards and said that they imitated only the Brits
Parliament Mr Damien Collins attacked the broadcast of the voice and said that this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament, and raises new pressure to the transmitter, to prove that he is doing something the private broadcasters do not.
The Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham said also the BBC bosses that the public service radio station "verdumme" and is increasingly no longer indistinguishable from its commercial rivals.
"Radio 3 seems - I use the word"dislike - idiots"but it seems to turn to Classic FM", he said.
He was also on the BBC Music Awards, which started in last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started in the last year, seem to be the Brits only under a different name.
So if you try something else to do - this two are spontaneously mentioned examples where you imitate only that what is already on the market", said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director - General rejected the allegations and argued that Radio 3 far ahead of its commercial competitors is BBC, when it comes to live music and public education.
What I'm learning from Radio 3 I will nowhere else learn about classical music.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"And 3, to find new music and to give new works, I think the commitment of radio really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC argued Radio 3 controller Alan Davey that harder work must be done to engage the audience, as it did in the past, because the British of less about classical music are informed.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that it came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on culture, media and Sport Select to enter the commercial rivals on the feet.
The Tory MP Damien Collins attacked the voice - the musical talent show for the BBC, by the Dutch producer Talpa media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ was purchased.
See why this program is discussed often, because it's not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - was produced with Paloma faith and Boy George as a judge - "in a special BBC way".
He added that he hoped that the company "find a hit from our own stable" when it next time start a conversation series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering further rows of the voice in the future or to spend the fee payer for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales in August increased the slowest and the Black Friday can be responsible
In the first three months of the year 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
In the last month, there was the lowest figure since records began in the year 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday has held back spending in November
Virtual shopping boomed for over a decade, and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures 2015 showed only seven percent in the first three months.
Total expenditure on August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 with only a five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed 2015 only seven percent growth in the first three months
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, then that has evolved in the course of time", said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG index of sales the guardian.
He said that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases using their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments such as at home on the sofa.
But now that settles in, and we will experience may reduce the growth.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases prior to this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the last year the average number of buyers gathered five times to their computers to make their bargain, and some merchant sites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where you fought against the buyer due to bargain, could hold buyer, to make purchases.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that of £5 spent a little over 1 pounds was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines more than a third of purchases are made via Web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people clothes and shoes buy online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.

The Health Ministry said that in addition a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of victims were carried through the streets to bury, who were killed when a crane at Mecca's great mosque.
Mourners filled, largely dressed in white, the route to pay their respects, as the first of the dead began their final journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The funeral procession passed in the holy place, where just days before a crane through the roof of the mosque and then on the prayerful crashed.
The bodies were released for burial, as the Saudi King about the family construction company for the disaster, which left also 394 injured, imposed a sanction bin Laden.
The bodies of 29 pray, who were killed when a crane by the large central mosque Mecca, were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage as the crane crashed down.
Mr Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj in the Grand Mosque.
Saudi officials have confirmed already, that the will go on Hajj to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said the bin Laden group should not have stand the arm of the crane, when it is not used.
An Arabic version of the Decree, which was published by the State Saudi press agency, said that the bin Laden group for the collapse was partly responsible.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company are prohibited to travel abroad.
To reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the great mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims on the Hajj, which takes place later in the month, gathered earlier this week promised Salman.
The bin Laden group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane, and their representatives were for an opinion not be available.
The Royal Decree reprimanding the group because not current security measures and because she have not cooperated with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounded Mecca large mosque as part of the massive construction project, which is headed by the bin Laden group.
The family bin Laden is linked for decades with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia and takes over major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was dispossessed by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, only a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people in the hospital stay.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rial (£ 174,000) to the families of those killed are to be paid and the same amount to permanently injured.
Other injured will receive half of that amount.
B & Q boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons increasingly employ artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has rise behind
The result is that 200 more Screwfix stores that target craftsmen, are opened
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for the daily mail city
It is claimed that British people put down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who do the work in their homes,
If you can skillfully handle with a hammer or a brush to paint from walls, they now apparently belong to a minority.
As Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, to carry out home improvement jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, new Managing Director of Kingfisher, who owns the chain of hardware stores, said that a large increase in which number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, provide services at low prices to be outdated now.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops intended for craftsmen and to close 60 outlets from B & Q.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q stores, eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
Men predominate among employees at the moment.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said: "there is still a majority of men in our stores.
We need to move this towards a balance.
Basically half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, one of only five women at the top of British in the FTSE100 index is leading companies, has also its top team umstruktiert to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied with women exactly 50 percent of the team, including its management and Chief Financial Officer.
Mrs. Laury said: "this was a deliberate choice - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and sales after the Group shouldered the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B & Q will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/DOB because of infidelity in court
At the regional court of Klagenfurt two officials of the Austrian volleyball Vice master Aich/DOB due to breach of trust and tax evasion have must answer on Wednesday.
The defendants confessed not guilty.
One of them had been indicted for abuse of authority.
From this accusation, he has been finally acquitted in May.
The current process was postponed.
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel had emerged in the preliminary investigation, that the defendants used funds from the Club's accounts, which they were able to manage in their functions, in the years 2006 and 2011 for private purposes.
He estimated the damage at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also accused of financial crimes.
This fact was the Chairman of the Senate of the jury, judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
To the wastage of infidelity, the Defense pointed out that a financial loss caused the Association at any time.
The sports officials had charged only allowances and out the sports club had for whom she worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which she invested time and money, out of debt - the liabilities amounted to approximately 600,000 shillings (about 44,000 euros) in 2001.
"At that time we were faced with the situation: we continue the club or we close down?", told one of the defendants, in the lack of large tax accountant.
With his colleague and co-defendant he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We have shot for money, made our life insurance as collateral at the Bank," he said at the hearing.
Had been agreed with the Association: you can freely manage the money, just no debt may be made.
Furthermore be - with appropriate financial - success the payment of allowances retroactive to 1991 decided been.
Therefore you have a portion of the expenses until years later, namely from the year 2003, as a plus on the account had been paid out.
Therefore, also package and not detail charges seemed, explained the former Chairman of the operations.
The accounts and passbooks managed the two defendants together, said the second accused.
Why the payouts not in detail had been published in the Association, asked the judge.
The Club have not been interested in the detail for financial management, only the pursuit was important, so the answer.
When in 2011 against a the official investigation for abuse of Office, an amount was transferred from 120,000 euros to the account.
Reserves were, the defendants said.
This trading account in the name of the second accused, and was not aware of the association according to the statement.
"Why?" asked the judge.
That the respondent knew long no answer.
Then, finally, he said he believed that this was the best for the Club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known some of that money was the Prosecutor in the room.
The co-accused had been informed, the official explained himself.
This transfer was formulated as"damage".
Why make good damage?, judge and public prosecutor wanted to know.
On the first defendant said that he had been not agree with this wording, because never was a damage to the Club.
But what should I do if the lawyer says: "With all of you are off the hook".
"I am a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said he had never a penny content based, charged he had only mileage and diets.
On diets he set the Association 1,000 euros per month, the actual cost was much higher, he added.
The defendants could not have accurate records for the early years.
They had no longer been kept after an audit in which everything correct had been assessed, they said.
Also the second defendant had obtained a mileage allowance.
All fixes have been made in cash, that he have to drive from his home in international market for the Bank to Bleiburg, he said in his statement.
The hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.

Time of the decision on interest rates on the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the Fed meets in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision, whether the interest rates are raised for the first time for nearly a decade.
A survey among 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half, the only last week of the view was that the Fed will do so, now think that the Fed will remain longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 per cent will keep.
It is a historic event because it is seven years since the Fed interest rates to zero.
"We approach a situation in which a large Central Bank may leave the zero-field and starts a process of normalisation of interest rates for the first time", said Angel Ubide, senior associate at the Peterson Institute for international economics.
The US economy is at a relatively high level of performance, trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generating only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy Outlook on global conditions.
She has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the indications are that the odds are against such a move are good.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET
Death shot at Delta State University left letter of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before he shot his colleagues later in the day and killed - Shannon lamb wrote a note, to say that "sorry do him" at the first murder and wanted "he could undo it," authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that called lamb, Professor of geography and social science education at the Delta State University, the emergency number around 10:00 on Monday morning
and said he had shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb said the staff of the emergency that the police had to send police officers to his home.
"I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "cute dog" in the House is, but "will disturb no one", but will be probably excited, he said.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police came onto the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from lamb, 45, said: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me".
After writing the note, lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a Professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday night when police officers surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday, lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" for a "love triangle".
Prentiss was of Shawn O'Mara Steen, who stated that they were married for about seven years, described as a "good person".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O' Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated".
He said that Prentiss were her daughter of "best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named lightning, met for about three years with lamb.
"She wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that lamb had called relatives at some point on Monday to tell them "he will not go to jail".
When police officers brought him on Highway 1 near the town of Greenville later in that night, drove his car to the side of lamb, fled on foot, ran into the Woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate in 2015 from Delta State University, as his Lebenslau on the website indicating University.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this cry brought the left fullback and will close it for at least six months of playing, Louis van Gaal hope doesn't give up that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after the 20-year-old Shaw in the PSV area was broken up.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture of the leg and is in the hospital."
He will tomorrow or maybe a day later and then surgery in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it has very hard and then fantastic plays, and then this happens.
In the locker room, he had an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then that lasts for six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
I hope that he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee has not punished the Mexicans.
Van Gaal thought that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty kick and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet to Shaw's account was: "I thank you for your messages. words cannot describe all of you, I'm as tired, my road to recovery starts now, I will come back stronger."
This related: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
The England Defender has an added incentive to recover until next June with the European Championships in France.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It is a very bad injury."
If a player with that kind of injury leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico against van Gaal Holland team at the World Cup 2014.
"It is difficult very because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you then hear that it is a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction, so that it looked as if he [Moreno] touched him had, but I could see not the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know, how it feels, I know how hard that can be.
I feel very bad about. so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital, following a challenge by Chris Smalling.
Certainly better knows David Cameron The Lorax?
It's one thing soon learn all parents: If your child loves a book, it is not long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.
When he was asked to name his favorite children's book by a provider of childcare systems the Prime Minister chose the Lorax, the 1971 published environmental fable of Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company of SuperCamps, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read my kids, because there seems to be a picture or a message that we've been missing."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph in the Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead a summary the film version of 2012 reflects, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the walled city Thneed-Ville, where all of nature is gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, he met her desire to see a real tree, by", reads one. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, the real name of Theodor Seuss which was hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
If it still not suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film, which will be presented on the Web site of Internet movie database and so begins: "In the walled city Thneed Ville, where everything is artificial, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits Yes to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron the plot of the book as little familiar is an unnamed boy, like the yarn local environment through the Thneed of money-grubbing, be felled trees, once-ler despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a crouching, moustached creature "that speaks in the name of the trees", listen here is devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task to a helper has been delegated, not 20 times in a row has read the Lorax a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text probably came from Cameron's electoral district office.
SuperCamps confirmed but no more immediate comments that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, was.
Adam Lyth was threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
Is a difficult task to come to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, but when you see the squad, England has selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my card.
I would not rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook's side is less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they will carry no scars of 2012, only a teen positive attitude.
Moeen Ali developed as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid with the ball, even if it is an unknown quantity at the test level, is an option for the attack.
News related to this: Adam Lyth withdraws from the England test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to let Adam Lyth, is of course for me as his head coach in Yorkshire, hard to parse.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players on results are aligned.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led players to the nomination, because - and I have said this before - are their own best selector.
Long ago, you would have extended the run of Lyth, but he was in control of his own destiny.
If he beats out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire, comes another chance.
The England coach of Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not so well, and that doesn't surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test batsman gets to put his mark, is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to home and away.
The only charge that you can charge was that England was Jonathan Trott set in in the Caribbean – first as a Lyth in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a hit man, I value a.
He is an X factor cricketer, what we early saw at Yorkshire this season, when he scored 236 against us on a Trent bridge place, what really hit us.
It must have at least the same opportunities as those ahead of him, but of course this depends on the line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, hitting Moeen in addition to Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four Quicks, appeared, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a batsman there can not do, and this left-hander has already shown that he is a devil of a fellow of cricket players.
Moeen has perhaps not done his job for his County Worcestershire, but is he a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
He joined as an opener in 2001, my former team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop.
He has managed three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he really impressed me as a young man.
People might see his stats on - average 31 with the bat and the ball 35 - and think it's a punt, but there is no large number of backup kooks who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made a couple of clever additions with the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, which will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the Setup.
I always felt that he is created for the international cricket competition as a player or as a coach, and how Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air even if the messages in accordance with the above.
Collys team-mate at Durham, Ben is not used Stokes, in the one-Dayers, root received a similar break against Australia and for my part, I have no problem with that.
Although some will not agree, but coaches and team operators determine not the schedule.
And you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are made not light hearted.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = exit Britain from the EU) could win at inlet if the economy up to the year 2017 in a lull
David Camerons half-baked renegotiation strategy, to keep Britain in the EU, is with each passing day more deeply get into trouble, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "it is Yes or no?" CORBYN, Director of labour or the TUC, which itself fell sharply because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have also their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend said recently that some Member States, so deeply involved in various crises such as the EU is it and not getting out of their own debt, Britain's own agenda with split concessions and disruptive changes to the Treaty, which most of the time they do not want are fed up.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it also doesn't like this, if they endanger the social protection.
We could call it Dave and Georges Selfies agenda.
Prime Minister and Minister of finance climb to the Summit and bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, the one for outside lighting UK inside the EU tent wishes - "Let us not only with France", says Berlin - and hints that more and more short-sighted Ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point, where it is they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but it has been 10 years in power and wants to leave the Office before it looks bad for them as it happened with the excessively long waiting out like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and cabbage (16).
France's François hollande looks at his re-election or its replacement in the year 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland has a left a nationalist right-wing Government, Spain may soon.
It is difficult to imagine that they will bend over backwards to, to help the Selfies British, whose Energie should be used better for Scotland's exit from the UK to prevent - something they also do not want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore some such Ministers even deliberately unhelpful comments in the SNP style might plan during Britain's referendum campaign 2017, in order to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bust," and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory, the fleet can be street at their expense and the oligarchy of the press barons is what EU skeptics, as they in 1975 but were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can contact weak Boris Johnson, remember ore euro opportunists, who has made a name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90's.
In all of his craziness, Ed Miliband knew who were his enemies.
This includes the medley of tax have villains, phone hacking aliens and the pseudo belonged to non-residents, who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought much about it, but found that if you sit down with a hot gorilla in a cage, you spread better bananas to distract him, rather than for his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairianer than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum back, because Blair had been the principle of the Constitution not adopted the EU, which then was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door for him.
The press has never forgiven that.
But the Nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave a friendly Pat on the back to me on Monday at Westminster - I told him that he needed no time to waste for me anymore - seems in danger of Neil Kinnocks boycott Murdoch strategy of 80 years to repeat a mistake then and now.
It may take, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to attract the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, the BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyns official position to Europe – I say time friendly - in development.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, outside of Ukips traditional blue dye tendency and the Wilder realms of Tory small Engländerismus everyone can say most people Yes.
It is what this week said Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and on television as the Scouts in it struggled not to admit that Corbyns appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his father tried on television about to be disloyal to his labour Cabinet colleagues not to go too far and lose his Cabinet job.
Hilarys fight was even more attractive.
To fight, but to stay "in all circumstances" - Benns expression - was not what said McDonnell, still what JC told his comrades and members by all accounts at its closed-door meeting on Monday night.
You are thinking what will - give always the sentimental image of bottom-up from CORBYN that he has stirred even me - news discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock important and above all in the vortex of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to give Cameron no free pass for Europe, which allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said it goes without saying.
Simon Jenkins thinks certainly so.
But McDonnell and Corbyns fundamental ambiguities to EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents for the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.
As Tom Watson is rock solid with its ambiguities to NATO - convinced that JC is launching a campaign to exit the - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors in all at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital – they have also suspicious voters – to make concessions to the British when all this may be pointless?
The United States are already quite disappointed by the poor military performance in the Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting the Tory Government in power, what I was reminded of something at the start on Monday, what British influence security forum called.
Experts criticize public health England report on E-cigarettes
Allegations of a State-funded agency that E-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British medical journal (BMJ), joined Lancet by criticizing the of public health England (PHE) used evidence in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE in last month published the "policy report" and describes him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on the PHE founded his main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have wondered whether the claims "based on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects, that the claim of PHE, that "The current best estimate is that E-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, comes this statement from a single session of 12 people, who were called up to be a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis (multi criteria decision analysis - MCDA) to develop, to get their opinions on the harm of nicotine-containing products into a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss health, whose Managing Director before should have benefited American tobacco (BAT) of British for an independent study.
He signed the references of the BAT to the public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that to get funds from an E-cigarette manufacturers but they added not the financing, he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of members of the Board are not included, but include several well-known E cigarettes champions, of which some specify the paper industry funding.
Some other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
Also the tobacco line of PHE took part in the meeting.
The research of group "admits significantly," that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products for most criteria", McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report is discussed.
McKee and Capewell said that were the allegations of PHE, that 'there no evidence so far is that E-cigarettes are used as a way to smoking for children or non-smokers' premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the allegations of BMJ previously has been responded to.
He said: "E-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of E-cigarettes in comparison are low, but that we have continued to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform of the public about what evidence shows and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds a year.
By the clear presentation of current evidence that E-cigarettes without risk are, but represent only a fraction of the damage of that is caused by smoking, we meet our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former Chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop programmes such as EastEnders and the voice send. He said that commercial rivals "her right arm would give" for hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used to make the kind of programs which will not be sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for that to place public service programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, highly controversial window against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said, the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he tried for six years during his time at Channel 4 without success to come with the BBC in contact.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes commissioned or sends, which would also clearly of non-subsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee within the framework of his inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the licence fee, which I in the medium or long term not consider a good idea, you should the others not to make its production at least on programs, or Commission.
They send the voice in a prime time, because they want to achieve as broad support for their future.
The idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense, of course.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax funded programs could be financed without subsidies.
The voice is such a programme, EastEnders is an another, admittedly both in-house productions.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I try to see how this is to be public television.
I don't think that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is to blame in the hunt for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people of who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments to the BBC's most popular programmes reflect that the former head of sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, suggested that the BBC shows such as EastEnders should sell.
Johnson said that the rather public niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you pretty much can't, measure the audience but they perform their tasks, and they can argue if they on their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion £ licence fees go,"well, of course, we have created all of these obscure programs that no one has seen.""
They put them in a window of time in which no one ever wanted to see her.
To the licence fee, Johnson told the Committee: "I urge you to find who can get the best value from it a more regressive system in terms of conditions.
Of course, you all think we all think that one for £150 per year here a great value for the 150 gets, but for people, £ is a lot of money, wonder if that's true, because they consume much of the BBC.
The former sky and channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who testified before the Committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review their Reithian mission "to inform, to make and to entertain".
He said little of the BBC production would be classified officially as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% in the radio - and she should take on the public broadcasters in Australia and Canada an example this change to "inform, educate and entertain".
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which he said that only a handful of TV shows and with commercial channels enter alliances, to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematode change the direction at the moment, in which they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems, which can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematode change the direction at the moment, in which they have the frequencies too high for the human ear to be heard, are irradiated with pulses of sound.
The pulses work by the switching of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Further information on this topic: researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, can be used with ultrasound to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the guardian that the procedure one day could replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that emits electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes do not respond normally to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did, when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, reinforce the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves effect on structures, the TRP-4 ion channels are called and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are associated with, according to a report in nature communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematode, Chalasani changed genetically so that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels carry the worms.
When applying ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves through the micro bubbles are transmitted more and the worms where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists, neurons with pulses of light on and turn it off.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that must be revealed to an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain can low-frequency ultrasound waves pass through unhindered tissue and can be sent from the top of the skull into the brain.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments", Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right at your doorstep!
The ads embarrass Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International anti-weapons trade shows video.
Terrible killer drones!
Leg cuffs zerschmetternde ankle!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause excruciating pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and the cartoon pictures leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a combative parody, produced by Amnesty International, to bring the British Government into the spotlight, to sell arms to repressive regimes on the defence and security equipment international Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign leads also to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in subway trains and requiring a second look.
"Important announcement: drive from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) read the London underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which transforms into the image of a tank in the fonts.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers with the DLR will drive... customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped in the distribution in London and used "ad space hack packs", a 6 lb pack of Allen, of which it is claimed that "one third of the bus stops advertising spaces on the planet gain access to around."
Transport for London is not amused this Plakatier-"Vandalism".

After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, will be critical to artists and try to bring political work outside galleries to the public.
Many artists make themselves with activists within protest movements to work and realize that after out there in the real world have to go so that her art has an influence on the society.
Another of the anti-trafficking posters greets commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, a non-profit working with the graphic designer and voiceover artist who works for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt lever was amazed by the silence that prevailed - with a blank space of the ExCeL calendar - the advertising of the arms fair and thought: "we give them the campaign, trying to avoid them."
They played with the invention of a more realistic dodgy advertising but "by the Bluing with bright colors and animation it sticks more."
"You have done a fantastic job helping us to raise awareness on the sale of illegal torture devices at the show," says Tom Davies of amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices not on our doorstep are traded illegally.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from within Excel, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order of the U.S. Army on "the AT4CS fired from the shoulder RS."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead, which delivers outstanding Nachwirkungs effects on the inside of the target."

Eight golden rules for living in student residences
Eleven years ago, I moved as a young 19 year old in a dorm room, still in the belief in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smile of that I have - annoyed and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned, can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The move into student housing ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
It's tempting to talk: tell people where you're from, if and where you took sabbatical, where you stand in terms of CORBYN and why "neither love nor hate, because seriously, guys, it's only a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room Marmite honestly you."
Breath.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those that you would not speak, even if your lashes were on fire and that fire extinguishers would be.
Let people.
The rooms of people transform venues and communal gathering places often in drinks receptions, movie night, but they are also the places where people get dressed and put her underwear.
This involved: not remember to start at the University with a relationship
Introverts get rough treatment at the University.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a room to room shopping culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say: "I like you, and I want that our friendship will continue, but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student of socializing is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a non-locked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship close by baking.
As you begin the University at the peak of the back-mania, the knock on the doors of people is less strange than the greeting of the 1950s to present with a plate of Brownies, "welcome in the neighborhood, I have you baked something. so, and please smile when I ask you some personal questions."
To offer homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Her roommate feel obliged to entertain and will associate your face with a tasty morsel at the end of May.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent Baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause that people be sleeping when you knock on the door.
There is a common crime in student dormitories to steal food.
Of course, the claws of chicken is a theft, but it is also taking a drop of Milchs for tea?
Check with the owner of the milk.
The chances are good that they say to use, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, this is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try so balanced to deal as my roommate, who added a detergent to their milk to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
You should make no noise, which prevents people from sleep or work.
It is not simply to be a decent person, but that you are in the truest sense of the proverb to the people, in the glass house sitting.
A girl in my Hall asked their neighbors, whether it matters you, drum & bass to put something down because it three o'clock in the morning, and she had in the morning a test.
You have responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 o'clock, she let her neighbors kindly two hours sleep before she all had their own music, completed her door and went to their three-hour exam.
Would it not romantic if your future spouse would randomly move into the same dorm?
Conversely, it would be not profoundly embarrassing if you keep a roommate for your future spouse, to make them turn back and see every day have to and perhaps see how she pulls across all mutual friends to?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, you at least try to convince your abdomen a little reason.
In the exciting moment you notice that someone has leave his keys in his not locked room, the line between a prank and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it takes only moments until it becomes a boomerang.
Give a valuable and fun lesson about security - by hiding but never mess up one's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock your door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but not more than twice down staple their possessions on the ceiling.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low-income earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds houses for people who don't have much money in the Middle Franconia corners Valley.
So for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need Wohnhraum, but also the single mother and the low-wage earners."
"I'll show how you can build even today still cheap and good," says the 44-year old in the interview
Thousands of refugees are entering the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how fast can create more affordable housing: it builds in a project row houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees are entering the housing market.
What solution do you have?
Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the refugee flow, we need sufficient living space in the coming decades.
Very simple, three-story townhouse is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house takes up the least space.
It facilitates the integration.
This is different, bringing among the people in apartment buildings.
Each of the six houses of that are built in the pilot project consists of three units for four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it's peace again, I will go back.
Then, the houses can easily be converted according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euro, without land.
This is straightforward.
The construction took six months.
This is appropriate.
Have the building regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: Building regulations, I have carried my project correctly.
Always the impending threat of special construction and parking regulation makes it very complicated.
Creepy.
It is still, who creates three apartments in a terraced house, needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities, the place is missing for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did people react to their row House project?
Gildner: There, who have accused me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What definitely is wrong.
But exacerbate not the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: Is true: we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years, but were built luxury apartments, which hardly any more can afford.
My project has the message, even normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-wage earners.
I will show how you can build even today still cheap and good.
That's what.
Markus Gildner (44) studied micro-system technology in Regensburg, first with environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How do you get the new iPhone operating system, Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, tap on "General" and then select "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some are encountered after installing problems, because they get an error message stating that the "software update failed".
To work around the problem, is recommended to wait until the rush back either users or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.
That may mean deleting apps may, space - but has the Apple through the streamlining of the update made less likely. as well it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall it once the process is complete.
It is worth to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is close to a charger, so that the battery is charged.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow, that the update will continue, because the phone may shuts down halfway and this could lead to a crash of the update.

Rosbergs only currency: full attack
In the battle for the world title in the formula 1 against its clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg knows only one motto: "Full attack".
The World Cup second stressed before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I nothing left to lose".
53 points separate the Vice World champion before the night race in Singapore on Sunday from title holder and twice champion Hamilton.
The Briton won seven of the previous 12 races of the season and also takes the floodlit Grand Prix in the City State as a favorite in attack.
in 2009, and last year the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the City State on the Grand Prix of Singapore will have influence, is still unclear.
A haze over the city hangs for days, caused by fires on the island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club founded three months ago, "chess friends Bad Kissingen" has recorded another Member in its ranks, thus the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new Member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who was in Bad Kissingen to cure more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is winner of the Bundesverdienstkreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the towns of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
In Bad Kissingen Gauselmann has supported the chess club with a donation, Chairman Alfred Klein accepted.
Thus, it is possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the Chess Club, and also friendly contact with the Tennis Club "Red-white" is seen as an expression of his attachment to the spa town.
District Office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the center of Toni chapter have joined together under the umbrella of the Foundation and opened a new focal point on the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consulting, you can participate also in courses.
The social foundation pulling it down from the mountain to the city centre.
On the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
There, a new District Office was recently opened.
Get here, right next to the shopping market as of now elderly and seeking advice information on issues such as long-term care insurance or services of health insurance and care funds.
For years, we find with our outpatient nursing service that often caregivers alone are left.
There are endless questions.
"Also often many services of funds cannot be taken because hardly understood the complexity of the insurance companies", explained the new landlady Jutta Weigand, which old people's welfare to Toni monastery and the Civic Hospital, as well as for the outpatient service of "Amadeus" as business unit manager is responsible.
In addition to the deliberations, the new District Office offers health courses, but also prevention and wellness.
To do this, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional services such as fall prevention, memory training, or physiotherapy treatment.
The offers of the Senior Center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, preparedness and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Center for assistance and care", described Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
Both business leaders especially in the demographic change will see the reason for the opening of the new District Office in the city centre.
For this do indispensable a good local infrastructure in the districts of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, so Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasized during the inauguration festivities, the District Office of also of isolation at the age dedicate themselves: "there are numerous events and offers on the program and invite them to a regular social gathering".
Thus, the Foundation did a great contribution that seniors can live independently and well in their familiar environment.
The District Office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14, Tuesday and Thursday from 4 to 6 P.m. and on Saturdays from 10: 00 to 12: 00.

Viennese architect Karl Mang 92-jährig died
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of the Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, the Künstlerhaus announced Tuesday.
Mang with the Künstlerhaus lose an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the press release.
born in 1922 in Vienna, architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann studied Mang during and after the second world war.
Since 1952, he worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer, and Director.
From 1972 to 1983, he was President of the Austrian Institute of design.
In the 1980s, he was charged with the establishment of the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the renovation of the Palais LOBKOWITZ in the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Park penalty: Tim Wiese throw police woman with money
Ex-soccer player Tim Wiese offense noticed in Bremen.
Soccer player was once, is now Tim Wiese, ex - national goalkeeper engaged in Germany and Bremen and Hoffenheim, professional wrestler.

Intellectually he not recorded against it.
Meadow had in the city centre of Bremen cut just the hair when he saw outside a parking space guardian issued a speeding ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Meadow then stormed out of the business, insulted the officer and threw the due fine at the feet, as reported by the "Bild" newspaper.
In the city of Bremen, confirm the allegations, but is about the consequences for the unusual incident not yet in the clear.
"The thing is still in the test", it is called the city of Bremen.
Then, it will be decided whether the field is displayed or not.

Croatia: "we let through the refugees"
"Now be raised border controls also on our southern border", said Home Secretary Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
At the same time have the controls at the Hungarian border.
Still, it is clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum, could make this "without saying".
The supply and safety of people stand in the foreground.
Clear is also "that it needs clear signals", said the Minister.
The people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows not across the Austrian Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering "Corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian Government had previously communicated also Slovenia wants to continue arriving refugees towards Austria and Germany can and may build also corridors for the refugees.
So this did not, however, see Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will rather intensify the monitoring of the border - to Hungary -.
The border with Croatia is, however, already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
The Minister stressed that Slovenia will not block but its borders to refugees thus.
"Each EU Member must complete its obligations, otherwise the system may not work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian Government, the first refugees had already tried during the night hours to Tuesday in eastern Croatia on the border crossing Tovarnik/SID past to enter to avoid the registry.
The Croatian police could pick up on it in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media police vehicles arriving since then in the Croatian Tovarnik constantly with new refugees.
It is mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Also, emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days his country expected about 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo would be redirected to on the Macedonian Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported unanimously on Wednesday.
The Government in Belgrade however denied it that way the people to embark on specific routes: "Neither can we nor we want to do this", it was said.
According to the media reports a first bus had arrived at any rate in the morning with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of SID, more buses would be expected in the course of the day.
Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been travelling all night from the approximately 500 kilometres away Macedonian border with Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary is permanently closed, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
You wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
So it could be actually the shift of the previous Balkans route Turkey Greece Macedonia Serbia Hungary already predicted by observers to a slightly more westerly route.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country in the event of a heavy influx of refugees prepared plans for possible emergency situations.
He did not name details, he pointed out that Croatia had as a non-Schengen Member "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
We perform strict controls, in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
This is part of the Slovenia since 2007, the EU partners issue since then consistently a good report card the country, concerning the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side continue to about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they would have spent the last night at the border crossing at Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain still completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border, is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister to reassure tried Wednesday morning at a local inspection in Horgos Nebojsa Stefanovic: He thought the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed, too early.
It would not be currently very high numbers of refugees.
You could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helper advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already begun to distribute maps, which are alternative routes through Croatia to the refugees.
Crossing the border between Serbia and Croatia is, however, not without danger: in parts of the border area, there is still not always cleared minefields 20 years after the end of the Croatia war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team has been sent by mine deminers in the border region.

Ecumenical Hospice help Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheim parade ground busy.
People do their errands, some quick steps, sometimes cozy corporations.
You control the two stations of the Mannheim car show at the Paradeplatz.

"Only if I clear do that for me the end of the world comes, I can responsibly live", says the Director of the diaconal work of Mannheim, Germany, which holds the Ecumenical Hospice help together with the Caritas.
Therefore, this high-profile action to the 20-year was good.
That not everyone on the boards publicly to share with, but understandable, after all it was a very personal thing.

FedEx earnings mixed, reduced financial Outlook for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the shipping giant lowered its profit Outlook over a year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said a profit between $10.40 and $10,90 making in the fiscal year that ends next may, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting, according to a survey by FactSet $10,84.
The lower view comes despite the price increases, which on average amount to 4.9 percent and will take effect on 4 January and higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages that are collected from November.
The company said that it still expected earnings compared with the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenues and growth in online trading will increase.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid returns, given the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade into account".
The plans for the holiday employment were announced one day later than those of rival UPS, who plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned 692 million $, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, the twelve of Zacks investment research, surveyed analysts predicted.
Sales rose by 5 percent to 12.3 billion $.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected 12,23 billion $.
FedEx has recorded a decline in the international priority shipping, which brought revenue in its express unit to stagnate in recent years.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results with FedEx ground.
In the last quarter, sales at the ground transportation by 29 percent, but operating profit was flat due to higher costs for larger packages and auto insurance basically.
The express unit reported higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings due to higher labour costs in the freight business fell.
In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150,15.
On Tuesday, they closed at 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve spend strategists two days this week around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table sitting to decide whether it's time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Looming above them at one end of the ornate, two-story meeting room a mural of the United States is.
The card is a reminder that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from Congress: maximizing the US employment and prices here hold.
But since the great recession the Fed acknowledged leaders that there was an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow, it to predict. it is announced on Thursday, whether the U.S. economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Although most of the data show the economy that she grow steadily, could the recent turmoil in the global financial markets make the already cautious fed representatives anxious to reinforce this volatility by raising the interest rate for government bonds - and be it only by a quarter percentage point.
"Obviously the labour market and inflation primarily will be, the most important thing what they observe", said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economist at the broker firm Stifel Nicolaus & co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed intends to do, what unsettles to itself the financial market.
About half of the economists who were surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets expect a wait for the fed, with a key indicator that displays only a 30% chance to increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market, if the Fed raises the rate, unless the strategists to soften the blow, they pledge that a further increase is far.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial jumped average by 228,89 points or 1.4% to 16.599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed's policy maintains the set this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's capital markets research group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at this time", he said.
If she does, "she would have to go very far in its statement to reassure the financial markets so that they are not panicking."
Other experts argued that an interest rate hike would reassure the financial markets, because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
The Fed is on track to increase, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month seemed to be a month ago.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expect an increase in the rate this year despite the complaints of Liberals, that more economic progress would be required.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the last month, the lowest for more than seven years, and in the vicinity of the level, the view the fed as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And even though inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at the Pantheon of macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world flashed together late last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell in the may by more than 16% below its all-time high, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now is up by almost 10% below the high of May.
For the representatives of the fed, the market turbulence affect the complex calculation when you should raise interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last not occurred few weeks, they would attract the reins at this meeting", said Stephen D. though, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for real estate and a former employee of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Now, he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better handle the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," said though.
None of the Fed's main concerns is the health of the global economy, therefore she should not involve technically in their decision making.
But in the end the Fed monetary authority of the world has become.
The influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years.
The mere reference to the former leader Ben S. Bernanke triggered in 2013, that the Fed "could narrow its monetary expansion", confusion around the globe.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, can be that they monitor not only the developments elsewhere, but consult with other central banks and experts, to provide a better understanding of the global economy expected by the Fed's representative.
Their decision making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for the asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noticed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreaction to financial market movements with not seem associated with the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal open market Committee, de cited decisions in the years 1998/1999 as an example set for an interest rate hike.
A financial crisis in Asia led to the fed to reduce its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited visible impact on growth in the United States", said Lacker.
A year later the Fed representatives made these cuts back.
The Fed should aspects of financial stability during a major crisis such as the collapse of the market 2008 first put, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Committee for determining the interest rate the Bank of England.
The recent turmoil will not come close to this level, he said.
"She will not be certainly the situation, in which she is afraid of an increase in interest, because the markets worry", said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for international economics.
The Federal always contains Reserve Act still this double mandate and mentioned the financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think that she should be ahead of time.

Brazil's paediatric society Rio Grande promotes diet for a healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian Pediatric organization SPRS is trying to elucidate how important good nutrition during lactation is. does this with the presentation of images of babies who suck on breasts, which are painted with depictions of unhealthy foods in shocking fashion women.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers is advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research findings suggest that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment, should make mothers.

Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sports Hall
The Municipal Council of Bernried approved the planning application for the 2.3 million euro Sports Hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof should be flat for solar system.
Plans for the long-awaited gymnasium construction at the Bernrieder sports area step by step progress: in the most recent Council meeting was unanimously endorsed the elaborate planning application without major discussions.
Previously, the Panel decided to include an application for a construction law "exception" or "Liberation" from the current development plan.

Therefore, a "saddle roof with non-central first and roof overhang" will be built.
Planning is the intended use of the roof for solar panels: "As a result we get together a wonderfully large roof of the South", declared at the meeting Mayor Josef Steigenberger.
The "liberation" was, in turn, to the roof inclination, which should be below 10 degrees for energy reasons – other than prescribed in the zoning -.
This significantly reduces the volume of the Hall.
A "liberation" was necessary because the development plan with regard to the roof pitch is no "exceptions" - where the Bernrieder rather restrictive moves Municipal Council normally for exemption applications.
The gym building is, however, no recurring project: "We create no precedent", so Steigenberger.
The gym at the Sports Centre is a joint project between the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros are included at cost.
Grants are expected from the school and grassroots support.
In the next step, the planning application for the 18 x 36 meter Hall is now submitted to the District Office for the examination.

Refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial recording accommodation after the first three months of their stay.
Many then encounter the housing market and ranks in the long queues in front of the rented accommodation.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, half of all asylum seekers for rent lived less than in the last year.
The negative development of the housing market is not only the rising numbers of refugees.
The study is also significant omissions in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany put a housing deficit before him, which is growing from year to year.
Currently, approximately 770,000 units, were missing in the metropolitan areas complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities inevitably in shared rooms.
Young adults were due to the downturn in the housing market involuntarily in the "Hotel Mama".
In large cities the number of square meters per capita dropped for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance of "Social housing" proposes a reboot.
In doing so, new incentives to stimulate social housing again.
So could the tax be avoided and are exposed to the real estate tax for subsidized apartments limited.
In addition, attractive tax depreciation allowances are necessary according to the Alliance.
The support programme for refugee shelters in the State Bank KfW is now well in cities and towns.
A week after starting more than half of the available around 300 million euros had been called off on Monday evening with 184 million euros already.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have safe passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
Hungary is practically impossible to get through more, as more and more refugees choose the path of Croatia.
Zagreb announced to grant transit via Slovenia to the North without hurdles.
The route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to communicate with neighboring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke with the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if it is necessary, we will arrange a corridor", the Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country.
After the foreclosure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees are broken up after Croatia, to get from there to Western Europe.
The Croatian television station RTL were 500 people come across the border at Tovarnik, reported.
Hungary had sealed off its border to refugees on the previous day.
New laws that came into force on the same day, practically eliminate, moreover, ordinary asylum procedure in Hungary.
Croatia wants to allow the refugees to pass.
The Croatian Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "you can travel through, and we prepare ourselves for this possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who live and want to achieve something.
However, there are people who wanted to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country Croatia in the morning.
Most came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan, according to media reports.
They came by bus, as well as with taxis in the Serbian border town of SID.
Immediately after their arrival, they had tried to get to walk across the border to Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees may not encounter border fences.
For the border are other dangers: sharp mines of the Yugoslav civil war lie there in the 90s.
Deminers should quickly create a safe passage.
After Hungary, hardly more refugees come, however, after the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 apprehended people.
It had been just before gate closure on Monday still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify the overcoming and damage the security fence as a criminal offence.
Therefore 35 criminal proceedings have been initiated in the southern Hungarian city of Szeged.
Prison sentences threaten the person sentenced up to five years and deportation from the country.
We have 94 asylum applications according to the Immigration Department accepted on Tuesday in the "transit zones set up anew at the border" as a whole, almost all - 93 - at the main transition Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
Would have stayed there 40 refugees on Wednesday morning.
Virtually no one has however granted asylum a prospect in Hungary to get.
According to Hungarian, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers will be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
Röszke started workers to clean up.
They collected the garbage, the tens of thousands of people had left in the past few weeks on the roadside.
Shutter grid were broken down and one of the centres in the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to talk about the aim of this restructuring.
Only a few refugees reach Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
To 20,000 migrants were according to government figures, but still in the country.
In Salzburg, people wait around 1400 on the onward journey to Germany.
Train services from there to Germany was halted in the morning on statement of German authorities.
Regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot arrived in Freilassing.
Mayor was "Stranded" across the border
"We were busy with cleaning up after the Festival on Sunday, when there were suddenly ten people with suitcases at the entrance of the tent," as Wernsteins Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Because Germany but surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugees, was for them in Wernstein", as Stadler, who immediately offered to help and took the stranded along with two other helpers and their cars across the border in the near Passau.
Previously, we have available once the unexpected guests with snacks and drinks.
We just said we will take them by car to Passau.
"That was, of course, for us," says Stadler in the OÖN interview.
They were very grateful.
A man did it not take a generous donation to pass - 100 euros for the fire department.
"This has pleased us", said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers were converted on Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE in a regional train direction Passau, to it after the short term were carried out preaching, that rail traffic was discontinued after Germany to try still across the border.
The regional train was turned off but before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
A run of Zweibrücken married the Festival with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday social, day before sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
That Viktor Orbán sends more thousands to us, is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of in the camp Röszke immediately in the construction of structures to help, ensuring humanity, our Chancellor has officially and publicly put the attitude of the Hungarian Government in the atmosphere of national socialism.
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now facing in the border areas with chaotic conditions.
Also the refugees will have to determine that the "promised land", which has been invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the continuing flows of refugees and the onset of winter, to produce decent conditions for asylum seekers in us.
And it is an even bigger – peace, to maintain security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 Hardy quarters
Konrad has to do with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used that his word carries weight.
The Government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen bankers to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first reception centre Traiskirchen has already received Konrad in the handle.
"We have no homeless more in Traiskirchen," he said of his first success.
Also accommodation of 20,000 refugees of who had come to Austria on Monday, was is without fuss, Konrad said, and praised the "master achievement".
The Ministry of the Interior, however, spoke of a "crisis situation".
Overall, Konrad anticipates a requirement of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number 35,000 accommodations must be found in the next few weeks, 20,000 are to provide the countries, 15,000 of the Federal Government.
Should there be more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a black hole," said Konrad.
With the land captains, he has already held talks.
They would have assured him to create quarters for the refugees.
"It runs fine in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP agent supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, it should be clarified, as the Church will help.
The asylum Coordinator in the ORF action "Help as we" has great expectations.
Individuals can easily offer accommodations on the platform.
In addition it is hoped to hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In hard times, it could not be that accommodation providers must comply with a certain amount of the towel rail or size of skylights.
"Emergency standards" would have to apply for a limited period of time.
Konrad established that he was successful in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior in keeping with his experience.
I am an older gentleman, which they say the untruth in the face.
Power of persuasion was his main weapon.
Konrad and Maier cause the Republic no costs, as they themselves said.
They want to increase the number of their employees to three or four.
Own accommodation search was not successful yet.
Konrad wanted to put up a container at Stephansplatz as an Office.
But apparently there are problems with the approval.
Linz demands a better distribution
For the time being, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as you can currently accommodate people without these measures, says mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
For emergency, other locations on their suitability will be examined but.
The city chief at the Division of refugees within the State is critical.
Other districts have to make their contribution.
Seehofer: "borders are not closed"
In a long phone call with the Bavarian Minister-President Horst Seehofer (CSU), Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) has agreed the way forward on the refugee issue on Monday.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off.
The onward travel of refugees in the Federal Republic was still possible.
However, there are in just the appropriate border controls.
With refugees to Germany there will be for the time being no more special trains.
The people would associated, however, with regular trains to Germany.
Pühringer demanded even greater solidarity on the refugee issue from the other EU Member States.
"A logical consequence" from the approach of the Germans for Pühringer is also Austria's borders to introduce controls again.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The General renovation of the "shipyard" in the Linz industry line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of Office and production building S & T has moved the listed IT group, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented out to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the brilliant minds are our raw material - and we have to try that they work for us," says S & T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine to invest in startup companies the new shipyard and later also to acquire which.
From the beginning, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what is Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested in the location of S & T, 3.3 million euro from the Tech Center, which is part of the one-third of the city of Linz, the province of Upper Austria and the Association (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years of S & T and Tech Center.
30 percent of 2700 square meters area in the building are already rented, there are requests for another 40 percent.
Lia Peroni owner opened a second shop in the arcade
FURLA handbags at the Centre are in the new shop.
Actually Jutta Breit wanted to purchase a dog.
This project had to postpone the 49-year old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt arcade without further ADO: Finally it has grown now in the form of another business locomotive ales.
In the FURLA shop opposite the business she sold include bags, suitcases, shoes and garment manufacturers, all to the brand FURLA handbag now, purses are available for 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday is the new shop in operation.
Previously converted several weeks.
"I have but long considering whether I should open a shop," says broad.
It was decisive for the decision, among others, that also the FURLA producers who are at home in Bologna, were attracted by the idea of own location where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the area of Linz, who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who has own Italian roots.
Get your fashion interest has put wide by her mother in the cradle.
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Also the expert not with certainty why, some woman at the sight is a beautiful handbag in Rapture, can answer.
Perhaps it is because a nice bag adds value to any outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place where the residents are called show-offs.
This property combines some with the billionaire, who wants to become President.
Donald Trump (69) is good for excitement.
Whether he expressed xenophobic, male goes to journalists or revealed knowledge gaps in the international policy of the crisis – the candidates for the Office of the US President vigorously stirs up the election campaign.
And good cuts.
That is registered in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the real estate billionaire grandparents come from.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer hairstyle is a term for many in the wine-producing village on the wine route.
Some on-site 1200 inhabitants is over many corners with it is related.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt, Germany: Donald Trump, here in the campaign mode.
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do think the villagers about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
"I think the find this somehow exciting, are but not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter way", says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädterin has turned an amusing documentary about the village and its famous offspring, which trump even the ketchup-Heinz family counts.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, comes in "Kings of Kallstadt" to speak - so with the statement that he would be surely successful if he lived in Kallstadt (2014).
He has not placed it to the King of hearts.
Although there was respect for the achievements of the family, but also tend to be the thought that Trump was "already a bit of a big mouth", says Wendel.
Coincidentally the nickname noisy, the Kallstadt in the vicinity, "The Brulljesmacher" - to high German: she says the blowhard.
Trump is from the village of show-offs.
The Trump'sche success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold miners in the United States.
First land purchases in New York were a cornerstone of the real estate company.
But the lives of grandparents was not without tragedy: your desire to return permanently to the home, failed due to the Bavarian State, to which the Palatinate then belonged.
He had not included Trump because he was once left without permission, said the Director of the Institute of Palatinate history and folklore, Roland Paul, to the film's release.
Trump was the grandson of "illegal immigrant".
This is in contrast to the sometimes pithy statements of the descendants.
He had repeatedly disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"So as the rumbles, it is not so nice," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of trumps ("grandma was a born Trump, Grandpa was born Heinz").
The winemaker in retirement sees rather distant from the Americans, "he is always so short-tempered".
Does he believe that Trump come?
"I can not imagine that", says the 72.
"He never cared about Kallstadt".
The boarding house landlady Veronika Schramm as some Kallstadter mentioned that a descendant of the family Heinz when visiting donated something for the church organ, which was generally well received.
"I can not imagine that of the Donald" says the 68.
It would be better if he could not win the election, because "has such radical views, I don't know if that's good".
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the United States, would have been so like him, "he would have never reached".
"There are more interesting subjects than him," says Winemaker's daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My President is not Yes" she says.
And: "The grapes are ripe without the Trump of President of".
12 000 filmgoers have seen Wendel movie for the Trump was interviewed long, also in the United States, the interest awakened.
The upper Bavarian town is Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden Germany's first "mountain village".
From the hand of the Vice President at the German Alpine Club, Ludwig Eric kitten, the village of 1800 inhabitants in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award on Wednesday for sustainable tourism.
In Austria, there are already 20 "mountaineering villages".
The local Alpine Association for the award is responsible in the neighbouring country.
A "mountain village" may have no more than 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.

Today achieved a slight increase compared with the ratings for Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but his number was behind the last Thursday (343.000).

In August, today reached an average 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of sunrise.
At the beginning of the year was the distance between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is at average 349.000 spectators to 314.000 today.
This is the most interesting thing happens every morning.
The winds of change affect this morning people more than the Parliament.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the review!

The big news for seven the impressive debut of 800 words with the former star of series of packed to the rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson is a hit show solo without the rafters star Rebecca Gibney could carry.
The result of last night responded to this with a clear "Yes".
The X-factor of seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and beat the block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000) easily.
Seven had mixed results on night two of the Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) the new quiz show, O'Keefe hosted by Andrew revealed 446,000 viewers on average.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623.000 spectators – enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires hot seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of the Chase Australia reached 520,000 viewers and whopping in the second half hour 720,000.
Hot-seat average of 620,000.
The decrease in the odds of the second evening of the Chase Australia will give nine confidence that hot seat will eventually prevail at 17:30.
The Chase Australia minute which failed to outperform the McGuires show is a replacement for million dollars.

Secret unveiled?...
Lana Jeavons-fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Marko ski may unknowingly apparently have, whoever wins the Bachelor.
The woman at the Sam Wood in the Bachelor finally lands, was covered in the greatest secrecy.

Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have left out in lyrical terms is why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as the reasons, why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "if not you, who should receive Woods last rose?", could be their answers to the killjoy who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-fellows and Marko ski called both fast - besides himself - Mackay as the best partner for wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had with each other from the first day to a simple relationship.
"From the moment I walked into the House and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energies, as I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that in the entire course of the show," said Jeavons-fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on the Earth, it is so much fun to be with her," Marko ski added.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
You feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From their point of view Mackay said that the home visit last week her clear made that that wood could be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not only a game - I'm now fully set on him," she said.
And when she was asked, who wood should if not choose it, because it was puzzling.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the leftover girls alike - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 19:30, on ten.
Originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there are many other teams that last year requests sent after his impressive open training day end.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game on the bench, when he so lost a tussle, the Aussie Rugby League convert did with his first punt-return on Tuesday when the 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula entrusted his man and the next opportunity for a punt return and the running game gave Hayne after injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show its true face in the locker room after the game.
Rather than to grind his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49ers sports reporter cam Inman reported that Hayne was encouraged by special teams Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his botched catch and to take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne messes with a punt, which was restored in the first quarter of the game of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start, Hayne and his massive Australian following for his NFL debut had hoped for.
Hayne left the field of play after the fumble cursing and told the Australian radio later duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could imagine a worse start in his NFL career.
"That was a thing that happens now, they only care of the next game, and this is it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Carver with his origin debut back in 2007, when a pass with led to a try for Queensland in his own in-goal area.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27 years yet.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and keeping an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.

The free voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party and leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn exam in Grosswallstadt facing a severe crisis in Bavaria's schools, if there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to prevent the collapse of the schools," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise, we will have distortions in the Bavarian educational system."
The parliamentary group of the free voters will meet until Friday in the lower franconian town of the municipality.
Actually, other main topics were provided.
But the record number of refugees dominated also the free voters meeting.
"Of course the issue of asylum will overlay the exam", said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, just as there was it during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"It cannot go on, we need to address the causes," said head of free voters.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport as soon as possible to the free voters.
For this reason, Aiwanger demanded more staff for the administrative courts, which are responsible for asylum claims: "We need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW boss criticised the fact that several States are not consistent: "We need a nationwide uniform standards in the States."
"Bayern deporting, others are not."
"As we need to be effective."
However, should the land policy in Grosswallstadt do not fall under the table.
A long time burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, education minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 high schools has the pilot "intermediate plus" started, in which tested an extension of the upper intermediate level from three to four years - as a result, it takes again nine years until graduation.
However, this does not go far enough Aiwanger.
"The theme of G9 must be accelerated," said the head of FW.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want to.
Free ride on the G9 everywhere where it is desired.

Google Inc (GOOGL. O) a doubling donations campaign announced that the 11 million $ to muster for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European Nations as they flee from the war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on his blog.
Rather than a Manager make the announcement, wrote Rita Masoud, a Google employee who has fled from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, about their personal experiences.

I was lucky.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert of weight loss surgery, wrote of an editorial to the new study in JAMA surgery.
Weight loss surgery or weight loss surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 is considered to be obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng used general hospital data that they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare these two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI for those receiving non-surgical treatments of diabetes about the same at 29 remained.
Among those undergoing a surgical procedure, the diabetes disease broke up completely and 28% partly at 36%.
In the medical treatment group diabetes fully only at one percent, and with only about two percent was in comparison.
In addition, the results in the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "Generally better in the 'surgical' group", found the authors.
The researchers monitored also the patients blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c the best below 7 percent is held, write the researchers.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased level of around 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
In the medical therapy group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" – as the improved hemoglobin A1c level is reflected in you - not the mortality was reduced in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team compared the average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group compared to the Gastrectomy Group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), reached larger declines in the BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and rather a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden, that operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was in obese people who underwent obesity surgery likely to die about 29 percent - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods in the course of 15 years.
Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival in surgery patients, said Blackstone, it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin seriously to take weight, as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think that we can wait too long until we encourage people to take this seriously," she said.
"I think that as soon as they have accumulated genetic changes, which have tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard."

"It is impossible that everyone in Europe can come" - Dalai Lama - RT-news
Europe could absorb not all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the countries of origin of refugees.
The Dalai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis to start his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for compassion in Oxford on, dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that the interests of humanity before the interests of individual Nations or even continents should be placed under the circumstances.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis, although admirable, but was not appropriate to the situation.
"It is impossible that everyone in Europe can come," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of in Germany and Austria praised efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
He stressed "to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, a true peace and authentic development, can be made mainly through education for these Muslim countries,".
Ultimately, we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
"The application has never solved these problems of violence", he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush's action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States moved a chain of uncontrollable events to.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and this has caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-time increase in intake of disinfectant by children in last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 who swallow strongly alcoholic disinfectant, so the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, increased the cases of revenue of hand Sanitizer for children under 12 years, poison control centers report, 3,266 in 2010 on 16.117 in 2014.
"Children are the increase in these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drinking disinfectant, while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a dare in social media.
YouTube videos show how young people drinking disinfectant only because a cheap experience.
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectant with benzene mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be lured by attractive aromas of disinfectant.
"A child doesn't think that this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectant) are those that are scented.
There are disinfectant with Strawberry, grape and orange scent, which are very appealing for children.
Disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Particularly in young children, a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, Medical Director of the poison emergency call center at the Hospital of the University of Kansas, the Fox 4 in Kansa city.
So, you would leave no SIP whisky standing around, but people let this hand disinfectant within reach of children, and when children come in, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year girl who recently had taken four splashes of after Strawberry scented disinfectant in the school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold, which applies in an adult by law as a drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated them at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah slurred her words and was not able to go, when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate hospital for children for signs of brain injury, because it had fallen girls by alcohol and himself had bumped his head, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, CNN.
It could be fatal for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and store disinfectants out of reach of the child.
About alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants with deaths were connected.
In the year 2013, two women in Ontario died women after swallowing of hand disinfectant, which contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January three students in the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison her "mean" teacher, by they interpreted antibacterial products for the classroom", as it reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to disinfectants and banished her from her room.
The police saw the foiled plan as "Chatter" and referred to disciplinary action to the School Board.

Why I will be witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Something later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will to see how a man is put to death.
When it happens, and I hope that it does not happen, I will sit in a spectator Gallery in the death Chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was already for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day neared, I began to fear me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and as more applications than places available, a macabre Lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Who is selected, which will monitor it emotionless.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossips close friend, with whom I developed my own relationship in the months with phone calls and a visit to two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh often much when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I may be not a witness and a journalist, so it will be me not allowed to bring a notebook and a pen, to record what I see.
I must just try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, to give up my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants it, and get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "would have to put better it", but she still thinks that it is wrong, what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he would do it.
I told him that he can at any time remove me from his list of witnesses.
But he wants that an international reporter is present there to write.
When he dies, he thinks that the publicity will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim portraits ware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you hear the series of podcasts that I made.
I will not turn on all the details.
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions would make him guilty for the murder of Barry Van Treese to be a beneficiary of the Act.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is guilty not of murder.
I sure think that there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters, which you can use for this.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to wet Police Chase to come from the canning River
The canning Vale policeman stayed dry, when he persuaded the man, of the canning River.
A man of Perth, an attempt to hang out with the police, was unsuccessful, as he was in the shallow and swampy water, located just a few metres from a police officer who tried "gently to persuade him to return to the shore."
The police of canning Vale was launched on Tuesday to a trespassing incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape in the direction of the canning River.
But he was not too far.
"He stood in the water and said ' I can't get out, come and get me", said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too thrilled to make his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good COP negotiated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape", said Senior Sergeant Castledine.

Peter Moody claims that stewards were trying to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody claims that by Racing Victoria stewards have tried in the last year a spy in his stables to install and threatened to quit the race.
He took aim at the stewards and the Health Department of Racing Victoria, claiming that scratching of Lady Tatai for Raceday treatment, the last straw on Wednesday, carrying out a personal campaign against him with the late.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he himself have found even under difficult conditions, when it came to the positive cobalt swab sample at lid ARIS, he cannot explain.
He had held back 18 months because of the spying allegations and did not want that it "look like too high hanging grapes."
"I planned to say anything about it, and I sat long on it, but sometimes they are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know that it went on.
Sometimes, reaction and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will now go home evening and sleep well.
I would like to go around heads, and I want my owners to think that I will try my best for them.
When you start to think, I do not, I should be no more trainers.
I must then consider what I do with my license.
Before Moody had let go off the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the Health Department had tried to spy on his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, sat in a room with a man - whom I'll call when asked - Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I do in my stables," Moody said at Racing.com.
Apparently, you believe that I am a cheater.
If that's the case, they should consider themselves certainly on their noses, because they have failed while trying to be brief.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Should that bring me to the view that it's personal?
The RVL has behaved cowardly and responsible people may make outside of coaches, what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
I am so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think that I am.
Maybe you must take me my license to offend me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now think they can be.
But I am now arrived at the point where it doesn't matter for me, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration levels of trainers have built up with the long-running investigation of cobalt at Lidari, and the late scratching led that he said that he "could throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the undefeated master Black Caviar, described the competition treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for it", he said.
"One of my employees has applied erroneously mud on the leg.
It could have been last night so.
It could have been all day yesterday so what was the case.
It was so on race day.
Moody could be an investigation into this matter with a three-month disqualification for the treatment facing Pack on race day be. was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules, know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that we need rules, but here it has gone too far," Moody said.

Melbourne storm Coach Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals because of allegations to wrestling
Melbourne storm Coach Craig Bellamy has referred to as "Agenda-Setting" criticism of the tackling of Player favorites of the NRL by two Premier League.
Sydney roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees have allowed "Wrestling" the storm players with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly-veiled remark to the storm team, his team reached the final victory against the North Queensland cowboys on Saturday night had. He called the game a "perfect example" of Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said that they were focused only on their "contact us" at the tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team confident voice him because it meant that they were worried to be beaten by the storm team.
On Wednesday, "that appears again and again - I haven't heard that Trent spoke Robinson about wrestling matches when they beat us 2-24," said Bellamy.
I can guarantee that we changed have. but nothing on our defensive system or the techniques in the whole year in the last six weeks, we have made our contact in tackles a real priority, and which has yielded the turnaround for us.
Trent has been there three years, and he obviously has a great team to train he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing, so was it a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this keeps popping up at this time of year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of the "exciting football" and his mentor recalled that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
"He has his game on Friday night compared with our on Saturday night and their game was exciting", Bellamy said.
I remember that in the year 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he will take a shit about.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially its young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have these kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all of his kind of football to play - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.
I build confidence, because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago they have not thought to us when it comes to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game storm against the roosters scored a higher score than the Broncos game against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I have not seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is an exciting game?
Or breaks make and no points something exciting?
The game plans are for me.
If you mention us, it means that we will meet in a period still on it.
The storm team has free this weekend, as they have won the right, either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla sharks next Saturday night in the preliminary final at AAMI Park to receive the ticket sales starts from next Tuesday morning.

The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police cared and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered "concerned" Web searches, the terms for the search for indecent pictures of children used.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it, because it then "pretended to"Paedophiles on the Internet would lead"and he a policeman to be to scare them".
The Prosecutor, Eilidh Robertson said the Dundee Sheriff Court: "he said that it was an addiction, that he was addicted to scare people."
He admitted that were carried out the searches on the computer from it, but said it had happened because he wanted to consider a police officer to be to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his discussions with the unknown person, who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more pictures.
He said that he did it to lure them.
He said he was sick in the head, when he's drinking, and said he wants to see pictures of raping and murder then.
Ms Robertson added: "when the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She saw then the indecent pictures on the phone and thus confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used computer and PlayStation to talk with girls, who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the indictment to have taken indecent images of children on June 14 last year, to have failed to meet the conditions on 25 January this year and to have appeared not to court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg does not appear in the register of sexual offenders, since it could be argued that there was "no significant sexual element" in his offense to find.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to obtain background reports about social work.
Hogg bail was granted in this case, but was kept due to consultations on other pending cases in pre-trial detention.
It was recorded before the date of the judgment in the register of sexual offenders.

JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meter cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has been quite Tegel an ex-inmate of prison, which for months was housed in a small cell.
Due to the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are entitled to financial compensation in principle if they are housed in small cells.
The Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday has decided.
The people concerned can the judges according to even money hope, if they were only a few days in the narrow spaces (file No.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was housed in the prison of Berlin-Tegel Airport between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space; the toilet was not spatially separated.
Then, the man who is now back at large according to his lawyer had been moved to a larger cell.
Although his official liability proceedings of the degrading conditions of detention against the State of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Court reversed the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re-examination there.
You can see the human dignity of the man injured.
Supreme Court decides on the amount of compensation
Detention days for compensation are decisive of the period in question for legal reasons only a few days, a claim for compensation is given, it said.
Otherwise, it would be "a decline of legal protection of personality to fear".
The Supreme Court must now clarify the amount of monetary compensation.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they spoke to only damages a prisoner in April because he was naked in a cell.
Also the multiple occupancy of a cell without toilet is a decision of 2011 according to unworthy of man.
Karlsruhe, also confirmed the Berlin court, which had certified an inhumane accommodation in November 2009 an inmate in a Parallelfall in addition, on Wednesday.
The former plaintiff was over three months every day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell housed in the Karlsruhe event.
The Berlin prisons had come in the last few weeks due to lack of personnel in the headlines.
Prisoners be included therefore repeatedly 23 hours, increases the aggressiveness, it should have come to brawls, already due to the tense situation.
According to the Justizpressestelle, 21 positions in Tegel due to lack of offspring are not filled, 19 are to be cut in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "we do it"
The influx of refugees is an enormous challenge – the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What to expect in Germany?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will be according to projections of the Federal Ministry of the Interior in Germany this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is Germany able to absorb one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination given the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we can do it".
The following overview provides what to expect Germany.
Apartments are needed according to different forecasts between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of construction) and 400000 (estimate of Pestel Institute) per year - and the next five years.
That's almost twice as much, built as before (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing in affordable rental properties is dramatic: every year 60000 to 80000 social housing from the rent controls fall out, and these discounted apartments will apply for refugees.
Therefore, Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the promotion, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
Is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing units per year would have to emerge and that the Federal Government would have to invest funding amounting to 6.4 billion a year.
Scientists and federal Bauministerin agree, that there should be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to the Institute for labour market and occupational research, it is assumed that 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be gainfully employed in the long term.
However, the refugees would not systematically criticized asked in Germany after their qualifications to help them get started, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees is vital if they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, there has been a change in policy according to Thränhardt: from the work ban for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was a work ban on asylum seekers of up to five years, this was limited, in November 2014 to three months as well as the residence requirement, asylum seekers on a place of residence.
The view has prevailed in society - also due to the lack of skilled workers - the majority, that faster access to the labour market should enable refugees.
Lack knowledge of German is a major barrier to access to the labour market.
So far, there is no sufficient offer of General and professional language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts.
Networking is the best way to work integration according to Thränhardt.
The Berlin school administration has determined that only a few refugees parents give their children in the day-care centres, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the rootless parents, it is only once very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the daycare center, the Administration distributed handouts in different languages.
Should the need for teachers by the large number of refugees to rise, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - about, by allowing more technical schools.
In the countries, students without knowledge of German in welcome classes are prepared for teaching.
You are taught but not always by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also of teachers, who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
Them there is no lack of, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration.
The German Student Association estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no State prohibits the study of asylum seekers or tolerated - Berlin was the only exception so far, Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) but gave up his stance.
Access to the University could be facilitated study willing refugees.
For refugees with a residence permit or condoning get no benefits according to the laws, when they start studying.
The latter have basically no student loans, as they fall outside the circle of bafögberechtigten persons.
Tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany in order to be eligible for student loans, so far four years from January 1, 2016 shortened to this margin to 15 months.
This funding gap must be closed but, call noise, Berlin's State Secretary for science, and the German Studentenwerk Steffen.
Students should immediately get student loans.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should gradually the same rights give Islam as they have the churches, and further develop the existing State Church law to a new state religions ratio.
The establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association, who take professional care of the newcomers would be important.
The rights include responsibilities.
Must agree the representatives of Islam on a clear point of contact and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and to give him some control.
This includes the willingness to act boldly against religious fundamentalism.
The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday, religious conflict could be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have forfeited immediately their right to stay, here in Germany," he said in the Bayerischer Rundfunk.
He proposed to translate the basic law in Arabic.
Integration will in the future much more than today to be a theme of the society as a whole.
This is also the majority society must change, the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing.
Although Germany has - as a result of European decisions – for a decade on a tight a federal agency and a general equality law.
But as the NSU murders showed in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive learns very slowly.
Equal opportunities for all: what migrant organisations and the non-white German interest groups long demand and why international agreements such as the Convention against racism oblige Germany, must become a reality in the next few years, when the country remain peaceful and its new citizens to use their facilities for the benefit of all.
In General, Germany is able to provide the previously expected refugees, medical doctor President Frank Ulrich Montgomery said.
"We create with regard to man power and capacity,", he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money into the system must flow for it.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls immediately upon registration health cards to hand over all comers.
Services could be charged later with the Federal States.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited range of services, which provides the laws.
Otherwise, above all the language barriers to make the doctors.
Already, so the Berlin health scientist has demonstrated Thea Borde, migrants are worse about their illnesses enlightened than other patients.
Not only in hospitals, including medical practices interpreter costs would have to be taken over, it demands.
Many refugees already with more general focal points in the emergency care would help.
And with another diagnostic view.
There's significantly more untreated disability among refugee children about, and young people is about HIV education.
German doctors from their training would be clear but with different syndromes, says Montgomery.
"Parasites or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect". and with regard to the shortage of doctors, whether the refugees even relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualification however, and may again take examinations.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is mentally ill according to the Federal Chamber of psychotherapist (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK explains refugee children, are particularly vulnerable.
A recent study at the TU Munich proves that five Syrian refugee children traumatized is on in Germany.
Who is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, among other things, suffers from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart palpitations, and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe irritability and emotional numbness.
Early treatment is necessary, to prevent that the symptoms were chronic, Munz said.
So far, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services may submit a request for psychotherapy, but does it take for several months to the process.
Also mostly officers or doctors who are not trained for the mental illness, would decide in the social services, whether or not treatment is necessary.
This would often lead to misjudgments, says Munz.

Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs earlier this year from a podium.
He was uninjured, but the video of the case spread quickly through social media.
The opening of Parliament was marred by allegations of the opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats, and they were warned not to accompany the speech of Mr Mugabe with booing.
In the past month they had booed him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the nation in Parliament – this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman of the movement for democratic change (movement for democratic change - MDC) innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians have receive text messages on their cell phones, warned Mr. to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number that does not appear, but it has the title of 'Death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
She will warn the concerned members of Parliament that ends the immunity in the Parliament, and as soon as they leave the Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the threats to the politicians.

FC arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must be ahead of the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger compared Wilshere to stressed that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England, and given its history, its participation is still uncertain in the next summer at the European Championships.
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere after a separate ankle injury had finished last season strongly, and then back to his old swing had returned during the previous season.
"This kind of injury threatened not the career," Wenger said.
It is a bone that is not well healed.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was in conjunction with his ankles or the injuries that he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical standpoint, but as Wenger also recognized, there are the associated risk of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It developed also an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier injuries Ltd has 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 League games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for arsenal is that they Premier were League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007/08 of one of the two, which have recorded the most days of the injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but arsenal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time in which you strengthen your body and have to win power", said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body is stabilized, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career out of the way he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are expected to start.
Wenger can begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and to treat those who need it, a small breather," Wenger said.
Although arsenal are favourites to progress from Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is undefeated after 41 games, after the "Invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was hit by an earthquake, which measured 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope to lead the Club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never worked for arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm long enough in business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show which gives us serious lessons about male
The absence of similar appearances in shows is obvious, especially in noting how the need for men to open up, has become now more desperate than ever, how to prove suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, the campaign against living miserably (CALM - campaign against a pitiful life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim to put culture in question prevents the men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart in the fight to address this challenge.
A recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends cut in half the risk of mental health problems.
But of course you must first of all have friends make a friendship work.
In the age of communication through social media, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, cheerful and successful, although in reality dominated the isolation.
This superficial success is dominated by the, what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper effect on our mental health.
And a video game inventor and billionaire recently said that money can't buy really good luck.
The nice thing about friends was that this focus on the head was placed.
Each character is defined by his work, but because of his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of football watching in comfortable armchairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came from knowing that men may relate to in any case, to explore their feelings even if they often hold back completely.
As an employee of the telephone emergency service explained it to me:... "my listener role for people who feel depressed and suicidal, really clearly showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying "I get along this" has a tremendous effect, such as the fact that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows of that comes to my mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of male.
So my objective outsider status over the phone also may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, when you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest with the scenery completely redesigned to celebrate this weekend, then why take your friends for a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see sitting around someone alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference could make your friendship.
Friends will be sent on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria will meet to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates after his goal against Malmö with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson CAVANI.
Di Maria meets on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and PSG helps to pass on Malmö.
Here are the report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson CAVANI held course, as Paris Saint-Germain its Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö in the Parc des Princes Stadium started on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French champions on the way, but then they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when CAVANI scored a header in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs as they strive not only qualifying for the knockout rounds, a strong start against the Swedish master, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blanc team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances before the goal he was later in the game against his hometown team and the Club, with whom he already began his illustrious career in 1999, replaced.
"It's not easy, at home or abroad in the Champions League to win. so it is a good start to win 2-0, to cause problems for our opponents and relaxed look back, even though there are certain things that we still need to perfect in the course of the season," Blanc said.
"That's a good sign.
"We wanted to win and we have won, although I regret that we do not have scored one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team held a 2-2 draw on its own course against Bordeaux in the first division at the weekend, but he was cut out by di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was known as the man can take the PSG to the next level in Europe, when he in the last month from Manchester United was taken over, and he hinted why, when he in Marco Verrattis pass behind the Malmo defense ran into it before finishing at Johan Wiland along nicely in the corner of the net.
If, however, someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, was disappointed.
Malmö, which beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, participated in Anpiff with nine players on the field and was a difficult opponent lined up with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield.
But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, Trapps post passed to Kevin in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead PSG was on himself sometimes, with some wayward and bad accounts, not least by Ibrahimovic which Championship no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after CAVANI had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless he proved much more skill, when he brought his team-mates into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, the Di Maria is transformed into a ball, which past directed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post...
The second goal was finally shortly after the hour mark thanks to CAVANI. the Uruguayans scored his sixth goal of the season so, after Ibrahimovic had fished on a left flank of Maxwell.
That ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only excellent intervention of Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz, could keep the end result, before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was stripped of a gate at the end.
The coach of Malmö, age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegians said: "our last Champions League was game in December last year.
Since then, we have played only in the Swedish League, which has the same level of.
The qualifiers are not sufficient".
Hats off to Paris!

The competition show, which completed its 7th season, had never seen a competition participant, was able to complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten made it to the final.
A 75-foot-long rope climbing was one of the last task in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within the time, he was the first athlete who finished the strenuous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior completed. However, Caldiero this challenge full three seconds faster, what the winner made him.
Caldiero talked to E! news after the hard-fought victory, still reeling from the shock of winning the Grand Prize of 1 million $.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I have never more than $10,000 earned or had to life", Isaac said E! over his pile of money.
So all of a sudden... as I can not even imagine, how that is... the future is unknown.
Senior producer Kent Weed sat down reporters with the Hollywood, to discuss the final and why Britten, although he finished first at all the course, is not just any prize money.
The money the fastest person goes to according to the rules.
"If there is more than one finalist who gets it with the fastest time", said weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he receives the great bonus.
I don't think that he has any resentment about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
Masses of awards he received from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad that it is Isaac."
And I think that Isaac would have felt as if they had reversed the roles.
America Ninja warrior was renewed for an eighth season, filming will begin in the spring of 2016.

Rome now has a Martin-Luther-Platz
Almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless place in the Park on Oppio Hill on the name of the German reformer was christened on Wednesday.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero", he is now recognized as "German theologian of the Reformation".
The Park is right next to the Colosseum in ancient Rome.
The name had been requested by the Association of Evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled Wednesday because the Protestants in the city of the Popes over the centuries as a minority only in secret to be able to live their faith.
With the square will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome would be welcomed.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was 1510/11 a few months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year.

Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) the Crown of thorns is one of the major works, painted by Otmar Alt for his Bible.
Klaus senior post has written the introduction and updated texts of the Bible.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar ALT Bible, which now appeared with splendid images.
In the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who has formulated his own interpretations of Biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 subjects.
The 75-year old has received his "language" with bright colours and imaginative shapes - which is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: the respective topics adapted can have a quite quite bleak.
Three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the "book of all books".
Cycles, which are dedicated to topics such as the way of the cross, plagues, bids, or Lord's prayer were created.
Thus he has fascinated spontaneously several partners: This applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as for the Kettler Verlag with its focus on art books.
And especially the author Klaus senior post, which dealt with the respective places of the Bible based on the painting.
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and so today, in the current context "translated into".
These texts are like verbal mirror of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and each set of the artist of who formulated his own personal thoughts on the situation here.
The cover of jewelry has golden letters.
Thus the 75th allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions double.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately ever trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in New York City born and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Moravian Church order.
"As the education happened already with the cane", recalls Otmar Alt.
"I've tried to work this might again get me along with the father".
His second concern was to restore the art to more important in fast-moving time: "the perception of imagery is today characterized by advertising, and is noisy.
Symbolism is as displaced.
Artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things.
Images have always something mysterious and not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants to, discover that the viewer into the pictures "fall into", they let on, and feel what power they have: "The image is looking his counterpart".
Klaus senior post admitted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar ALT Bible in the Otmar ALT Foundation, "has always been" a lover of Otmar ALTs art to have been: "I like how he sees life with his paintings".
Old did not care fully to capture the Bible, but important, even mysterious themes selected for him.
Alte post "That was no cooperation at eye level," says: "this is the images, the text explains only". a picture Bible was created.
For Hans Möhler by Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation "to deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar ALTs images speak the (Biblical) language of love as well as the responsibility for Möhler.
A part of the original paper and canvas images - will be presented in an exhibition, which opens on November 15 in the Otmar ALT Foundation.

In this and the next year, the Association together with the DFB-selection and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 EUR for the integration of refugees.

That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trained on an absolute top level", the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller is used in all Europe League games in the future, Tuchel, however, left open.
Most likely, he will ride also the second game.
The brash statement of teammate of reus, that the final indent for Dortmund in the Europa League must be the goal, holding midfielder Julian Weigl can understand: "Thus Marco so wrong is."

Robot cars: Government will lead for Germany
Germany should be according to the will of the Federal Government in the change of the car of technology pioneer.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides for investment in digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA auto show of a "new age of mobility".
Automated and networked driving will improve road safety and congestion, said Dobrindt.
He wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, which come together with representatives of the industry at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of transport stresses the importance of the mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
A test track on the Highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being built for the testing of new technology.
So that the driver "no additional liability risks imposed be", wants the Federal Government the legal framework "review and, where necessary, adapt to new developments".
So Germany will advocate as internationally, increase the speed limit for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km/h.
The Federal Government wants to support also a change of the Vienna Convention, which provides for only the people as a driver.
When automated driving the car takes the lead in increasing, more and more the driver to the passenger.
The technology is based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of economy, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads were "until well after 2020 to be expected".
The authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros will appreciate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location Germany.
"Can the digital networking of the car to the increased safety and efficiency in road transport lead", the transport politician Sören Bartol said.
The issue of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly understood.
Still, the Germans see self-driving cars sceptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey presented on Wednesday to the AA of the Forsa Institute on behalf of the DEKRA testing organisation comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars over the next ten years will prevail, 32 percent believe only in 20 years, 31 percent believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect 33 percent by 2025 with self-driving cars in the United States.
Anyway, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-propelled vehicle.
According to a survey of the digital Association BITKOM, only seven percent would agree to relinquish control during the entire journey on all roads.
On the Highway 15 percent could imagine in traffic anyway, in a traffic jam 45 percent.
Every fourth car would leave control under any circumstances.

Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of great fashion show and a waxworks horror: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) on Wednesday in Munich an exhibition of his work presented.
The highlights: mannequins, which look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
You wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, which among other things, with Madonna's stage outfits to the big star who became fashion scene – and that he put men in skirts.
"I can no longer say that I'm terrible of Haute Couture the enfant because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, it's real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (from the sidewalk to the catwalk), which is from the 18th September at the Kunsthalle of the hypo Cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed its initial opposition to a show about his person.
He was actually against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
If you die, you get into the Museum.
The impressive collection had made previously in Montreal, Canada and Paris station.
"It's so much more than just nice clothes," said the Director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight in the work of the man of who has made fashion history, without ever having completed training to overlooking.
Chronologically, the show is not established, but it is a perfectly choreographed piece of art for much effort: to style the dolls, a stylist was hired for specially.
According to the curator Loriot of maxim of Thierry, 14 tons of material have carted the makers to Munich.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest was still a special treat: a leather trousers outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He interested himself for strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Horse animal's old Teddy can be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the first, tentative fashionable steps of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and poor in football) he attracted bras and dresses his teddy, Gaultier said.
His parents were not allowed to play with a doll.
He taught later even the design of fashion itself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier in Munich.
Later I bought the but of course.
For his first own fashion show, he did not pay the models.
They got nothing, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauen lace as a fashion niche
Earlier it wanted on the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen to meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were built in large quantities for customers who processed it to blankets and curtains.
That alone no longer, explained Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the fashion tip of Plauen.
Instead, the fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauen lace fashion played a major role, was then replaced by the home textile industry - and now is being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt cited some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
Even the so-called vintage clothing, similar to past eras, make a growing job potential.
Who uses any niches in the textile industry in Germany, is no longer on the market.
With us they account for half of all orders.
Fashion tip Plauen along with nine other companies is a member of the industry association of Plauen lace and embroidery.
They may carry the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales were broken off.
There are almost no longer private shops and also wholesale.
Our products reach the customer in this way hardly.
The mass-produced will today much more cheaply produced in Asia and sold almost exclusively through chains.
Also schwächle the export, currently in the United States and Russia.
Plenty of reasons for new ways.
Industry Association tries to score as Cordula Bauer of the embroidery bead in Falkenstein explained through environmental awareness: "Since this year, we have a quality seal, which shows that we produce ecologically and socially acceptable".
Reinhardt added: "This refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch of the Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of applied arts - and is specialized in embroidery and lace.
To counter the competition from Asia, we must find high-quality and innovative products.
That takes time and courage.
"There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies need to think above all, economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design will often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
In doing so, the machine in some places embroiders small beads.
The Plauener goldsmiths champion Bianca Hall Bach Krauße was inspired: "Before I could do anything with traditional Plauen lace".
Now use the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In a complex procedure, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Plauen lace - young and old", says Reuter.
It provides in the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose driving out in Plauen and the surrounding area have lived and who want a souvenir.
So I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of Plauen lace.

EU wants to double mercury limit in predators
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and the consumers expect a much higher dose of the case.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which there is a corresponding working document of the EU, sharply criticized the plans: "risks and side effects of misguided industrial policy and environmental policy are passed on with full force on pregnant women and young children", explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
Wolfschmidt according to the limits of the nerve for big fish should be raised at the end of the food chain like about shark or swordfish for "economic reasons" of one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
Large predatory fish are contaminated with mercury that 50 percent of catches cannot be sold on the basis of the force limits about but already today as strong.
After doubling the limit values, then only 14.5 percent were not for sale.
In return for this relaxation of the EU according to Foodwatch wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch called this but "Trick", because smaller coarse, like about carp usually as low charged, that they already comply with the planned maximum levels.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion, that alone helps the economy", said Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a highly toxic for the human heavy metal which greatly accumulates through the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
Therefore the Federal Government warns that "even small amounts especially in unborn damage of the nervous system" can cause.
The Federal Environment Ministry declared on its website in terms of the existing maximum levels, but that a "health threat to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury passes mainly through the coal combustion in the environment.
The German coal-fired plants bear buck more than six tons emit mercury according to a written report of the Federal Ministry of environment to the Green Member of Parliament Anna Lena in the year, two-thirds of the total emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish around in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube is "permanent and nationwide exceeded", had quoted in the March from the paper "The mirror".
Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
