The UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that there is "no military solution" to the conflict that has lasted almost five years and several weapons would only escalate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council to unite and support the negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday at a news conference that he plans to meet this month with the foreign ministers of the five permanent countries present in the council - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this situation intractable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures in the polls showing that Donald Trump has a real chance
Some have tried to label him as a "flip-flop."
Others have called him a joke.
Others waiting for the implosion.
But regardless of how some republicans are trying to tear down on Donald Trump in the top of the polls, did not (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads with a double-digit percentage and some are starting to wonder seriously what does this mean for the real estate mogul's nomination chances.
Of course, it is still premature.
None of this says that Trump will win the race for the nomination of the Republicans.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advancement it was Herman Cain's place in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And why would fight hard in the general elections are legion.
But outside groups such as the Super CAP of Jeb Bush and economic conservative group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and begin to support it with money.
Next we present a few figures in recent polls that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just something fleeting:
The figures indicating support Trump returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump to announce his candidacy, in mid-June, a poll by Monmouth University shows that only two out of 10 republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage climbed to 40%.
In early August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 republicans have a positive opinion about Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative view.
These figures remain.
A poll last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa found that 60% of the region's Republicans have a favorable opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump would win the race for the nomination.
In a poll conducted last week by CNN / ORC, 67% of republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "pleased" if Trump would win the race for the nomination.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if Trump would win the race for the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm that Trump (43% say they would be "thrilled" with 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
The other side, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush is the favorite to win the race for the nomination.
Most Republicans do not believe Trump's temperament is a problem.
While Donald Trump has been heavily criticised for the insults and his bombast, 52% of Republican voters nationally believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to the poll conducted Monday by ABC News / Washington Post.
Regasim same figures in the state of Iowa, where all 52% of republicans believe that Trump has the right personality to be leader, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% believe that it does not have the personality needed to act effectively and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament has no place in the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When you take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters believe Trump is genuine.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN / ORC, the question of who is most likely to win the race for the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed towards the end of July, when four out of 10 would be bet on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, the GOP voters have not read very well the future.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 republicans have elected Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the most plausible GOP voters believe Trump's campaign.
Even if Republicans or repliat toward another candidate. Trump still tops the all.
Some say that the split is likely to help Trump's victory, while supporting against Trump will share in more than a dozen candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by Monmouth University shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always receive majority support.
Trump is at a distance of 13 points by Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio's 14 points, 15 points from Walker, on 19 points of Jeb Bush and, finally, at 33 points apiece from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It is almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beat?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation one to one.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they have been decided.
A new poll released Tuesday by CBS / NYT shows that more than half of voters who support the Trump says it does not change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this and no one can say that they will never change.
46% say the loophole leaves open the possibility to change the option.
However, the most important opponent of Trump's is currently neurochirurgul Ben Carson, but is twice as likely voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 republicans say I agree with Trump in the immigration issue.
When Donald Trump calling Mexican immigrants "rapists" in the opening speech of his campaign, two months ago, immigration was the central issue in the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombast would lead to a split between senior hispanici voters and the Republican Party and will harm the rebranding efforts.
But, according to the poll conducted Monday by ABC / Post, six out of 10 say the republicans agree with Trump in the immigration issue.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, as will remain and Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities reach new culmi.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their status of outsideri.
According to the poll conducted Monday by ABC / Post, six out of 10 republicans say they prefer a political outsider at the expense of someone with experience in government.
The people are also angry with Washington.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg shows that three out of four republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of Republicans in congress, 54% saying he is "frustrated" and 21% "nervous at culme."
Jeremy Corbyn is making debut at the Prime Minister's questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn at PMQs debut was the long-awaited
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will make their debut later in Prime Minister's questions, faced for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of six questions about who has the right shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be looked at closely by the media and Labour MPs.
The weekly aparitiilor, he called for "less theatrical and more facts."
He also said that he can give up a few deployments and succumb to his colleagues.
Confrontation will be the first test of Mr Corbyn MP in the leading position, coming after he called a "shadow cabinet" and after the speech he delivered Tuesday at the TUC annual congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to keep silent on rostirea national anthem during a service held Tuesday with the anniversary of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England has drawn criticism from some conservative lawmakers and made headlines.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted
A spokesperson for Mr Corbyn said he "respectfully silent" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Forces in the Battle of England."
But a member of the shadow cabinet of Mr Corbyn, Owen Smith, told the Two's Newsnight by the BBC that he had recommended the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around a dozen shadow cabinet ministers have refused to be part of the leadership team of Mr Corbyn, arguing with the differences of opinion about the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party backed him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, says political differences are "total" in the Labour Party after the appointment of Mr Corbyn on his position on the European Union and limit benefits.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party will bring changes that will eliminate the whole idea of limiting.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labor and Pension, said the party is "very clear" in the sole opposition to the government's plans to reduce the "head" of the 26,000 pounds mounted on pounds.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader facing David Cameron at the rostrum in the last decade, when he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from external sources" for questions to ask God Cameron and received more than 30,000 suggestions.
Islington North MP said PMQs implies a level of confrontation is too high and that it will refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take place at PMQs when he can't attend - for example when Mr Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that will allow others to speak occasionally, saying that he approached the Chamber of Deputies Speaker, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over the leadership, Mr Cameron said he wants to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he failed in his approach.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs was considered a key barometer of the reasoning of a leader, the way in which he leads the Chamber of Deputies and its position among fellow lawmakers, although critics say it has become a caricature, and that requires a deep reform.
"The framework in Joburg": Homeless young people enjoy photography courses
It is difficult to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood have found a way to learn a trade and earn a living.
"He was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teach young homeless to take photos of the areas in which they live and to earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports chief says that higher wages could harm the expansion
JD Sports chairman Peter Cowgill, says an increase in the minimum wage in Britain could mean "a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the buying power to overcome the higher costs for the workforce at the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on the plans for expansion of JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and criticized for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was the victim in the "storm" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behaviour deserves more praise and criticism, Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest of the talented duo often called the Special "KS," was unpleasantly dragged into the spotlight by the scandalous derapajul Kyrgios had to Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a qualification game crancen played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the seat of the referee had to intervene twice to split the Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put him down on Kyrgios, and I should have put it down on pustiul."
Although it was last seen making a rocket dust after he had crampe muscular diseases and missed a possible US Open tournament, upset Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was strongly defended by Healy.
Adolescentul is currently in Glasgow, where he struggles with Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
"One thing that I feel strongly is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a bit at odds," Healy said.
The truth is that ruptured a rocket when he lost because he accused crampe in the US, but it is not the first player to break a rocket in frustration with himself and Thanasi know him well enough to know that he would not be proud of that.
But to be serious, has permeated extremely well in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so forth, and I think it deserves a lot of confidence.
Has a great team, has a great family together and I think he was treated unfairly.
It's a very mature young man of 19 years, is working hard and has been integrated into the team, has not had any conflict with the other players, is highly respected, trains hard, is in excellent form, it is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and faults.
Healy also defended the decision to not take into account the important station Kyrgios for the match, which begins on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most suitable for everyone, but claimed the player's return from long-term Canberra team.
"Firstly, we want the team to focus entirely on the station and not to think at all about the controversy surrounding him [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick moved very quickly, as people have said such as Federer and Murray, he is maturing under the eyes of the public and has made some terrible mistakes and deserve to be criticised, but we are trying to support him, trying to help him to understand the consequences of his facts and I think it needs a time that is not in the spotlight in order to be able to reflect, good thing both for the team and for him.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders has been reduced to half in national polls
Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, still has a double-digit advantage in the race for the Democratic candidacy nationally, but Senatorul Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democrat voters (down from 58 per cent), while Sanders is second, with 27% (up 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, it is supported by 15% of Democrat voters.
At least five months before the primary election, the majority of Democrats say it is too early to say that they have decided on which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
The poll conducted by CBS news last month, Clinton has lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percentage points.
Clinton maintains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage was reduced.
Support among men has shrunk considerably and Sanders is at a distance of only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among Democrat voters under the age of 50 years has evaporated, now on par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in the lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton is in front of Sanders, with a double-digit percentage, among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight advantage by 5 points in this group.
About half of the Democrat voters nationwide say they would support a Clinton enthusiastically if it had chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support a somewhat reserved and the other 15% would support it only because it is the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters to be enthusiastic about its choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48 per cent of Democrat voters say they would support it enthusiastically on Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same thing about the first was Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When Clinton's supporters are being asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the answer is that it has the proper experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time for a woman to be president (13%) and that is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentions her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
It also notes the agreement on these issues and eligibility.
Given that the vice president takes into account a possible presidential bid, 57% of Democrat voters would like to see him in the race - although a third I think I should not run.
Question on the second option for the party's representative, Democrat voters call it a majority on Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half said that Biden would be the second option, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the race for the Democratic party, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders's rise, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if it is running.
55% of Democrat voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the general election; but the numbers have dropped from 78% as they were last month.
Biden is in distant second place but the percentage that is most eligible grew.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democrat voters prefer the problems instead of eligibility.
Just like last month, no Democrat candidate or possible candidate is not considered by these voters as unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democrat candidates or possible candidates are faring well in terms of a few key features to their party's primary voters.
The majority of voters view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as integrity and trust and with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen the best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
30% of Democrat voters do not believe that H. Clinton is trustworthy and integrate, twice more than those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democrat voters generally also believes that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideology as well.
On all these issues, about a quarter of Democrat voters do not have an opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist about the use of a personal email address and server by Hillary Clinton when he was Secretary of State, the majority of Democrats are satisfied with their explanation on the subject and say that it has not affected the overall opinion of the candidate.
But this is not the case among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided on this issue in March, shortly after the issue has come to light.
Most Americans say the controversy over email has not affected the overall opinion about Clinton, while 36% say they have changed their mind in a negative way.
Mainly Republicans, more than six in 10 say they have changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative sense.
Although Democrat voters see Clinton as trustworthy and integrate, this continues to raise questions among voters overall: Only 32% see it as reliable and integrate, with 8% fewer than last month and 15% fewer than in May.
62% of voters do not believe integrate and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters nationally do not consider Trump upstanding and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have the ups for leadership.
Among the six candidates assessed, Biden, Carson and Bush ranks first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider upstanding Sanders is higher than those who are not of the same opinion but, as in the case of Carson, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 voters Democrat mayors is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the brotherhood indicted for the murder of student in year 1 at Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student was killed during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the brotherhood IP Delta PSI from the Faculty Baruch in New York have been brutally attacked on chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and have delayed taking it to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police.
Official sources say the victim was tied to the eye, he was placed in the back with a 14-kg backpack filled with sand and was repeatedly bullied while trying to move towards a target on a frozen pitch.
Mr. Deng has accused headaches after that and lost consciousness.
Members of the brotherhood IP Delta PSI had not called the emergency number after he fainted and claimed they would have waited for an hour before taking it to the hospital, police say.
But they found the time to change his clothes Deng, to seek his symptoms on Google and to contact him on Andy Meng, president of brotherhood at national level, to seek advice from him, said the police chief, Chris Wagner, at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide personal belongings and have basically good brotherhood before Michael Deng's good," said Wagner.
He could not be revived and died the next morning.
According to a report by autopsie, Deng has suffered repeated head trauma, trunchi and coapse.
"Too many families have been devastated by fratiilor rituals, in 1970, at least one student was killed every year because of the rites," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, said in a statement.
Fratiile and their members should be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
Monroe district's grand jury has recommended that the first five members to be charged with the murder of three degree.
Thirty-two other mebrii of brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged for ultraj and complicity in murder.
"We want to be held accountable not only for the individuals involved but, if there is an organisation that authorised the Brotherhood, formally or informally, we will also hold accountable," Wagner said Tuesday at a press conference.
Baruch Faculty of the banned Muslim Brotherhood and the state withdrew its affiliation with local representation.
This is what will happen when the Fed will raise interest rates
Interest rates will rise and the Bull market (rising market) will stand, the bond value will increase and the economy will go into recession.
What we know.
What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will take.
In economics, history offers few clues on time.
After the first interest rate would rise, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor of how the response to the economy and the financial assets.
Therefore, the US central bank officials have grown so strong that investors should not focus on when starting to raise interest rates but the trajectory over time for normalisation.
Indeed, there are many variables at play.
But, in the end, the market players may find that the whole flap over interest rate rise was exaggerated.
"The first interest rate increase by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the" era of cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal levels but still small to constitute the seismic shock that seem to fear anyone.
But you can't say that there will be no effect.
Still present how could react to some sectors of the economy, based on historical trends:
Given the situation with which the market has faced in recent months, the anticipation of an interest rate rise may volatiliza things for a while.
But, at the time, the impact is not so dramatically.
"It seems that there is a trend that the return of capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first rise, which reflects the can again defazajul in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed hikes.
More specifically, in the past 35 years, the market has risen sharply - about 14 percent - heading for interest rate rises, quite invariabila from 250 days after (up an average of 2.6%) after which returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron's chief strategist at Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said the impact on action tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rising interest rates and the benefits are starting to decline.
The recession is a fact of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to this.
In the current situation, the Fed faces some conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
More specifically, the gross domestic product will be closer to its historic low point for a Fed interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since the 1950s, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 value was 3.6 per cent, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter rose only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Rising interest rates in an economy so fragile could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market players have prepared all year for a decision from the Fed, all eyes were on to this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in the interest rate on the occasion of this meeting, the futures trading indicates a probability of only 25%.
"In our study, conducted after 1950, all of the interest rate hike cycles so far have been in a super cycle of increasing profit, GDP dwarfing pre-recession peaks very quickly after the start of the recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, it was a strange slow recovery after the worst recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed at the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and he has reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is more quickly in the case of bonds than stocks when the Fed policy changes.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits of changing direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of rising interest rates, bond profitability declines immediately, "said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab strategy I believe that these rate increases will determine near profitability between short-term bonds and long-term ones, aplatizand curve.
The bonds with high profitability is faring better in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about forcing profitability," said in an analysis of Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adjusted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and lower inflation estimates, there are few signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policies," wrote Jones.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the cost curve is more right, spreads the average rate of interest credit has expanded and increased volatility - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly, companies operating in the US will benefit from the rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
The multinationals with large debts will suffer because the dollar will lead to higher prices for their products in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that the" quality "stocks tend to be more profitable in the subsequent three months after an initial interest rate of growth," Goldman Sachs analyst said in a report to clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets have outperformed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large receipts from capital and stocks with low volatility have also outperformed similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), or 3 (percentage points).
The debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a large percentage of debt flotanta have the most to lose, says Goldman.
Consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Those savings could also benefit, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classics FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticised the broadcaster for "prosteste"
He says it is increasingly similar to trade opponent
He also took the BBC Music Awards, claiming plagiarism Brits awards
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying that this show is not the original
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classics FM, said a senior lawmaker, putting pressure on the post to prove that doing something that commercial broadcasters are not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has also sent the heads of the BBC as a public radio station "prosteste" and increasingly resembles the commercial adversary.
"I have the impression that Radio 3" prosteste "- although I do not like to use the word - but I have the impression that turns into Classics FM," he said.
He also took the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, the Brits seem to be under another name.
So, if you are trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that only serve to duplicate what already exists in the market, "said Mr Bingham.
The director general of the BBC has denied the allegations, saying the BBC Radio 3 is far in front of his opponent in the live music business and educating the public.
I will not learn anything about classical music to hear on Radio 3.
And its commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important to Radio 3 to discover new music and the allocation of new plays," he said.
In the first part of this year, the editor of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that we need to work harder to attract an audience from the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only thing under the banner of the BBC criticised the committee meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport because it would go in the footsteps of its trade rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the show of talent bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for around £22 million.
You understand why there are often discussions about the issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the show made by BBC1 - with the Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - to be done "in a manner specific to the BBC."
He added that he wants the corporation "to find the chicken with golden eggs in their own backyard," next time launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the future takeover of new seasons of The Voice or to spend money that go on the licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales have recorded the lowest growth in August and the fault could be Black Friday
In the first three months of the year 2015, online sales rose by 7%.
In the past month has seen the slower growth from 2000 to date.
Online sales have taken off three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phone to make purchases.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could determine the reluctance to expenses.
For more than a decade, online shopping exploded and have transformed Britain's commercial streets into ghost towns.
Experts, however, say there are signs that online sales are cut, the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of the year 2015.
The total money spent in August unveiled the smallest increase since 2000 to date, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are cut, the latest figures showing an increase of just 7% in the first three months of the year 2015.
"If you look at the level of growth in previous years and we go back to 2000, there was always a tendency streamlined over time," said Andy Mulcahy, an editor at IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales have taken off three years ago, when buyers began to use a mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, has increased the number of people who could make online purchases and could do in various circumstances, such as on canapea.
But now that stalled a little, you could see a decrease (increase).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, imported from America, it is listed as one of the reasons for falling sales.
In the opinion of the specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers flocked to the computers to put their hands on bids, which led to the collapse of the websites of several retailers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers were beaten on bargains, could prompt reluctant buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium has determined that at least £1 in every £5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing cars, more than a third of purchases are currently through online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to use fashion stores in commercial areas.
After sanctioning the Bin Laden family, Muslims ingroapa victims killed in the wake of the collapse of macaralei in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were plimbate streets by Muslims, the first funeral taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partly blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.

In the stroll down the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a collapsed crane at the grand mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, who joined the dead were crying on the way to express their condolences, until the first dead came at the end of the final trip, Al-Moaissem cemetery.
Sad memories preserved the holy site, where only a few days ago was a construction crane crashed through tavanul Moscheei, dropping the faithful.
The bodies were released for the funeral after the king of Saudi Arabia has sanctioned construction group of the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also ended with 394 injured.
In a ceremony carried out on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a collapsed crane at the grand mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, on his first pilgrimage when crashed macaraua.
Mr Akram is in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj pelerinajului.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims to remain in the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not leave macaralei arm raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the crash.
Service in the English news agency did not detail, but said the company's leaders have been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier during this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the Great Mosque macaralei in the courtyard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the hajj pelerinajului which takes place later this month.
Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of macaralei and Group representatives could not be contacted for comment.
The royal decree has blamed the group for failing to use safety measures and has not coordinated the work with meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and the ongoing major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden was a son "disowned," dezmostenit family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in conditions of strong wind and rain, with only a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to attend the pilgrimage, the essential travel at least once in a Muslim's life physically fit.
Authorities say the 158 people remain in hospital.
Authorities have decided that the deceased relatives of victims to receive one million Saudi Riali (£174.000) and the same amount to pay for those with permanent injuries.
Other injured will receive half of that amount.
The advantages and disadvantages of conversion loans in Swiss francs
The banking market has already had two offers of conversion in lions of loans in Swiss francs, the main benefit being excluding currency risk and rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when the variable interest rate can lead to higher rates.
Transylvania Bank has just completed the process of conversion franc loans granted by Volksbank and Post Bank announced the offer of conversion for their clients.
According to the cumulative data from analysts financial portal FinZoom, Post Bank offers three-year fixed rate at lions, 1.5%, the lowest in the market.
On the other hand, the conversion of the Bank's offer was accepted by 83% of customers with loans in francs due to two successive cuts: Reduced balance with the value of risk and management fees paid by the client, then applied a further reduction of 22.5% to balance the lions.
Both offers reduced rates to their customers, as well as the monthly pay equivalent in lei before the conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate of 42.5%, while the Post Bank, with 33% in the first three years and, in theory, with 18 per cent in the coming years.
Benefits for
The main advantage of the lions covresiei credit in CHF is that it eliminates the currency risk, the consumer being protected from future increases of Francs, and the mortgage repayment will be made in the currency in which they collect salary.
Another major advantage of both offers of conversion is that there is a reassessment of the property, is no longer require additional guarantees and another proof of income.
Basically, it will not make a new legal and financial analysis of the credit and will be additional costs as in the case of a refinantari.
Also, both banks offer to reduce the monthly rate, compared to how much customers were paying before the conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risks of
The problem is that the rate of childhood is made up more of the interest and very little customer repaying the principal.
The Post Bank offer very low interest rate in the first three years seems advantageous for customers.
Do not know how it will turn out that rate after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25%, so the total, and cutting costs is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest rate, is that the ROBOR index to rise significantly in the coming years (more than Libor index - CHF).
For example ROBOR three months is now 1.44 per cent, but in 2013 reached the value of 6% in 2009 to more than 15%, and in a few days in 2008 exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to defend and other costs, mentioned in the original offer.
The time for decisions on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world atinteste its gaze towards meeting scheduled over two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will take the crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, slightly more than half who last week thought the decision would be made, I think now that the situation will keep for a while and that interest rates will be kept within the current 0-0.25%.
It is a historic event because it has been seven years since the Fed has brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are faced with a situation in which a major central bank could drop to zero rate and to initiate a process of normalisation of interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, the recovery of trillions of dollars in stock and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Fed should not ignore the global situation less rosy.
He warned the markets to prepare for an increase but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20: 00 TEC.

Luke Shaw player from Manchester United sit on the bar a few months due to the double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to the right leg in the match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, which ended with a defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears in the eyes of the player and it will keep the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
Injuring occurred following a reckless intervention from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, at the age of 20 years, he hacked the PSV defence.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "Has the double fracture in his leg and is in the hospital."
It will be transferred tomorrow or the day after then will be operated in Manchester.
It is appalling - a boy who came to the Manchester United when he was 18 years old, have difficulty, then playing fantastic and now something like this happens.
In the locker room was put the oxygen mask.
Plangea..
I am not a doctor, but the double fracture repausul is six months and will not play in the grupelor phase.
I hope to be able to play again this season.
It appears that Moreno was lucky and escaped the red card and the concession of a penalty kicks.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli has not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for themselves when I say that it is foul and a red card.
It was a very ugly, with two legs.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for your messages, I have no words to express how I feel weakened, start the road to recovery, I will come back stronger."

Fundasul England team has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.

Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players are not never accidenteze to an adversary.
Moreno and broke her foot playing for Mexico's national team against the Netherlands led by Van Gaal at the World Cup in 2014.
"It is very difficult because it was not intended to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that this is a very serious injury, it's not good," said Cocu.
I have not seen the stage.
We have not been able to see than the ball, heading in a different direction, so it seemed like [Moreno] has reached her but I could not see Luke's intervention.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel bad foare, I feel so bad.
PSV player, Andrés Guardado, also arrived at the hospital after an intervention from Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has risked clear omission of England but it is still cool
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after I saw the England squad for the tournament, do not take into account a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the Test matches.
I would not eliminate any version of away victories.
Maybe Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good players on the thorn in the batting line and collective morale is strong; they will not be burdened by the in 2012 but will have a positive attitude and youthful.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if it is unknown at the level of testing, is an option for the attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth has left the England team for the Test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his coach of Yorkshire, I find it difficult to look at the decision not to select him on Adam Lyth in the team.
He played seven Test matches against two good strikers, in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no question marks about Joe Root, for example, until the ads have been made since - and I have said it before - the players are their own selectioneri.
Some fifty years and perhaps Lyth and would have extended the run but his fate is in his hands.
I hope that if you do more run workshops for Yorkshire will have other opportunities.
Head coach of England, Bayliss, praised the attitude even when the performance was not commensurate with his ability and I am not surprised by this; above all, he is a man of the team.
It is hard to answer the question of how long is noticed a batsman in Test matches.
Lyth had seven-run - and Sam Robson ahead to - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had luck at home and away.
The only complaint you can have was that England had preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in top form - but the missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
The team comes Alex Hales, a batsman whom cotez very well.
It is a cricket player who has the "X Factor" and I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge pitch.
Should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea that Moeen was launched to open at the neck with Cook, which could lead to extrajudicial spinner while preserving the four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a aruncator could not hit there and this clumsy player has already demonstrated that he is damned.
Maybe Moeen has not brought success in his district, Worcestershire, was No 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old colleague team, Justin Langer, played his first 38 38 test matches that first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately deleted three centuries and has not looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as back-up spinner and, although I have had limited contact with him, to me that is a very impressive young man.
People may judge his young age - with an average of 31 to 35 and firing the ball - and believes it could punt, but there is not a lot of selectionerii spinneri and opted for youth.
Will learn a lot from this tournament.
England has made some changes in the team of coaches.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as consultant for Test matches could be a blow to the master.
It is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in every situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to White-Ball to the tournament and will bring both energy and ruthless ambition.
I have always believed that he was born to get involved in the international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela, has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if you send messages that have been sent previously, can bring fresh air into the team.
Durham Colly's teammate, Ben Stokes is odihneste for one-day matches, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
While not all agree, the coaches and selectionerii does not make the program.
And we should note, the jobs of the players depend on the results you get.
Such decisions are not taken never easy.
Brexit camp could prevail if the economy remains in a lull until 2017
Every day, the strategy of renegotiation of David Cameron to keep Britain in the EU into mounting a mess, even without the election genialului Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn to lead the Labour Party or the TUC brings serious criticism Tuesday from Europe.
Foreigners also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained that the last few days - sunk in similar crises in the EU - not all of them caused internally - some member states are powered by Britain's agenda of concessions and changes to the treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC has decided that they do not want this if it would erode social protection.
We could even call the agenda "selfie" of Dave and George.
Prime Minister and the Chancellor to attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without a local representative, then come home and say they won allies for reform.
It is just about me.
My friend, who wants a Great Britain with outward perspective under the roof of the EU - "We are alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that several ministers and officials obtuzi in certain capitals have reached the point where they do not care if they stay or go.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor extremely cautious, is an ally but has stayed at the helm for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation to unravel, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, the French President, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain one on the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland out of Britain - something we don't want her either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers could be even intended to make remarks that do not help, in the style of the SNP in the referendum campaign in Britain in 2017 to speed up the process of Brexit, my amicul suggests.
"The renegotiation was fixed" and "Britain has not achieved anything of value in the renegotiation."
Europeans know on their skin as acaparatoare may be Fleet Street and how skeptics are the media barons who are sceptical about the EU, because they have not participated in the referendum in 1975 inspired by Tony Benn who has ratified our entry in 1973 in 2: 1.
Can vaguely remember of Boris Johnson, Euro-oportunistul, who became famous in the early 1990s when it was corespodent of Brussels.
ED Miliband knew their enemies.
They included the mix of pungasi neplatitori taxes, foreign phone fraudau and pseudo-Domi who hold most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair will see about as though he realised that when you're locked in a doghouse with a gorila skittish, we need to give them bananas to distract from the thought of you eat at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to the idea of Cameron's referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the EU constitution abandoned, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him an exit card.
The media has not forgiven for that.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who was a friend, hit back on Monday at Westminster - I told him not to consume his time with me - seems to be in danger from egg to adopt the strategy to boycott Murdoch of Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It can take time, but we need to develop a coherent strategy for cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC's holiday on Sunday.
Corbyn's official stance towards Europe is what I would call with gentle evolution.
He says he would like to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of those who do not agree with the "anglicismul" conservatives could agree with that.
That said, "A Hilary Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and TV this week, when the cercetasul he has struggled not to recognise that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as a minister of the "shadow" financial problems was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his father was fought on TV to be unfairly Labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing their position in the cabinet.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But the fight to stay "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond with what McDonnell said nor what JC said colleagues and lawmakers in a private meeting Monday night.
Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to convey - remember, I was on me - the discipline and awareness messages remain important in the television era, and especially in social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to be given a ticket for Cameron's favour in Europe, allowing her to take good supporting Labour in the campaign for the referendum, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell's basic sofismul and Corbyin on membership of the EU - in line with their past anti-capitalist - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents narcisismul for small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sofismului on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant about the fact that JC will not campaigning for the exit - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should scupper Paris or Berlin political capital - and there are voters suspicious - for concessions to Britain when everything could be worthless?
The US are already pretty disappointed about the poor englezilor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cut costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum, on Monday.
Experts criticise the decision of the Department of Public Health England on electronic cigarettes
According to the researchers, a government agency claims that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with ties to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the magazine's British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet paper criticising the evidence used by the Department of Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE has published the report "benchmark" last month and described him as a "comprehensive analysis of the evidence."
Some researchers have raised questions about the robustness of data and pointed fingers at the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical magazine Lancet attacked the "extraordinarily fragile basis" on which he founded PHE main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in the BMJ have questioned the claims and their base "on solid ground or sand miscator."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
Said they expect the PHE claims that the "current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, one meeting attended by 12 people led to the drafting of a model of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to summarise their views on the negative effects associated with different products that contain nicotinoid; the results of this meeting were shown briefly in a research paper.
McKee and his Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director has said that it would be in the past received funding from British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.
He also validated the accreditation of BAT in Public Health in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting said the funding received from an electronic cigarette manufacturer but not the financing that there are reports that he had received from the producer of cigarettes and tobacco company Philip Morris International.
Have not provided the arguments on the basis of which were selected panelului members but they include several "fruntasi" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even say the finance industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control at PHE.
The research group developed it whitewashes "conclusively" that the lack of "solid evidence on the detrimental effect it has most products under the majority of the criteria," said McKee and Capewell.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell said PHE claims that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health at PHE, says it has responded in the past to the claims in the BMJ.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two people who have smoked all her life loses his life because of this defect.
All the evidence suggests that the risk posed by e-cigarettes for health are minor in comparison, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information and those who do not stem from evidence, especially given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a disease associated with smoking and the annual costs incurred by the NHS from smoking to reach 2 billion pounds.
Expressing clear current evidence - namely that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without its risks, it is only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - our national debt.

Ads that make shame Britain's arms trade
Watch the film produced by Amnesty International against the arms fair.

But a separate campaign has also led to the display of a large number of posters at bus stops and in metrouri needing a second glance.

Directed by transport in London is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of flyers.
One of the ads parody produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Cruel Designs curator and senior lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are more and more questions and seek to make political work accessible to the public outside galeriilor.
Many artists are looking to collaborate with activists in protest movements, realising that we need to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that have commuter travelling with Metro.
The film produced by Amnesty had more than 100,000 Facebook vizualizari in 24 hours and was created by advertising agency VCCP who worked pro bono, and graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice have also worked for free.
Creative director of VCCP, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the advertising for the arms fair - with an empty space in the calendar Excel - and thought, "Let's give the campaign is trying to avoid it."
Have played with a more realistic ads but "enriching it with animatii and strong colours, was more striking."
"They have done a great job helping us to increase interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take action to ensure that the devices of torture are not illegally sold and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the arms comes from within Excel, where the eufemistice expozantii offers fantastic products.

Violinist David Grimal: Bach's era there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who work, artists and trade representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as little as well as the initiator of a less familiar, downright "weird," as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra composed of international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a repertoire simfonic without a conductor, and that makes it to be at least a curiosity in the classic musical landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: A performance on Sunday, in which little was David Grimal, founder of the orchestra, and one on Monday, when the spotlight was cellist Xavier Phillips, the compound works by Enescu as nelipsite.
Both performances, held on stage Ateneului, showed the public another way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004, at the time, the only classical music as a whole in which there is not a conductor.
Conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand the musicians need an education or to become soloists, either to become performers in an orchestra - speak instrumentisti, not composers.
They are trained as "specialist workers."
They themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.
On the other side of the scene, to the public, all musical fetisizarea focuses on the conductor.
And so, businessul, the music industry, is its marketing.
Therefore, no longer talking about the music.
So, if you look at this world, we have the skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but we need to look at, and what is stupid, "believes David Grimal.
Violinist describes this change in the way that makes the music came from the musical "disillusionment" in his career.
I was a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise in the whole world with different orchestras, to earn money and to bring the money and the music industry.
10 years ago, when I was around 30 years ago, I found it very depressing, because no longer 'creativity and human fraternity in this system.
So, I have not found any connection to continue on this path.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happens in 2004, and at the time nobody was doing it without a conductor: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"As you can imagine to do marketing with a collective of musicians in which no more ego?" Asks the artist.
David Grimal admits Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury," saying that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra does not depend on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a hindrance in his music: "Curiously, sings a more complex repertoire, so it seems easier, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the work and not just in the role," says Grimal, adding that Sunday's performance was "74 conductors on stage."
In Grimal's view, the Enescu Festival is "very courageous," precisely because he invited and Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where are the greatest orchestras in the world who sings and 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invited and this strange group."
In a temple of orchestrale tradition, as is the Enescu Festival, there is the place and the interest for something different that breaks barriers.
Speaking about the work of Enescu, Romanian violinist admits he feels the music of the famous Romanian composer, so did not need a special approach when he introduced the Enescu works in his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk of George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made the French music."
Grimal is committed to changing how it makes classical music education, believing that "the profession of musician, as it is called today, has a flavour of death" and that "the future of music is the music itself."
We do not need to do the rounds of the world 5 times a year if it does not serve at all.
In the era of Bach there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who work, who were artists and not trade representatives.
For me, holding concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albumelor, all are tremendous, extraordinary, but as long as they are in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity is suffering, no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave the example of the Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before we enter the EU, had good meat and vegetables."
In order to enter the EU had to adopt sanitary laws which are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are in the supermarkets, as is the case in France.
The music is the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances red is perhaps not too nice, but when they cut the tomatoes are true.
In an ideal world, should this music to return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system to understand that music doesn't need to be sold, but it needs to be shared, and this can be done from the educational policy.
"If I believe - as do the Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce his learning in school, we reintroduce the concerts on TV and through this education would no longer be required to sell music by-products," Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, this everywhere, is something very militarised.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if they form a musician who will play an instrument, and, above all, the musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, is something else entirely.
After your parearea, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? "Asks the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of a different kind of music comes from overcoming this status of "soldier," overcoming what they believe are the "limits": "Musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and that is why after the concert come out smiling."
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and about his music and the artist in the "Festival of ideas," a discussion with the public held at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Institute Romania.

FedEx gains are mixed, falling fiscal projections for 2016.
FedEx said the disappointing results for the last quarter, the oil giant cutting profit estimates for the year as a result of lower demand for transport services and increased costs for land transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
During the same period last year, FedEx announced it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares have fallen by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, with 45 minutes before the sound clopotelului opening Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10,40 and 10,90 dollars for the fiscal year that ends in May next year, with 20 cents less, according to a previous estimates.
Analysts predicted the figure of 10,84 dollars, according to a poll by FactSet.
The estimate comes despite rising prices fall 4.9% on average, with the entry into force on 4 January and higher suprataxele for land transport of large packages or large weight, which will apply in November.
The company said it still expects to increase earnings from the previous year as a result of cutting costs, higher incomes and the development of e-commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that "the company is facing an economic situation considerably weaker than expected, particularly in terms of production and global trade."
The hiring plans during the holiday season were announced a day after competitor UPS said it plans to hire additional 95.000-90,000 workers, roughly the same number of employees that he did last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx won Katavic million dollars, 6% more than the previous year.

Tuesday at scazusera closing 11% on a year and 17% from the record peak recorded on 11 June.
The most anticipated meetings in recent years, with policy makers at the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a table of Honduran mahon with 27 feet to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above their heads, at one end of the hall of the central bank, will glimpse a mural of the United States.
The map is intended to recall that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed Chairman, and his colleagues have to put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has received a double burden from Congress: To maximise the rate of employment in the US and to maintain price stability.
But the economic crisis, the Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: Financial stability.
And this third pregnancy could be the X factor in a decision is too difficult to predict, which will be announced on Tuesday, and that will determine whether the US economy is ready to be dezbarata of unprecedented stimulus provided by short-term interest rate near zero in place since late 2008.
Even if the majority of the data indicates a strong growth in the economy, the recent global financial markets could scare off the Fed officials are already wary about adding volatility by increasing the benchmark federal funds rate - even with a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and the main issues we will be watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, rising uncertainty in the global market is enough to give them arguments to wait," she said.
There is no consensus regarding the decision that we will take the Fed, this in itself causing instability in the financial market.
About half of the economists polled by Bloomberg recently predicted a rise in interest rates this week.
But the financial markets expect the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises interest rates, except where those developing policies would cushion the blow by promising that it would take a long time until the next boom.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228,89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16.599,85.
The momentum was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy makers will keep interest rates stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising that the Fed to raise interest rates at this time," Lonski said.
If the Fed decision makers would do this, "should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets."
Other experts have said that an increase in the interest rate would calm financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on track to increase the rate of 0.25 per cent this month, the first small step towards the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that was expecting an interest rate rise this year despite the objections of liberals as that would need more economic progress.
Although job creation has slowed in August, the labour market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and nearly the level of the Fed believed that full employment of labour.
Wage gains showed signs of growth.
And although inflation has continued to achieve the annual goal of the central bank, Fed policy makers have said that a key reason was a temporary effect of the sharp drop in oil prices.
"The economy can withstand higher rates and needs them, given the tension of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the global financial markets have begun to enter fibrilatii later this month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 16 per cent below the record peak reached in May, as investors have feared that the slowing Chinese economy will drag down global growth.
The market reculat somewhat this month, the Dow is now about 10% below the peak in May.
For the Fed decision makers, the market is added to the complex calculation of the timing of rising interest rates.
"Without what happened in financial markets and the news about the Chinese economy weakened in recent weeks, it would be the strongest in a meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a researcher with expertise in the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he expected to wait at least a month in order to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and almost no data on which to base subsequent events in China," Oliner said.
When the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so that basically should not be taken into account in making decisions.
But, in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority in the world.
In recent years, the central bank's influence was huge.
Simple reminder of the then chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Fed could "narrow" monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are twinned with more and more, it is expected that Fed officials not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at wealth management firm Envestnet, Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Please., said this month that "the Fed has a history of bloated reaction to changes in the financial market that seem to have no connection with the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the body with decision-making role, which has supported the increase in the interest rate, provided that such decisions in 1998-99.
A financial crisis that hit Asia prompted the Fed to cut its benchmark rate to 0.75 per cent in three meetings, "despite the possibility of identification with limited implications for the development of the US," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials have reversed their respective scaderilor.
EDF should put the issue of financial stability in the first place only in case of a major crisis, such as the earthquake was on the market in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the interest rate setting committee at the Bank of England.
Last turbulent period not long at that level, he said.
"Certainly we don't want to get into fears of a rise in interest rates because the markets have been upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve still holds dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability and, until will change anything in this regard, I don't think we should take action prematurely.

According to him, were wounded twenty police officers and five civilians.

Weight reduction surgery could be useful in the case of easy diabeticilor with obesity
Chirurgiei benefits of reducing weight in the case of people with obesity, type 2 diabetes with zaharat could keep for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether the easy diabeticii with obesity live longer after surgical intervention for weight loss than those who follow nechirurgicale treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralise the data on mortality," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, the car she wrote an article about the new study in Jama Surgery.
For weight loss surgery, surgery and called bariatrica, using various methods to reduce stomacul.
This reduces the feeling of hunger and limits the ability of the body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatrica surgery has proved effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes zaharat, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index of 35 or higher (IMC).
IMC, a measure of weight in relation to the match, is considered normal in the range 18.5-24.9.
The IMC value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with IMC over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate the IMC accesand: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan have used data collected since 2007 in a trial in which compares two types of bariatrica surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomie in Shirley - in the medical treatment of zaharat type 2 diabetes in people with obesity.
IMC environment for people who have undergone surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year as part of the study.
Meanwhile, the IMC who received nechirurgicale treatments against diabetes zaharat remained almost at the same level, which is 29.
Among those who have undergone surgery, diabetes zaharat has completely healed at 36% and partly to 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes zaharat was completely healed at only 1% and partly to just 2% of respondents.
In addition, the control tension arteriale, trigliceridele and LDL "bad" cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored the level of sanguin hemoglobinei A1c, which reflects the glicemiei level over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobinei A1c is below 7%.
After the surgical intervention, the average A1c hemoglobinei has dropped from around 9% to around 6%.
But in the group treated by medical methods, stood at about 8%.
But this "improved glicemic control" - reflected the improved levels of A1c hemoglobinei - have not reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng HSU and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In its fifth year, compared with the group with gastrectomie in Shirley, the surgery group having lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), had more severe decline in the value of IMC (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobinei A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and showed a higher probability of complete diabetes remisiune zaharat (46.9% to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on people with high weight in Sweden that surgical intervention prolongs life, says Blackstone, University of Arizona, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who have undergone surgery bariatrica showed a probability of about 29% lower to die after 15 years, compared with a group that has tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients who have undergone surgery, Blackstone said it is optimistic for people with IMC under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is the point at which this work is critical, because it says that this surgery is safe in the group with low IMC," without increasing the risk of death or illness renala, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start -sa takes weight seriously then the IMC's patient reaches 27-30.
"I think we expect too much to urge people to take this seriously," she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have scurtcircuitat predispunandu bodies them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely hard to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has sent a call to end the violence in the refugee's mother.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the issue of the current refugee crisis in a speech delivered at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for compassion in Oxford, dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of individual nations and even of every continent.
He also stressed that, while admirable, Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama has praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It's wonderful care for the thousands of refugees, but we have to think at the same time the long-term solutions to bring genuine peace and development, particularly through education, in Muslim countries," he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems, "he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama has also commented about the actions of George Bush after the terrorist attacks on September 11, saying the violent response from the US has caused a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 11 September, we have sent their condolences in a letter to President Bush and I told him to solve this problem without having to resort to violence.
I know that his motives were strong but used the force and led to unexpected consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.

Why are witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Later today, except for a belated legal intervention, I will look like a man is sentenced to death.
If that happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will sit in a room for observers from the floor of the prison's execution of Oklahoma and I will see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January, with the best friend of his, and, although I was shocked, I accepted.
As we get closer to the day, I purport the idea.
So, why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
Would provide a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, as usual requests exceed the number of seats available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
Those elected will watch the execution with impartiality.
I can't do it.
I sit next to his closest friends of Richard Glossip, in addition I have developed my own contact with him over the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two hours and a half.
I like the type.
Radem often much when we talk.
Prison authorities say they cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not allow myself to have a carnetel and a pix to note what they see.
Will have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter that compromising my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Detainee tells the story as he wants, to get access.
I complained about it.
He acknowledged that "could have been a better formula," but is still think are wrong.
Richard Glossip did not agree with some of the things I said and I wrote.
I cannot tell you what to write, and I would not do it even if I'd asked.
I told him that I can remove from the list of witnesses ever.
But wants to be present an international report that to write about the subject.
Believes that, if he dies, the publicity will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to hear more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that I have done.
I will not come back here on all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it is very likely to be not guilty of murder.
I strongly believe that there were not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think the execution is wrong.
And I will watch dying from this perspective.
I can't pretend that I am totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me, you will know how it is to watch a man like him dying needlessly.
Peter Moody claims stewarzii tried to spy on him and threatening to withdraw from the race
Peter Moody said stewarzii Racing Victoria or tried to a spy on his grajdurile last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
Launched an attack against stewarzilor and Racing Victoria's integrity department, saying that they are running a personal campaign against him, the straw that broke the camel as Lady Tatai's removal from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the races and that is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result from the test for Lidari's cobalt, which has no explanation.
For 18 months and has swallowed up the words on the statements about spies and did not want to resemble, "which does not reach the grapes."
"I was not going to say anything about that issue and I was silent for a long time but sometimes reach a level of frustration is so high that everything suddenly rabufneste," Moody's said.
It is known that continued.
Sometimes react and the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Diseara I will go home and I'll sleep.
I want to go with our heads held high and I am working with the owners to see that I do my best to give everything is better.
From the moment they begin to believe that is not the case, we need to quit the profession trainer.
At that point we will have to think what I will do with my certification.
Previously, Moody threw a bomb in an interview given to the racing.com said the integrity department tried to spy grajdurile.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sitting in a room with a man - whose name I will say if I'm asked - and have offered to hire my grajdurile in order to provide information about the work there," said Moody for Racing.com.
Obviously I am a trisor.
If so, then they should give their all their resignations because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, the current president of RVL and Bernard Saundry, Executive Director and current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and I know today.
Should I think it is something personal?
It is necessary that RVL to begin to have some backbone and to hold people outside trainerilor for what is happening in the industry?
I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe so see the others.
Maybe I should take the license and to give me a hand and I have no doubts that the statements that I make now could lead to think about this.
But we have reached the point where I no longer cared about and that makes me sad.
I am very saddened.
I will put pressure on and I will get to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
Trainerului frustration grew with the lengthy investigation on the cobalt testing involving Lidari and removal prompted him to say that he could "to put their license on the table."
Moody, whose name is most often associated with training Campionului neinvins Black Caviar, branded fine treatment on the day of the race as "ridiculous" after it was applied to the feet of a stopgap with namol or clay, which violates the rules.
It breaks the rules of.
I must take full responsibility for this, "he says.
One of my employees has put in namol mistake on the leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, what has happened.
Happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment of race in the application cataplasmei, for which stewarzii opened an investigation.
It is a joke.
The people who make these rules do not know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules but has gone too far," Moody's said.

Melbourne Storm coach, Craig Bellamy, to answer their opponents in allegations of wrestling.
Melbourne Storm coach, Craig Bellamy, called the criticism of placare tactics used by his team as "distorted" issues raised by the two main favourites in the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees have allowed the Storm players to "take them to grips" team in the match won by Storm nervous in the final qualifier on Friday evening in Sydney.
The Brisbane Broncos coach, Wayne Bennett, made a slight reference to the Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match with North www.wfdeaf.org Cowboys, played on Saturday evening, when he called the game a "demonstration" of rugby league and said that the two teams from www.wfdeaf.org luminaries are not in wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in to defend the tactics of placare addressed by his team and said the players were simply "touch" when placau.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two senior coaches have criticised the team, meaning that they were worried that the storm will prevail.
"And it gets worse - I have not heard Trent Robinson to complain of wrestling when we were beaten with the score 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that I have not changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, just as much as in the last six weeks we have really put emphasis on contact in placari and so I changed the situation.
Trent is in office for three years and obviously has a great team, so perhaps that is not used to losing, and it was a shock to him.
Nostim as always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy has contradicted the idea of Bennett's "Francophone football," reminding mentorului or St George-Illawarra Dragons's Bennett won the championship in 2010 playing football "boring."
Wayne speaks about the thrilling football.
He argued comparandu view their game on Saturday night with our game Friday night and talked about how thrilling was the game, "said Bellamy.
I remember that, in 2010, St George has received a lot of criticism because it was a boring team and Wayne said he was not interested in either as black under unghie.
But now has a team that can play what I see as thrilling football, particularly young mijlocasilor manoeuvering.
This is the kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He made this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two mijlocasi as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because I am somewhat worried about the match with us.
Now six weeks were probably not to us when we were in big matches.
Bellamy has also highlighted the fact that the match between the Storm and Roosters was a stiffer race tied the score compared to the match between the Broncos and Cowboys.
The game against the Broncos was probably a good game, we have not yet seen, as was the score? 16-12?
Our match ended 20-18, in our game there were two attempts, that means thrilling game?
Or thrilling means to get the breaks and not marchezi?
For me are the plans.
If we talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet.
Storm is free this weekend because they have earned the right to play at home or with North www.wfdeaf.org Cowboys, with the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminariilor final next Saturday at AAMI Park, with tickets on sale starting next Tuesday, in the morning.

FriendsFest: The comedy series that has taught us important lessons about friendship between men
Similar personajelor absence in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, the rates of suicide among young men reaching the peak of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 years in Britain, and is three times more common in men than in women.
In a bid to tackle the problem, the Campaign against the unfortunate life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (Calm) has designated 2015 as the Year Barbatului, wanting to question the culture that prevents men seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted on more than 2000 high school students who showed symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by many friends enough "with a healthy mood," his chances of catching doubles.
Similarly, for those who are not deprimate, a circle of friends mentally healthy to halve the probability of mental disorders.
Of course, that friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is on style and not substance, the immediate response is often the priority before contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personalities, open to fun and successful, even though in reality it is the isolation that prevails.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call the extrinseci values; money, image, social status, all the cost of the intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - and more deeply affecting our mental health.
Aul billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that the money does not buy happiness.
The beauty of the series Friends was that the attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by the workplace but its own personality, which showed by interacting as friends.
Joey's frequent imbratisarilor humor and Somali, when they watch the cushy seats and Ross's passion for Chandler came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even if it often shrugs off to completely explore their feelings.
As I explained a social worker: "... my job is to listen to people with the trend of suicide and deprimate showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, the people who come to us do not feel able to talk with friends.
The old adage that one can is strong, as well as the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about the problems.
Friends is one of the series that come to mind when I try to give more mechanisms of long-term psychological adjustment.
The show has highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
No matter how much help the objective intervention, outside, via telephone, people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you participate in this weekend at FriendsFest staged comedy Central, restoring full platourilor film to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends over coffee at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smiling and you welcome.
You never know what a difference it could make your friendship.
Comedy Central Friends is broadcast from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - at # FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and help PSG to Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he scored against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG to assert itself in front of the Swedish team Malmo.
We will continue to chronicle the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have done their duty, Paris Saint-Germain from the series matches in the Champions League groups, with a reassuring victory 2-0 against Malmo in the match played on Tuesday on the Park des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes at the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the French champions ahead although they missed a number of occasions before securing the advantage with Cavani's goal he scored in the 61st minute.
In Group A along with Real Madrid and Sahtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the French team's goal is not the only qualification for the next round but also an improvement in the journey towards the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
But, although they have taken the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity gap after that was replaced by the team in his hometown and the club and began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 victory they create problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable margin over the runners, even if there are issues that we need to improve throughout the season," Blanc says.
It is a good sign.
We wanted to win and I did it, although I am sorry that I failed to give one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic has returned after injuring at one of three changes to the team in Paris, with a station 2-2 achieved at home to Bordeaux in the League 1 at the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month, when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who will lead PSG to the next level in Europe and has demonstrated this when he tasnit on Marco Verratti's pass behind the defence of Malmo before suteze incredible over Johan Wiland, long in the right corner of the goal.
But if anyone expected that PSG pocnind off the fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with the new holders of the national teams, with a defence of five people and two mijlocasi defensivi, was a strong contender.
But their attack was not impressive, the exception-Nikola Djurdjic who passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, the PSG players have slowed several times, giving a few passes and nefinalizand interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five attempts in the first half and was replaced by Cavani then even after the resumption of play.
Ibrahimovic has proved far more skilled in support of his colleagues, his care being the one that Di Maria has sent a shot diverted by Wiland over the door in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after over an hour of the match, because of Cavani, uruguayanul who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic batting from Maxwell's centrarea.
This gap has eliminated the hope in Malmo that will rebalance the score and only a superb stop Wiland's remotely for rejecting David Luiz has kept the final score before new intratului Ezequiel Lavezzi to cancel a goal in stoppage time.
Norwegian coach of the team in Malmo, Age Hareide, said afterwards that PSG were a class above, and that "The game we have played in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, I have only played in the league in Sweden, which is not up to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Hats off for PSG.
Have made an excellent game.

The report of the TVR, rejected in committee: Stelian Tanase risked dismissal
The culture of the House committees on Wednesday rejected the report of the Governing Council of the Romanian Society of Television in 2014.
For rejecting the report have voted 17 MPs, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be submitted to the permanent offices together.
They will decide, probably next week.
At the next plenary meeting will be debated.
"I think in light of this situation will be done relatively quickly," said the chairman of the culture of the Senate, Georgica Severin.
He added that it was "common sense" as the leadership of TVR to be present at this meeting, while the Commissions culture was not present any representative of the TVR.
It was good to be present at TVR because nobody here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation was made by CA members since last night, with an approximate time that he did not know any new hour, but today, after the joint Offices, I sent a fax to the leadership of TVR inviting her.
I think when you're called, you as a government employee, paid for by public taxes and you are summoned to a meeting of the joint committees even if you do not like it.
"Because it is your obligation service, you're in an institution in charge of the House," said Severin after the joint Committees of Parliament's culture.
He added that the meeting were discussed the financial aspects of the institution on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw ourselves as continued, came up with the idea that this year would be the day, but have not been paid from the historical ones.
"I remind you that it's not my fault or anyone else in these committees has lost that pleasure with the banks and fiscul, are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the plenary meeting will follow the elections for a new administration, and he will choose the general director of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this post.
Miracles will not do.
It is important to take political decisions for this institution to function.
I am not a man to lie, to tell you that there will be a genius who will sit in the queue here and it will be blowing.
I hope that those who decide, the House of Parliament, through their vote to choose the very reason people who will lead the TVR.
We need to be people who know what is happening there, to have the experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who will be, if you ask me what qualities should have - common sense in the attitude towards employees because it is a maldar petitions that come from employees, complaints, redundancies.
"When you get such complaints 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and talk about the financial situation is a disaster," concluded the President of the Commission of culture in the Senate.
Although it was not presented to Parliament, president-general manager of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, which calls for Parliament to consider a series of measures that could lead to salvation and securing economic and political independence of public television, including the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase calls, in addition to the TV tax, amending and supplementing HG 978 / 2003 on the fee for public service television, in the sense of updating the technological change in the day, as well as for regulating the procedure on control of pay TV tax and to finding and applying sanctions and penalties.
It also wants the release of a provision that would extend the requirement for all electricity suppliers to become mandatari SRTv for collections of TV by ANRE involvement in regulating this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a ceiling of 5% of maximal comisionului in receipts.
Stelian Tanase calls for reducing the VAT rate for specific activities, public television and the CNC from 15% to 3%, but changing the law 41 / 1994, meaning the possibility of receiving budget allocations / financing for the acquisition of licenses for major cultural and sporting events - the World Football Championship, Golden Stag, Eurovision.
He claims SRTv will go into default in the coming months given that the labour law obliges the employer to the enforcement of judgments, even if they are not definitive, and wage rights are honoured with priority over any other obligation.
TVR administration has consistently made efforts to reduce spending on staff and TV production.
"So were reduced trips and other activities generating costs, were renegotiated a number of commercial contracts, and in late July as TVR News was closed," reads the letter to President TVR.
Tanase appreciates that the dire financial situation cannot be remedied only through their own efforts.
"Without the support of state institutions - the Government, Parliament, the Presidency - Romanian Television will, sooner or later, unable to fulfill their public mission," the letter states.
The leadership of the House of Deputies decided to send the letter to the culture.

Ilie Sarbu was voted vice-president at the Court of Auditors
The House of Parliament voted Wednesday to appoint Namati PSD Ilie Sarbu, father-Prime Minister Victor Ponta, vice president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, there were 290 votes "for" and "against 108."
The vote was secret, with the ballots.
PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 reported.
Otherwise, the Liberals have criticised the appointment of Sarbu in this position and have announced that they will contest the WCC, where he has a dossier on the DNA, but does not have the training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu is available 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new office at the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics.
PSD Senator will serve as Vice-Chair of the Audit Court of Auditors, left free after John Anton was revoked following a decision by the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed as unconstitutional.

Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational statements
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned harshly, on Wednesday morning, Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's assertions that Hungary's policy makers are not "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from fleeing refugees."
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his restraint and, through his irrational, insults across Hungary," Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
Civilised European politicians do not say such slanders unchecked.
"His remarks have only one explanation: He lost his total support in domestic politics in Romania," added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a Facebook posting Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wants to attract attention and to sanction the behaviour of senior government officials Hungarians, who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not want to respond to the challenges from the Hungarian government representatives.
"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and anti-Semitic attitudes, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!," Ponta said on Facebook.
Romanian Prime Minister added that is rational and sustainable solutions for the refugee crisis, acknowledging that the brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality certainly will not solve the problem - only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, are political decision makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees are fleeing!
"I believe in solidarity, rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in the last few days in Hungary is in complete contradiction with just these goals and values!," stressed the head of the Romanian executive.
Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, described as "mere lies" remarks of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis, acknowledging that those claims are unsuitable for a leader in the 21st century, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also noted on Tuesday that "extremist remarks and false," the Romanian prime minister of internal political crisis in Romania and Budapest said it expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto was referring to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I said and I always say is that I am against the idea of xenophobic rhetoric to close the borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are in the Middle Ages and I am totally opposed to this approach.
If we can get more, we get it, the problem is our logistics capacity to treat those people as people, not how they treat our neighbours Hungarians, with the bat and inseriatul.
"What I do not agree with," said the head of the Romanian executive, in a press conference at Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government in Budapest decided to start preparing the ground for the expansion on the border with Romania, which is building a fence on the border with Serbia, to cope with a possible change to the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to erect a border fence does not solve anything in the refugee problem and "Hungary out of Europe."
What is the link between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of macaralei Mecca
Saudi authorities have announced that the giant Saudi Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partly responsible" for the collapse of a crane on Friday, on the Grand Mosque in Mecca, the accident that left 107 people died.
According to an investigative committee, the company has "complied with safety standards," reported the Saudi press agency (SPA), the BBC reported.
The company's executives have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation is complete in this case.
Also, the firm will be excluded from the new public contracts.
Construction firm is owned by the family of former leader of the terrorist network Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by the father of Osama bin Laden in 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of former terrorist leader, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years at Greater Mosque expansion, in order to accommodate more pilgrims.
The crash occurred on Friday evening, during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by fierce gusts of wind, crashed on the eastern side of the Great Mosque in Mecca.
Following the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
As he closed Hagi contestatarilor mouth
Considered by many the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after withdrawing from work, as a poor coach, which may not be able to perform in the new position.
After bitter experiences in the national team, the Star or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the coaching role at the Future of Constanta, patroneaza team.
Fixed after a year after taking over the team, he has shown that he is capable of turning around a team that mired to save from relegation in the top one.
So, after a year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 remize and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of the top teams, which is knocking at the European cups.
Things took a turn for the better and for the Future of this season, as the team reached second place in the League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
Future also has the best attack in the League 1, with 20 goals (on par with the Astra), more than double than the Star.
On the other hand, even if he brought to the team with more experienced players, Hagi has continued the policy of promoting young people, and lately in the team's name appeared as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy has made the Future team wanted for teams from abroad, such as Hagi sold this summer by 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexander Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
With the Star, the Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.
It is a legitimate strategy, but then you're not asking to be treated as the seventh largest country in the EU.
The big countries come up with solutions for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the College and director of the Romanian Center for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the police simply means they will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that come with these people."
But there are masses who have started and we cannot return to history.
Migration is a reality that we have to adapt as well and to adapt them to us.
In his opinion, Cristian Ghinea, we are in an extremely emotional moment, in which the politicians feel the need to show muscles.
After he goes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up freedom of movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now an animal created in another era, and which was not adapted to the situation now."
Where we are in the refugee crisis after the JHA Council which, in fact, has not solved anything?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote on the council.
The forecast for the all saying that would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the JHA applies the principle of unanimity and any state can block any decision.
Therefore, things were very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, apply to the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, and the council approves with a vote of 55% of the states, or 16, which represent 65% of the EU population.
Calculations were saying that the votes were there.
But didn't want to go forward.
Because it is a sensitive issue, there were even rejection reactions in Germany against the policy of opening up Chancellor Merkel and did not want to appear in many countries as a response of 'we send EU migrants per head. "
So were postponed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this creates a huge problem for Schengen governance and is likely to see big changes there in the coming period.
So mandatory quotas were not really eliminated, but the topic was only allowed to be cool?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk about the greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are on the external borders of the Schengen community responsibility.
Greece's border with Turkey and Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Maybe they will give up the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state in which the first time, because it's not sustainable.
If Greece capoteaza, you can't say forever that is Greece's job.
The problem is common.
Precisely because the problem is common, it is possible to resolve without a precise mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, for sharing the effort?
No one knows exactly how they will operate mandatory quotas, if it will reach them.
It remains a question: What do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or in Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I don't think it will clutch the European states to take up the migrants: You go in country X or Y. country
Perhaps it will reach some unique filtration centres, in Greece or Turkey, where to process asylum applications.
Are working on solutions like this.
But the problem is not a simple solution.
There are countries who have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the issue of migrants will increase hate mainstream.
The fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who sit in precarious camps and who have just started to go to Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% have got to go, winter is over the Mediterranean, but we expect the next year to a wave may be even higher.
What do we do with these people?
My Pronosticul is that we get used to this problem, we will not look so catastrophic in terms of media.
Vorbeati countries with less experience or higher.
Do you find that there is any place where he really managed the integration of large groups from a extraeuropeana culture?
I look at magrebieni in France, Turks in Germany, they are all enclavizati.
I would not go to the radical statements.
Sure that their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration, but that does not mean that they do not integrate at all.
Remained part of neintegrata that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in Britain.
But simply means politiensti will not work.
To create fortress Europe is delusional.
We have fiddled with the mechanisms of integration into European societies.
There have been some mistakes.
We need to be more demanding.
To ask those people to learn the language, to try to take the values, not to remain with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, and the rest of the family including the marriages of convenience.
We have separated but the imminent problem of these people long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in the long-term integration does not mean that we need to look at how they are drowning in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that come with these people.
And if an intervention in Syria, which I do not believe, does not mean that it will restore the country overnight and you can bring them back.
Up to defend the solutions, see fortress within Europe.
Closed borders, building walls, to reintroduce border controls in the Schengen area.
The European project is in jeopardy?
The European project as such, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and aranjand rules so that the pressure was too much on the countries that put the foot for the first time these migrants.
I.e. we travel freely around there, but each is with his problems.
In the face of such a wave cannot be so, because some countries do not face.
When there are such waves of emotion, the politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long term doesn't change much.
After the attacks in France do not have a more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It is a wave of public excitement that is both ways.
And it is so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions based on them.
We have a lot of talking, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virili.
And, then, the dramatic case of the child drowned in Turkey and public opinion is emotioneaza.
After going public excitement, we go back to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for the goods.
This is the real European single market.
And I don't think the Europeans would give up this principle of libertatatii movement.
There will be other rules is something else.
Schengen is now an animal created in another era, and which was not adapted to the situation now.
Romania has played so far in this crisis?
As a small country, who believes that, if the cap draw eyes and ears potholes, the theme disappears.
The reality of the flows of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or zici that is not your problem of small country.
That is what we have done, it is a legitimate strategy, but after that you're not asking to be treated as the seventh largest country in the EU.
You are not, don't play at the big country.
The big countries come up with solutions for the entire EU, good or bad, we are not their quality.
As he did in Poland.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romanians' appetite for Schengen will fall very much.
President Iohannis says it may well not have already entered.
So move from despair coming to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen as migrants to see us as an alternative route.
What does not mean that it is a reason not to enter the Schengen area, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, Schengen and there will be, but in the sense in which the external borders will become common responsibility, will be the single rules for migrants, single deportation rules for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries deemed safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention on Syria in Ukraine has never killed anyone.
There is a link between the two outbreaks, a game of Russia?
Russia has the power frustrated behaviour.
She believes to be the great power means to incurci Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the financial and military effort of the Putin regime, perhaps that the Assad regime would have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to fall before his main opponent to be Islamic State.
A couple of years ago was a fight between the Assad regime and the secular and moderate Muslim militias, backed by Western and Gulf countries.
He then raised the Islamic State and now no longer know if the Assad regime to fall.
Russia was able to complicate things, but could not participate in the solution.
It creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that can shut down.
But you're only if you have great power and solutions.
The game off-Side is just a strategy to gain time.
Perhaps Putin expects to make bids, to press him on butoane to resolve the situation.
Bids do not come because the world is not convinced that he can resolve in one way or another issue he ever created.
But I do not agree with the theories that say that these people are the invisible hand.
Not to see him on a little stronger than it is.
What a button to appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the social network representatives are preparing another, the "Dislike."
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, reports the New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg has said that the "Dislike" button will show more of a whiff of what feels a user than a simple option.
However, his announcement has raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg noted that he wants to avoid when someone posts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike."
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long sought to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg has said that it is not very comfortable for people to "Like" of current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a death of a family member.
"It may not feel comfortable to give Like that postings," Facebook representative noted.
Version of a new Facebook button was not well received by everyone.
"There is already enough hatred on Facebook and on social networks," commented Atiq Haneef in Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where he was posted with this article.
"I will give the 'Dislike' butonului 'Dislike'," he added.
Roger Anderson, a microbiolog in Atlanta, argued that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, noted that it is hard to imagine that a single button can send a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, is approaching the election campaign in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees have entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary has accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of the thousands of mass arrivals at its southern border with Serbia, announced the government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary has declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia because of the influx of refugees, closing a main border crossings and announcing that it will build a fence on its border with Romania, recalls the DPA.
The move drew a sharp reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday said that the border will be for those who want to go, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said Serbian Minister for Refugees, Aleksandar Vulin.
Before the imposition of new legislation on immigration, a record number of 5.809 migrants entered Sunday in Hungary, police announced Monday.
Also, more than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa have entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.

CJ's decision interruption of direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
Iesean court sent the complaint to CNSC, who rejected it as a belated.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another draftsman.
Impex Romcatel has the opportunity to attack the CNSC's decision at the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of it can then take into account finding another draftsman.
Thus, works to strengthen the building could resume as early as next year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, the technical project should not last long, but we have to reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We expect to see whether the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," said Timofciuc.
Work to strengthen the former headquarters of the Police Chesturii began in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after efectuasera works 4.5 million lei.

Adventures in the stone age
In the opinion of the president FRH, Alexander Dedu, Romania can host a major handbalistica competition only in 2024, and the women's handball team preparing for qualification for the Olympics cost a fortune.
Romanian Federation of Handball, Alexander Dedu, said yesterday, during a meeting with the media, that it is a great pride in the fact that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
In terms of the national handball team of Romania, "the main goal is qualification for the Olympic Games in Rio, but it must pass two stages of pitchfork caudine, first World Championship and the second pre-qualification tournament," said Dedu.
We want very much to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from technical stafului led by Tomas Ryde.
Staf will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, a doctor, two masori, portari trainer, physical preparator, head of the delegation.
We have asked for some qualifications, specifically materials for physical training, which I have never heard.
That's all to reach Olimpice. Games and I will do everything for me to have them.
This is a massive investment, there are many, many money.
But that is the way to make the performance.
Because at the moment we are in the Stone Age with the preparation.
"The teams that we do have these materials and have for some time," said Dedu, who noted that trying to get the amount needed to purchase these products from a protracted and COSR.
The president referred to the FRH and infrastructure in Romania and the possibility that our country to host a major handball competition.
We have no room in Bucharest.
It is a matter of infrastructure and it is shameful to be questioned a gym Championship.
Let's not forget that in other corners of the world have been built Olympic neighbourhoods entirely within two years.
Before 1992, the current Barcelona Olympic area was a garbage dump, and now it has reached a milestone of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the organisation of the 2012 Olympics was a success and in terms of investment.
"In my view, in 2024 able to host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that the international handball bodies are willing to give Romania a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions in Romania.
Mr Gatu went to civilisation with a project, people have given their agreement in principle, but it was clear very quickly that it will never build the hall.
And I have had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organise and they said that I agree and to invite them to the first game in the new hall in Bucharest and then discuss concrete.
"So we have every opening, and the IHF and EHF, but we do not have the infrastructure," explained FRH official.
Former great handball player avoided to assess the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be reserved in their forecasts, as if no marks are back against them."

Spouses have arrived in Iasi a few days ago, have been cazat in a hotel in Centre and asked the tourist leaflets.
Received and a pliant in which traces the RATP.
"Armed" with these maps, husbands visited Iasul.
But, two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to reach Palas Mall.
Because there was no stall with tickets in the station near the Copou Park, they have relied on the information printed on pliant: They can take the ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in pliant, they climbed into a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on the pliant.
Unfortunately for them, and appeared a team of RATP controllers.
They say that there is no longer the service for 2 years and that was announced in the press that has been cancelled.
I DE where SA know what was written in the local press, I'm coming with an evening before to visit the city?
I spoke with the controllers, we explained the situation, they said that they don't care, it's not their job.
The attitude was very defiant.
They say that all I can do is to deie one fine instead of 2 (me and wife).
"I paid, I did not want to break my day visited booth at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!," Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of erroneous information on the pliant and controllers who have applied the law to "blood."
It is not fair, and I made a complaint to the RATP Iasi to recoup the money.
It's not about money, I am not too many, but the idea is that I felt cheated.
Unlucky for rapists in Vaslui.
Have had an accident and remained in custody
The trial of seven rapists in Vaslui moved, yesterday, the Court of Appeal Iasi.
The ieseni have tried the first trial in a nepublica session in which seven young men accused of being taunted an 18-year-old girl had asked to be released.
Before the actual start of the trial, one of the judges who had been assigned the ieseni, Viorel Munteanu, has made a request for abstention, which was accepted by his colleagues on the court.
Magistrate activated by summer this year at Vaslui, where he was president of Section On ­ nale, he is the one who, on 9 April, admitted a suit made by four of the defendants, placing them under house arrest.
Currently, the case is being tried by a completely which includes magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, the file has formulated an abstention and Judge Dan ­ Year tuna, on the grounds that his daughter is in a relationship outside of wedlock with one of the attorneys for rapists.
The two judges have ruled that the rapists in Vaslui remain in custody.
Ti ­ nerii will remain imprisoned for at least another 30 days, when Jude ­ catorii rediscuta will the possibility of their freedom.
Following ­ torul-trial will be held at the Court of Appeal Iasi on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal Iasi, duba that rapists were transported in Vaslui was involved in an accident in Pacurari neighbourhood, car in Iasi on the belt.
Autoutilitara Iveco that were transported to the seven rapists struck a car Volks ­ wagen stradela iesise on the singing, and the driver tried to vireze left.
Duba move from Pacurari end.
The car entered the Iasi here because the employees of the Administration of Penitentiaries preferred route from Vaslui to Iasi in the stables, then on the ring-road.
They have shortened so the road a few kilometres.
Immediately after the impact, the arestatilor escort called another transport to take the detainees.
In short, the crash site was sent to a car at Rahova maximum safety of Iasi, who took seven prisoners and transported him to the Court of Appeals.
Following the accident, none of the arrested was not injured.
In order to transfer to other duba, guards surrounded the back of Masis ­ nilor and arestatii took to the speed, two by two.
"The incident was not reported to police, because the drivers do ­ AU vehicles have been amicable understanding about the damage that must be paid," said Chief Commissioner Madalin-in IPJ.
The big migrations
Romania is not and will not be ready for what will follow.
But Europe?
I say this from the outset, loud and clear: Either the 7,000 refugees who should and must naturalise Romania is, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge in comparison with the Romanian state's ability to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the proposed voluntary quota of Bucharest, amount to around 1,500 occupants, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, even if those migrants will accept to settle in our towns, the chances to integrate quickly in Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
I am convinced that they will be the first to lose their patience.
Parazitat underworld and paralysed by a political class venala, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
Powerlessness to integrate gypsies is just one example of banal.
In addition to this, the governments of any colour have not been able to absorb European funds, to make roads, modern schools or kindergartens, to ensure a decent healthcare, to collect the mess on the street, to create jobs paid respectable or to keep their own younger generation at home.
Why would determine the refugees in another country that is running?
But what produces great wonder is mostly hypocrisy with which it dealt with such a crisis.
We first fatarnicia belicoasa of strong EU states, which are showing utmost generosity when it comes to share troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the pusillanimous hypocrisy of Romanians who, while millions of relatives scattered all over the world, have not yet accepted the other - the other language, different religion, different blood.
Perhaps fear not to steal his careva national being.
In the end, there is a hypocrisy of many migrants who, although only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for the departure, do not accept another destination for the brain than Germany or the Nordic countries.
However, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan is not war.
Also, the simplistic way in which it is considered the crisis can only be mocked.
We have eliminated the causes, some claim, and playing strictly on the book of political correctness, seeking peace and investment for the migrants' countries of origin.
But there's peace in Romania and even more come from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians to flee their country every year.
Why go?
In this crisis, the European Union was revealed as a construction anchilozata, torn and overcome the situation.
Deplangeam that Romania is not able to invent a project for the country, but here is that neither the EU does not have any plan for the future.
And improvizatiile and threats do not help anything.
Then, what is more, if the only advantage enjoyed by the Romans - the right to free movement - could be raised because of the wave of refugees who cross borders with cheese?
At one point, the war in Syria will end.
The migrant crisis but not.
In the coming decades, overcrowding, poverty, climate change, resource depletion etc will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially in Africa, towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not, nor will ever be prepared for what will follow.

Two of fratiori somnifere Tomesti were swallowed up.
They were taken to the hospital
Two children of 9 years and 11 years in Tomesti, brothers, have swallowed several pills of Diazepam.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was a treatment, and the drugs were not hidden.
The children were taken to the hospital "Saint Mary" in Iasi.
They are in a stable condition, as doctors say.
Exclusive: A meeting that break your heart.
At 20 years received a brave but: Biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear circumstances, in the mists of the 1990s, when she was only two months of life, wren, bolnavioara and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same year in which adoption was loosely regulated, a young ieseanca, now a girl blonda and beautiful, the other day in Iasi reunited with biological parents in a village in the county, after nearly two decades in which nobody knew anything else.
Crina will these days 20 years, and her foster parents in Palermo have been thought to give their beloved daughter a brave and amazing gift: A visit to Romania in Iasi, to know the past is unclear.
"The newspaper of Iasi," who assisted in the search efforts of the family home after a few clues extremely vague, he witnessed these meetings which practically sever your heart.
Story reporters, moments of emotions, the statements of those involved, their reactions are truly moving and overwhelming.
Crinei story starts 20 years ago in the village of ieseana Ruginoasa, when only two months.
Then, because of health problems, had to be admitted to the hospital in the city.
Home began to misunderstandings between parents, and the mother had to parareasca domiciled.
He decided to keep the girl, and me to send back home.
He stopped, and then I have never known anything.
"When I found out I was in the hospital, it was too late," remembers apart Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and also then the girl's father, Costica Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman county.
Their lives had to break up.
I have found the Crina in hospital
After internare, Crinei's father went to work in another village, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to hospital in Iasi, and father, when he returned, he found her.
I think trecusera nearly nine months before he was in the hospital.
"It is believed to be abandoned," a family's granddaughter.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother was unable to come up with Crina in Iasi, and the girl was left in the care of doctors.
Because no one was more interested in the fate of the child in all this time, it was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, who then gave it to the care of Bucium Plasament Centre.
There were years of abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than today in Romania.
The Bucium Centre was found by Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple of Palermo which wanted to have their child but not managed.
There have been the love of blonduta Crina, and after some time it had to move permanently with them in Italy.
Little had already done nearly two years ago, how long it took the adoption formalities.
When I saw the Crina, I felt that it is before us.
"If my wife would have given life," says smiling Salvadore, adoptiv's father, while the catch in the palm of the hand of girl.
At home, parents Crinei, Alina and Costica, continued separate searches, each on where he could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where he could be his child.
The police then told him that it is possible to be deceased, but in Iasi parents have learned what really happened with their face.
When I looked down here, they told me at the Tribunal that e plecata in Italy, Palermo.
And the conditions for it to have never had.
We prayed to God to be good.
I thought about it in all the years that have passed, but there were no possibilities to umblam, to find it.
"It's hard," tells us in tears with the biological mother Crinei.
But, even if the years have passed, the parents of Ruginoasa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained the girl where it comes from and that its past a link to Romania.
I was small when I found out.
I think we had five or six years.
I reacted as a copila, I was curious.
"I wanted to know my parents in Romania," confesses delighted Crina.
And her dream was to become a reality.
In March of this year, the chief commissioner Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Disease Prevention, Drug Enforcement Review and Counseling Iasi, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore's desire to find Crinei biological family.
And the search started only from a name.
After the request that we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
Primisem just a name, Balcan Costica, then the locality, Ruginoasa.
Shortly after I took a job with the mayor there, and I was able to ask if there is through the village name received.
Then they gave me some indications, only that the person was not found and sought.
"In the end it took about a month ago up to find the girl's biological father," explains chief commissioner Romica Ichim.
In total, more than three months have taken the authorities to find the Costica and Alina, especially as each was living in another village.
We have to start somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then I found that in September to be held a first meeting," added Romica Ichim.
In the last weekend, Alina and Costica were seen for the first time lost to walk the hospital in Iasi, 20 years ago.
The father, excited, barely able to contain their tears, and hands tremurau to the hilt.
Just changing a few words with those around them.
A week before the meeting, nor too be able to sleep.
It was all excited, tremura.
"To see your child after so many years, it is something," said a granddaughter, welcome and she with Costica from Ruginoasa.
Crinei meeting with her mother and brother of biological
In talks with his face, which is expected to study at a university ranked well in Italy, Costica Balcan told him, among other things, that if he wants one day to return to his village, to come quiet: I can give some sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and to conjure up a household.
It's mother and her emotion complain, and hardly believe that something like this can happen to them.
I am very emotionata.
I thought that something like this could happen.
I have seen such cases on television, I thought in all these years, I had hoped, but I thought that I could be and I like that.
Are very high emotions.
If I could forgive me.
I hope to visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a connection," tells us with big tears on obraji Alina, Crinei mother, while keeping a tight hand servetel.
As he hides his tears of happiness, because in a short time will see her face after all the bitter weather.
The other side, Crina, which he will be more than just a few days, this month, 20 years ago, trying to calm down like an emotional child.
Did not know what to expect, but has a vague idea about her biological parents.
Believes they are young, but now before the meeting is trying to gather his thoughts, because it has a lot to say, but nothing reproached.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are after all those who have grown.
It will be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," confesses Crina.
The first meeting of the family in Iasi
In Unirii Square, under the skies of autumn, the family of Ruginoasa again unites their destiny with their face in Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, high school, after the Italian school model, but can begin a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
Not only borders or countries, but only a barrier: The language.
More than that, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in downtown Iasului, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make it possible to say that it is the first event of its kind made, and that, in the future, if there is more opportunity, they still do.
It is the first event of its kind held by such an emotional, and I am happy to be a success.
We, at the Centre, we have different activities, and are most often associated as an institution which deals only with people consuming, drug-dependent people.
But we are trying to restore the society something good back.
"If I will be asked for such a evenimeniment, I'll do it with a big heart," says smiling Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Disease Prevention, Drug Enforcement Advisory Review and Iasi.
Behind him, the Balcan family, Crina in the middle, of gravitating.
Understandable: They have a lot to say to each other.
Armistitiu with weapons in his leg, yesterday, the PSD.
Everyone pulls the soul
The camps ieseana branch of the PSD have reached a truce with the gun in his leg.
After successive rounds of talks, conducted Friday through Sunday, the first being the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
The party's executive chairman Presati, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the Social Democrats ieseni will send him a list of potential candidates for the party's functions.
Far from over, the party's internal war seems to have taken a break to allow combatants to shoot the soul.
Dragnea has not given an ultimatum.
Launched a very simple message and very present in the conditions now: Try to find a solution in order not to endanger the party.
On 3 October we have elections in the party.
All functions will be available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor, Michael Chirica.
The two days of talks in the weekend led only to the conclusion that nothing certain was not established.
In the October elections, the president of the county branch of the PSD is expected a strong competition.
On the short list of possible candidates for the top job in the party's ieseana branch is Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, county adviser Vasile Catea and acting president of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
Since they could add and take comunei Schitu mayor, Mihai Mihalache.
One option under consideration is the candidacy of the leader of the county councillors and the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will enter the race, party sources saying that he is not interested in the post.
The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is the former leader of the branch, the mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
Under the statute, including on election day can be submitted applications, and would not be surprised if anyone would happen.
"It is important that we remain united, and we will remain after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Office, a new County Permanent Bureau and all new governance structures," Catea said.
The internal elections, the leadership of the county branch of the PSD will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close aide and Nichita Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until September 29th, elections will basically be secured by the executive branch secretary, county adviser Mihail Popescu, in cold relations with Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu praised the talks in recent days as leading to a "partial consensus."
There is a broad willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
Has reached a consensus in part to support a unified team to deal with the county.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions of the candidacy of the PSD Iasi, the list remains open," commented Stanciu.
A judge iesean refused the rapists in Vaslui on the grounds outside of wedlock
Seven young people from the county of Vaslui convicted of rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal Iasi.
Vasluienii sentenced to prison sentences between five years and eight months and eight years and four months today will present their arguments on their freedom, after the court fund, Judecatoria Vaslui, set their imprisonment immediately after the sentencing.
The file was recorded at the Court of Appeal last week, magistrate Dan Anton formulating a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton cited the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, concubinul is his daughter, the lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca to defend Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the highest punishment in this file.
How motivated the judges sentence
Late last week, the Judecatoria Vaslui magistrate who sentenced seven young people motivated the sentence.
The judge speaks in defiant reaction to the defendants, but also those who have supported him, saying that such attitudes creates a strong sense of outrage among the public.
"The court finds that after the time of preemptive under judicial control, restrictive measure of freedom but not custodial, under the impact of the defendants' attitude, families and their local supporters, was felt throughout the local community and a strong sense of national outrage about the fact that people accused of serious facts are prosecuted under a less restrictive measure," reads the motivation Judecatoriei Vaslui.
Also, magistrates were dismantled and the main defence of the seven defendants who during the trial cited the fact that the girl who raped her would not be "the door of the church."
"The court sublinaza that lacks the moral quality of the relevance of the injured person, the issue that the defendants wanted to highlight through the defences they have formulated, as physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," the driver says.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
The economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the past decades can no longer continue in the coming years.
Until Saturday, probably little world knew in Romania who is Jeremy Corbyn.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many are wondering to what extent we can affect the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a position to decide.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical stangist of Labour leader after the war.
Marxist, anti-monarhist (asked him at one point Tony Blair, then prime minister, to the royal family of Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathiser of Vladimir Putin (was otherwise regularly invited to comment on political events by the TV channel "Russia Today"), and the terrorist movement Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to renounce nuclear weapons and out of NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who was considered at the time the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost better than the United States.
The model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, the anti-austerity miracle solutions.
Things like those which they said they were promised and Tsipras in Greece until the time when the chest with the real world and economic legitatile.
The economic programme of the new Labour leader calls for, among other things, the massive renationalizari and printing money as a solution for funding development projects and coverage of some very generous social benefits.
Sure, some might wonder why the solution with printing money is not widely adopted across the globe, we then have a general prosperity world!, but who is to prevent such details.
Sure, we can get those in the blood bankers, becoming a kind of service enemies on the Left, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the Mitterand and Hollande's mandates.
Additional amounts are quickly inghitite by generous promises, without backing, made by populist demagogues.
As well the attention of Margaret Thatcher, "The problem with socialism is that at some point over the money of others."
Few give Jeremy Corbyn's real chances to reach ever prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who however was not as extreme in the belief that proaspatul party leader, has failed miserably in the elections.
And then there is still in Britain a muncitoreasca class, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential sensitive now.
Under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the whole workforce, and extensive automatizari made in the industry to be massive need for qualified manpower, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But, even in opposition, he can influence important developments that may affect us directly.
In its latest Financial Times believes the number of Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit, namely Britain's exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the bloc.
In the eyes of the radical left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation which has imposed austerity on the poor.
When combini this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right-wing, anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that is shaking the foundations of the EU reach an explosive mixaj.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the symbolic capital loss for the entire European project and the deep fault lines created inside the Euro crisis and now why refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leaving room for the most worrisome scenarios.
All the more so for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterbalance to the Franco-German axis (which anyway Berlin is increasingly becoming the dominant player).
Admittedly, the British business, the City, are strong advocates of the country's remaining in the EU.
But Europe today is no longer in the past.
There are a lot of resentment, which are growing in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we had just recently a sample in the speech of Jean Clude Junker, increasingly tends to take major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States in only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And what happens when the electoral support for antisistem formations, anti-immigration, which are at the same time and Eurosceptic increase dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative cargo arrived at higher rates than ever before in the past.
Hence the conclusion that we draw the Financial Times when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that leaves the national interest.
If voters decide to stroke, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us the power of emotion in the current policy.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we will see a greater integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the countries in the region and the outskirts of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States are fuelling populist rhetoric of accumulated frustrations in oocidentale societies.
The economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the past dozen years, generous social benefits, can no longer continue in the coming years.
Under pressure from the explosive dual crisis, Eurozone - immigration, both caused by rash decisions that have not taken into account than integrationist political ambitions, and the ability and willingness of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the EU's internal tensions will increase in intensity and major can affect the situation of Romania.
And it is difficult to excluzi something in terms of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brancusi, farmer's god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brancusi: "Take mature and workshop!"
The great sculptor had a big dream: To be someone, to get famous, to hear about him all over the world.
Behind renumelui or hiding but something almost forgotten today, when we are delivered to millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.
That something has a name.
It is called "truda."
What to write about Constantin Brancusi?
What's there to say, really?
His figure appeared on the banknotes.
And, recently, a bank in Romania has hired an actor to play him in a billboard.
Brancusi produces and supplies money in almost 60 years is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that named after him.
Otherwise, even the author of this text resides on one of these streets.
And, when it hits the outside with odrasla hears the following instructions: "Go into the park, Brancusi."
The country is impanzita of its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works to be known as much of the world, from children to the elderly.
The ability of Brancusi's infiltration is huge.
Neither the Communists failed to extirpe in memory and culture of Romania.
His recitations dot the Internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of Like and share.
And, then, again, what would be said, writing about this man?
Viewed from the pile of books and articles that try to recreate the destiny, Brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you haven't had the good fortune to you're born in any large city and in a reasonably affluent family, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
Contraexemplul Brancusi's life is perfect.
And maybe there would be a key.
Maybe there should be started the text that follows.
With a sentence, no matter how loathsome they are.
Look cretine success stories, which are delivered daily in the newspapers and on TV.
A close look at figure this man.
Do you want to know how to manage in life, how, today, he heard a whole globe?
It is.
He worked all her life to be someone.
Did it.
Constantin Brancusi is born on 19 February 1876, in Hobita, a small village in joint Pestisani, Gorj County, in the Carpathian foothills.
It is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancusi.
Although it came from a family of wealthy peasants, Brancusi leads a modest life, but one that had to collect the benchmarks that will guide the artistic vision of late.
Recalling childhood and where he grew up, the artist had to confess, in a meeting with Petre Tutea, Paris, 1933: "Then life was beautiful and harmonious."
For millennia, people duceau, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything was quiet from one season to another.
And you know why things have changed?
Civilisation great city came up to us.
Brancusi's Copilaria was far from a bucolic.
One of the moments that happened in these early years of life is very aptly for the combination of purity and violence that have characterised the future sculptor years spent in his native village.
It is reproducing the work "Brancusi. A biography," written by Alexander Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brancusi was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when it was plum brandy "cazan," those who own lichidul sample to see if the process is carried out properly, Brancusi comes at a time of general inadvertently.
Filling their causul palmelor with plum brandy and drink on nerasuflate.
Falls in his sleep almost instantly.
The first people see only after a few minutes.
Mother into panic, then the hysteria, believing that her son died.
Later in the day, when the father, Radu, returns from vineyards accompanied by lautari, he sees in the desperate signs of those ahead of him holding their breath.
The party turns immediately in jale.
The father is already at ingropaciune.
However, one finds that it is good to summon the Baba Brandusa, doftoroaie and servitoare Brancusilor said.
Brandusa check the child's breath, then put them under the nose of the horse balega, gathered in the run.
Child stranuta.
World applauds.
While the boy is left to sleep on betia, joy, the party with the lautari continues with more force.
The next day, the father and son meet through the orchard.
Radu Constantin Brancusi puts him on to collect some nuiele and to bring them.
The father of the child with his head down and, with nuielele brought the boy, knocking him to remember.
And, while he feels usturimea blows, the tiny Brancusi is the revelation that the world can be viewed from another perspective and that things can appear around capsized.
Especially the position of the sun, from the well-known, makes him wondering, as you have to admit, if not himself attend astrul's disturbance.
The sun was equally disturbed that his father of what happened?.
At present, the city is not
An MP is calling on politicians to remember those who have voted.
Independent MP Viorel Blajut appealed to the PSD and PNL to stop the infighting and to refocus the agenda to the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a big division and both.
I have not seen anything in the USL projects in 2012 to continue.
Neither highway nor the Regional hospital for emergencies, you see just how politicians disputed their possible sites depending on real estate interests.
To leave a little politics aside, to gather and talk.
At present, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with internal war, no longer have time for those who you have chosen," said Blajut.
He appreciated that the current political class has disappointed iesean electorate, the consequence will be a very small presence in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing virtually the electorate of the parties.
Also, the MP believes that voters will move more towards the traditional parties, expressing reservation over the new policy initiatives, such as the party's "For Iasi" which will be launched today.
The local parties have very small chance and will only break from the electorate right, not from the PSD.
Such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually on the right.

I said that I do not want to in any local office.
I am still thinking whether to continue as a member and in the future.
I tried to call for unity to Iasi and talks in the corridors, with other lawmakers, and I have been accused that I want to make the picture.
I do not want, but we can no longer continue.

"To say an MP that does not get the money is clean hypocrisy," Blajut concluded.
