UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki moon says its response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that has lasted for almost five years and several weapons would not exacerbate violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief urged all parties, including the UN Security Council again divided to unite and support the negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent countries present in the council - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions between the council and the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this intractable situation."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they failed to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 numbers in the polls that show that Donald Trump has a real chance
Some have tried to label him as a politician "flip flop."
Others have called it a joke.
While others are waiting for the implosion.
But regardless of how some Republican Donald Trump is trying to remove him from the top of the polls, has not worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads with a percentage of two figures and some are beginning to seriously wonder what this means for the real estate mogul nomination chances.
Of course, it is still premature.
None of this says that Trump will win the race for the nomination Republicans.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advancement was Herman Cain's place in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And why would fight hard to general elections are legion.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super CAP and economic conservative group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and begin to support it with money.
Further will put some figures in recent polls suggesting that real estate mogul is not just something passing:
The figures indicating support for Trump returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump to announce their candidacy, in the middle of June, a poll conducted by Monmouth University shows that only two out of 10 Republican had a positive view about real estate mogul.
Until the middle of July, the figure climbed to 40%.
At the beginning of August, 52%.
Currently, six in 10 Republican have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative view.
These figures remain.
A poll by Quinnipiac last week in Iowa has concluded that 60% of the region's Republicans have a favorable opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump wins the race for the nomination.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN / ORC, 67% of Republican said they would be "enthusiastic" or "pleased" if Trump wins the race for the nomination.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if Trump would win the race for the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm that Trump (43%) say they would be "excited" about 40% who say the same thing about Trump.
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other side, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if the favorite Jeb Bush wins the race for the nomination.
Most Republicans do not think Trump's temperament a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticised for the insults and his bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters nationwide consider real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a survey by ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
Pass the same figures in the state of Iowa, where all 52% of Republican think Trump has the right personality to be leader, according to the survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44 per cent are of the opinion that it does not have the necessary personality to act effectively and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament has no place in the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When I take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters believe Trump is authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN / ORC, the question of who has the most chance to win the race for the GOP nomination, four in 10 said that Trump.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, GOP voters have not read the future very well.
In the same period in the last elections, four in 10 Republican elected him on Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP voters believe plausible Trump's campaign.
Even if Republicans or repliat to another candidate. Trump still tops all.
Some say the split is likely to contribute to Trump's victory, while support for Trump's will share in more than a dozen candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by Monmouth University shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always receive majority support.
Trump Carly Fiorina is at a distance of 13 points, 14 points of Marco Rubio, Walker's 15 points, 19 points from Jeb Bush and, ultimately, to 33 points each from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It is almost on a par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beat him?
Ben Carson would defeat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation of one to one.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they have been decided.
A new poll by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support the Trump says he does not change their voting choice.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never reconsider.
46% say leaves door open to the possibility of changing the option.
However, the most important opponent of Trump's is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but is twice as likely voters who say that they have decided to vote for Trump.
Six in 10 Republican says that I agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Since Donald Trump called on immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in the opening speech of his campaign, two months ago, immigration was the topic in the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombast would lead to a split between top hispanici voters and the Republican Party and will damage the rebranding efforts.
However, according to the survey conducted by ABC / Post on Monday, six in 10 Republican says that I agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, as will remain and Doland Trump.
Frustration to the authorities reach new culmi.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson outsideri are now backed by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their status.
According to the survey conducted by ABC / Post on Monday, six in 10 Republican say they prefer a political outsider at the expense of someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at Washington.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa's Des Moines Register / Bloomberg shows that three in four Republican in Iowa are frustrated by the performance Republicans in congress, 54% saying he was "unhappy" and 21% "nervous at culme."
Jeremy Corbyn is making its debut at Prime Minister's questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn at PMQs debut has been long awaited
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will make its debut at Prime Minister's questions, later faced with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions that has the right shortly after noon; his performance is likely to be closely examined by the media and Labour MPs.
In the weekly aparitiilor, he called for "less drama and more facts."
Also said he may give up some participation and succumb to his colleagues.
Confrontation will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn in the leadership position, coming after what he called a "shadow cabinet" and after the speech he gave at the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to stay silent in speaking of the national anthem during a service held on Tuesday with the occasion of 75 years of the Battle of England has drawn criticism from some conservative lawmakers and made the headlines.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said it "has kept silent in a respectful manner" and acknowledged "heroism in British air Forces Battle of England."
But one member of the shadow cabinet of Mr Corbyn, Owen Smith, told the Two's Newsnight reported by the BBC that he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around a dozen shadow cabinet ministers have refused to be part of a team led by Mr Corbyn, arguing with differences of opinion about the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences "gets" in the Labour Party after the appointment of Mr Corbyn on its stance towards the European Union and the benefits.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party will bring changes that will remove the entire idea limiting.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the Work and Pensions Minister, said the party is "very clear" in the sole opposition to government plans to reduce the "head" of the 26.000 23.000 pounds pounds.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron faces the gallery in the last decade, when it took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, Cameron says he has ideas for questions that I ask God "from foreign sources" and that he had received more than 30,000 suggestions.
Islington North MP said that PMQs involves a very high level of confrontation and will refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take place at PMQs when he cannot attend - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also expressed the view that will allow others to speak occasionally, saying that he has addressed the Chamber of Deputies Speaker John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he assumed the leadership, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs but a few years later acknowledged he failed in his approach.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, PMQs was seen as a key barometer of a leader, reasoning of how this leads to the Chamber of Deputies and its position among fellow lawmakers, although critics say that become a caricature and that requires a deep reform.
"Framework in Joburg": Young homeless enjoy photography courses
It is difficult to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who have lived on the streets as children have found a way to learn a skilled trade and make a living.
"He was shot in Joburg" is a non - profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take photos of the areas in which they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
The JD Sports says that higher wages could harm enlargement
JD Sports president, Peter Cowgill, says an increase in the minimum wage in Britain may mean "greater purchasing power into the pockets of potential consumers."
However, it is unlikely that the purchasing power to overcome the higher costs for the workforce at the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on the JD Sports expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and criticised for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in "storm" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behaviour rather deserves praise, not criticism, in the opinion of the president of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the most talented young duo set was often called the "Special KS bearing plates," tarat unpleasantly into the spotlight by the scandalous derapajul Kyrgios had to Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a very hard game of qualification play shortly after chair, in Cincinnati, the referee had to intervene twice to split the Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison on his opponent, after which Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put him down on Kyrgios, and I should have put him down on pustiul that."
Although the US Open was last seen making a rocket dust after took crampe muscle aches and missed a possible tournament, upset on Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was strongly defended by Healy.
Teenager is currently in Glasgow where the individual is struggling with Sam Groth for second place after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
"Something that I feel strongly is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a bit at odds," Healy said.
The truth is that it has broken a rocket when he lost because the defendant crampe in US, but it is not the first player to break a rocket to himself in frustration and Thanasi know him well enough to know they were not proud of that.
But to be serious, it was manage extremely well in quite challenging situations in US with Harrison and so on, and I think it deserves much faith.
Has an extraordinary team, has a great family with, and I think he was treated unfairly.
It is a very mature young man of 19 years, is working hard and has been integrated into the team, has not had any kind of conflict with other players, is highly respected in the changing rooms, trains hard, is in excellent form, it is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on its qualities and defects.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take it into account on Kyrgios important station for the match, which begins on Friday, and described a "joint decision" as the most suitable for everyone, but the team has supported the player's return from Canberra in the long term.
"First, we want the team to focus entirely on the station and not to think at all about the controversy surrounding him [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick moved very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he is maturing under the eye of the public and has made some terrible mistakes and deserve to be criticised, but we are trying to support him, try to help him understand the consequences of it, and I think it needs to be able to think about a time when they are not in the spotlight, good both for the team and for him.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders has been reduced by half in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has an advantage of two figures in the Democratic race for the candidacy at the national level, but Senatorul Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is in second place with 27% (up 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most voters Democrats say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
To the poll conducted by CBS news last month, Clinton has lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percentage points.
Clinton maintains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage was reduced.
Support among men has eased considerably and Sanders is at a distance of only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and is now on a par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still an advantage among elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton is ahead of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures, among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight advantage of 5 points in this group.
About half of Democratic voters nationwide say they would support it enthusiastically on Clinton if he had chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it only because it is the party.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters to be enthusiastic about this election is high.
Opinions are mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would support it enthusiastically on Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same thing about the first ranked, Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that it has adequate experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that it is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentions her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
It also mentions the agreement on these issues and eligibility.
Given that the vice president takes into account a possible bid for the presidency, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third believe that we should not run.
The question on the second option for party representative democratic voters Biden call the majority.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say that Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders's.
If Biden decides not to run in the race for the Democratic party, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders's rise from 20 points to 30 points with Biden in the race if he is not running.
55% of Democratic voters view Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the general election, but the numbers have dropped from 78% as they were last month.
Biden is second away but the percentage that is most eligible has increased.
However, when voters are asked what is most important to a particular candidate, Democrats prefer problems instead of eligibility.
Just like last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered by these voters as unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well in terms of a few key features to their party's primary voters.
The majority of voters believe Clinton, Sanders and Biden as of integrity and trust and has strong qualities of leadership.
Biden is best seen between all three in terms of integrity, during Clinton's strong suit is the leadership.
30% of Democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrated and reliable, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion about him.
Democratic voters also believes in general that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideology as them.
On all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion about Sanders.
As questions remain about the use of personal email addresses and a server by Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State, a majority of Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation on the subject and say it has affected public opinion against the candidate.
But this is not the case among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion has been divided on this issue in March, shortly after the issue has come to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy has adversely affected the general opinion about Clinton, while 36% say they changed their mind.
Mainly Republicans, more than six in 10 say they changed their mind about Clinton in a negative sense.
Although voters Democrats considers the Clinton integrate and reliable, this continues to raise concerns among voters across the board: Only 32% considers integrate and reliable, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not believe integrate and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters nationwide consider Trump upstanding and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white ball for leadership.
Of the six candidates assessed, Biden, Carson and Bush ranks first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider the Sanders of integrity is higher than those who are not of the same opinion but, as in the case of Carson, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 voters democrats mayors is 6 percentage points.
Five brotherhood members indicted for killing student in year 1 of the Faculty Baruch
Nearly two years after a college student died during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the brotherhood IP Delta PSI at the Baruch Faculty of New York attacked him brutally on chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and have deferred to take him to the hospital, which has contributed to his death, according to police.
Official sources say that the victim was tied to the eye, had been placed behind a 14 kg rucksack filled with sand and was repeatedly bullied while trying to move towards a target on the frozen ground.
Mr. Deng has accused a headache after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the brotherhood IP Delta PSI had not called the emergency number after he fainted and claim that they had waited an hour before we take him to the hospital, police said.
Found but Deng's time to change her clothes, to seek his symptoms on Google and to contact Andy Meng, president of brotherhood at national level, to seek advice, police chief, Chris Wagner, said at a press conference.
"At this time, members have begun to hide personal belongings and effectively put the good brotherhood before Michael Deng's good," Wagner said.
Could not be revived and died early the next morning.
According to a report by autopsie, Deng has suffered repeated trauma to the head, log and coapse.
"Too many families have been devastated by the rituals fratiilor since 1970 at least one student lost their lives every year because of the ritual," Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, said in a statement.
Fratiile and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe district's grand jury has recommended that the first five members to be charged with the murder of the three.
Another thirty and two mebrii of brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also face prosecution for disrespect and complicity in murder.
"We want to be held accountable not only the individuals involved but, if there is an organisation that authorised the brotherhood, official or unofficial, we will also hold to account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Faculty Baruch denied brotherhood and national brotherhood has withdrawn its affiliation with the local representative.
This is what happens when the Fed will raise interest rates
Interest rates will rise and the Bull Market (rising market) is red, bond returns will increase and the economy will fall into recession.
This is what we know.
What we do not know is how soon it will happen and how long this will take.
In economics, history offers few clues on occupation over time.
After the first rise, interest rates, recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor of how the economy and the financial assets responded.
Therefore, the US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when interest rates start to rise, but the trajectory of time required for normalisation.
Indeed, there are many variables in play.
But, in the end, market players could see that all the excitement about rising interest rate has been exaggerated.
"The first interest rate increase decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the" era of cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we expect a gradual return to more normal levels of interest rates in the US but still small to be seismic shock that all seem to fear.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Several sectors of the economy continue to present how they might react, based on historical trends:
Given that the market has faced in recent months, anticipating interest rate rise can volatiliza things for a while.
However, when growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a tendency for the return on capital to stagnate for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, reflecting perhaps again defazajul in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent survey about what will happen after the Fed increases.
More specifically, in the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - about 14 percent - heading towards the interest rate rises, quite invariabila from 250 days after (up an average of 2.6%) after which returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by Nuveen Asset Management's chief strategist.
Deutsche said the impact on action tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of interest rate increase and the benefits are starting to fall.
The recession is a fact of economic life but rising interest rates often contributes to it.
As things stand, the Fed faces some conditions that were not there before and could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, the gross domestic product will be closer to its historic low point for a Fed interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only two times nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even if the value was 3.6% in the second quarter of 2015, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter at just 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
The interest rate rises in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market players have been prepared all year for a growth decision from the Fed, with all eyes glued to this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in the interest rate on the occasion of this meeting, the term transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study conducted in 1950, all interest rate cycles so far have been in a super cycle of profit growth, GDP dwarfing the best before the recession very quickly after the recovery begins," the report said.
On the contrary, it was strange a slow recovery after the worst recession in the period examined.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed at the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it has reached 74 months and continue.
Fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is more quickly in the case of bonds than in the case of when the Fed changing policy.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in cycle.
At the end of the growth cycle of interest rate, the return on bonds goes down immediately, "Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategies are of the opinion that these increases in interest rates will determine the profitability of bonds in the short term and the long term, aplatizand curve.
Bonds with high return is doing better in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about forcing profitability," Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at the Schwab said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and lower inflation estimates, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short term interest rates have risen, curve profitability is more right, increase the average credit interest rate - has spread and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly, companies operating mostly in the US will benefit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the rising dollar will lead to the rise of their products in the global market and their job will be more expensive.
"History shows that" quality stocks "tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial increase in interest rates," Goldman Sachs analyst said in a report to clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets have exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large receipts from capital and stocks with low volatility have also passed similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), or 3 (percentage points).
The debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a large percentage of debt flotanta have the most to lose, says Goldman.
Consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Those who save may also benefit, although experts do not all agree about how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classics FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Tory MP Andrew Bingham has criticised the broadcaster for "prosteste"
He said that it is increasingly similar to commercial opponent
BBC Music Awards has also taken to the eye, saying have plagiarism awards Brits
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying that this show is not original
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classics FM, a key lawmaker said, putting pressure on the job to prove that it is doing something that commercial broadcasters do not.
Tory MP Andrew Bingham has also sent BBC bosses that public radio station "prosteste" and increasingly resemble commercial opponent.
"I have the impression that Radio 3" prosteste "- although I do not like to use the word - but I have the impression that turns into FM Classics," he said.
Has also caught the eye of BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
BBC Music Awards, launched last year, appear to be Brits under another name.
So, if you are trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that merely duplicate what already exists in the market, "said Mr Bingham.
The BBC director general has denied the allegations, saying that BBC Radio 3 is well before the opponent or trading on live music and educating the public.
I will not be anywhere about classical music you hear on Radio 3.
And its commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important Radio 3 commitment to discover new music and allocation plays us," he said.
In the first part of this year, editor of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that we need to do more to attract the audience from the previous period because the British have less knowledge about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only thing under the BBC logo under fire at a meeting of the Committee for Culture, Media and Sports for its trading rivals would go on the trail.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the show of talent bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for the sum of approximately 22 million pounds.
Understand why there are often talks about the show because it is not original and is not distinguished by nothing?
Lord Hall insisted that the show's BBC1 - starring Paloma Faith and Boy George in the BBC panel - to be conducted "in a specific manner."
He added that he wants the corporation "to find a chicken with golden eggs in our own house" next time launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the taking over of new seasons of The Voice in the future or spend the money that the licenses go on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales registered the lowest growth in August and the culprit could be Black Friday
In the first three months of the year 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
Over the past month has been the slower growth from 2000 to date.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones for shopping.
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November could determine the reluctance to spending.
For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and Britain's commercial streets turned into ghost towns.
Experts say, however, that there are signs that online sales is reduced, the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of the year 2015.
Total money spent in August showed the smallest increase since 2000 until now, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales is reduced, the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of the year 2015.
"If you look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there was always a tendency streamlined over time," said Andy Mulcahy, an editor at IMRG sales index, for the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago when shoppers have begun to use mobile phones to make purchases.
This has increased the number of people who could make online purchases and could do in various circumstances, such as the canapea.
But now that stalled a bit, you could see a decrease (increase).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, imported from America, is listed as one of the reasons for the fall in sales.
In the opinion of experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases ahead of the event which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked to computers to put their hands on bids, which led to the collapse of several retailers websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers were beaten on bargains, could bring reluctant buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium has determined that at least £1 in every £5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing cars, more than a third of purchases are currently taking place through online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After punishing Bin Laden family, Muslims who victims killed in the wake of the collapse of macaralei mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were plimbate on the streets by Muslims, the funeral taking place in mecca.
Saudi Arabia blamed partly construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for collapse.
The Health Minister said a total of 394 people were injured following the collapse macaralei
On the walk on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them on the 29 victims killed due to a collapsed crane at the great mosque in mecca.
Dressed in white, those who are crying death joined along the way to express their condolences, until the first dead Al - Moaissem came at the end of the final journey to the cemetery.
Sad memories kept in the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane crashed through tavanul Moscheei, falling on believers.
The bodies were released for the funeral after the king of Saudi Arabia has sanctioned the construction group of Bin Laden family for disaster, which also ended with 394 injured.
In a ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them on the 29 victims killed due to a collapsed crane at the great mosque in mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, on his first pilgrimage when macaraua collapsed.
Mr Akram is in the Mosque with his parents before the start of the time of hajj pelerinajului annually.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the time of hajj pilgrimage to mecca continues, thousands of pilgrims still standing in the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group would not have had to leave his arm high macaralei when crane was not in operation.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi news agency said that the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the collapse.
Service in English of news agency has not presented that detail, but said the company's leaders have been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier during the week, Salman vowed to reveal what has caused the collapse macaralei in Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the time of hajj pelerinajului court which takes place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse macaralei and Group representatives could not be contacted for comment.
The royal decree has blamed the group for failing to use safety measures updated and has coordinated the work with the weather.
Dozens of cranes surround the Mosque in mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and carried out major construction projects.
The Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "turncoat" son, family dezmostenit in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in a strong wind and rain, with only a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to attend the pilgrimage, essential travel at least once in every Muslim life fit physically.
Authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
Authorities have decided that the relatives of the victims of the deceased to receive one million Saudi Riali (174.000 pounds) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other injuries will receive half of that amount.
The advantages and disadvantages credit conversion into Swiss francs
The banking market have already appeared in two conversion offers credit lei in Swiss francs, the main benefit being currency risk exclusion and reduced rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when floating can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of conversion franc loans granted by Volksbank and Post Bank announced the conversion offer for their clients.
According to data accumulated by analysts financial portal FinZoom, Post Bank offers three years of fixed interest to lions, 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, the conversion of the Transylvania Bank offer has been accepted by 83% of customers with credit in francs because of two successive cuts: Has been reduced to balance the risk and administration charges paid by the customer, then the balance has been applied to a further reduction of 22.5% in lei.
Both offers reduced rates to their own customers, about how paid monthly equivalent in lei before the conversion.
Banca Transilvania thus reduce the rate of 42.5% and Post Bank, with 33% in the first three years and, in theory, by 18% in the next few years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the covresiei credit lei in CHF is that it eliminates the currency risk, the consumer is protected from future increases of Francs, and repaying the loan will be made in the currency in which they collected salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is a reassessment of the property is no longer asking for additional guarantees and another proof of income.
Basically, it will not make a new financial and legal analysis of credit and there will be additional costs as in the case of refinantari.
Both banks also offer a discount on the monthly rate, about how paid customers before the conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the early years is made up of more interest, and the client reimburse very little in particular.
Offer Post Bank with very little interest in the first three years seems advantageous for customers.
Is not yet known how this will develop interest after three years.
The margin provided to customers can be more than 3.25%, so, in total, and the reduction of the cost is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest, is that the index ROBOR to grow significantly in the coming years (more than Libor index - CHF).
For example ROBOR three months is 1.44% now, but in 2013 our to the value of 6% in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days in 2008 exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to appear and other costs, not being mentioned in the initial offer.
The time decisions on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world has its eyes towards meeting scheduled over two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters last week with the participation of 80 economists, just over half who thought that the decision has been made, I now believe that the situation will stay a while and that interest rates will be kept in the range of 0 to 0.25%.
It is a historic event for seven years have passed since the Fed has brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are faced with a situation in which a major central bank could drop to zero rate and initiate a process of normalisation of interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, recovery and trillions of dollars on the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Fed must not ignore the overall situation less rosy.
Warned markets to prepare for an increase but there are signs that even they believe that such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20: 00 TEC.
Stars who lost its charms
Actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has been through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 was battling leukemia and in 2009 lost a life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumoured that the actor would be faced with the problem of drug use and in 2008 was arrested for drug possession.
All that definitely have a cost.
Luke Shaw of the Manchester United player behind the bar a few months because of fractures double.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to the leg right in the match played for Manchester United in the Champions League, ended with a defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that has brought tears to his eyes and will keep the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
Injuring occurred following a reckless interventions from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after Shaw, 20, broke the PSV defence.
Received medical attention on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "Has a double knee and is in hospital."
Will then be transferred tomorrow or the day after tomorrow will be operated in Manchester.
It is appalling - a boy who came to the Manchester United when he was 18 years, are experiencing difficulties, then play fantastic and now something like this happens.
In the locker room has been put the oxygen mask.
Plangea.
I am not a doctor, but the fracture double repausul is six months and will not play in the grupelor phase.
I hope to be able to play again this season.
It seems that Moreno had gambling and escaped the red card and the concession of a penalty shootout.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli has not punished the Mexican.
Van Gaal has suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for themselves when I say that it is a foul and red card.
It was a very ugly intervention, with two legs.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, start the road to recovery, I will come back stronger."

Defender of the England team has one more reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France in June next year.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It is a very ugly injury."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players are never to accidenteze an adversary.
Moreno tore off playing for Mexico state against the Dutch team led by Van Gaal at the World Cup in 2014.
"It is very difficult because it had not intended to hurt their opponent, and to hear that this is a very serious injury, it is not good," Cocu said.
I have not seen phase.
I have not been able to see only the ball, which is moving in a different direction, so it seemed like [Moreno] touched it but I could not see the intervention on Luke's.
In the statement on SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to pass through it.
I feel foare poorly, I am so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado has also come to the hospital after an intervention from Chris Smalling's.
Adam Lyth has clearly risk the omission of England but is still holding out
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but, after seeing the squad for tour of England, do not take into account a repeat of 3 - 0 defeat in test matches.
I would not eliminate any form of victory in an away game.
Alastair Cook's team may have less experience than three years ago but has good players of spin in the batting line and youthful collective morale is strong; it will be marked by the course in 2012 but will have a positive attitude.
Moeen Ali develops that spinner and Adil Rashid, even if it is unknown at the level of testing, is an option for the attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth has left the England team for test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it is difficult to look at the decision not to select him on Adam Lyth in the team.
The seven test matches played against two good strikers, in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no questions related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements have been made since - and I have said this before - the players are their own selectioneri.
Some fifty years and perhaps Lyth had extended the run but his fate is in his hands.
I hope to do more run for Yorkshire will have other opportunities.
Head coach of the England team, Trevor Bayliss, praised the attitude even when performance was not commensurate with its capacity and does not surprise me that, above all, is a team man.
It is hard to answer the question how long is noticed a batsman in test matches.
Lyth had seven run - he and Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was gambling at home and travel.
The only complaint that you had was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in his Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in top form - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
As a team it is the batsman Alex Hales cotez very well.
Is a cricket player who has the "X factor" and we noticed early in Yorkshire this season when marked 236 against us a pitch at Trent Bridge.
It must be given at least the same opportunity as those before it but this will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea that Moeen was under way to open the mouth along with Cook, which would lead to extra spinner whilst four quicks, and I have no problem with that.
I do not see why a aruncator could not hit there and this clumsy player has already shown that is given naibii.
Perhaps Moeen has not brought the success in his district, Worcestershire, was No 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old team colleague, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games test 38 that first drop before entering open in 2001.
Has immediately erased three centuries and has not looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes up spinner in the team on the back - and, although I had a limited contact with him, I was striking to me that is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his young age - with an average of 31 to 35 and kicking in the ball - and believes that it is punt, but there is not a lot of spinneri and selectionerii opted for youth.
Will learn a lot from this tournament.
England has made some changes and the coaching staff.
The Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene's appointment as a consultant for the test could be a master coup.
It is one of the best players and will bring immense experience, given that he played in every situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to White - Ball link of the tournament and will bring both energy and ruthless ambition.
I always thought that was born to be involved in the international cricket, either as a player or coach and like Mahela, has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even when sending messages that were sent and earlier, can bring fresh air into the team.
Beside Colly Durham's Ben Stokes odihneste for the day, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although they are not all agree, coaches and selectionerii are not the programme.
And you must remember, the jobs of players depend on the results we get.
Such decisions are never easy.
Brexit camp could prevail if the economy remains in lull until 2017
Every day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU are increasingly loud in the mess, even without the election genialului Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn to lead the Labour Party and TUC brings serious criticism from Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have also characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained that the last few days - sunken in crisis similar to that of the EU - not all being caused internally - some Member States are fuelled by Britain's agenda concessions and changes to the treaties, which the majority do not want.
The TUC in Brighton, during the annual meeting, decided that they did not want it if it would erode social protection.
We could even call a "selfie" of Dave and George's agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local landmark, with or without local representative, then return home and say they have gained allies for reform.
It is only about me.
My friend, who wants a Great Britain with a view to the outside under the roof of the EU - 'We let ourselves with France, "says Berlin - suggests that several obtuzi ministers and officials in some capitals have arrived at a point where I do not care if they remain or leave.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor extremely cautious, is an ally but has been at the helm for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation to unravel, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), which have been too much.
In 2017, the president of France, François Hollande, will be reappointed or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland Spain could soon have a nationalist government of the right, one on the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland out of Britain - something we do not want them either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to intentionally make remarks that do not help the SNP, in the style, in the campaign for the referendum in Britain in 2017 in order to speed up the process Brexit, my amicul suggests.
"The renegotiation has been fixed" and "Britain did not get anything of value in renegotiation."
Europeans know their skin how acaparatoare Fleet Street can be and how sceptical media barons are oligarchic concerning the EU with scepticism because they did not take part in the referendum in 1975 inspired by Tony Benn who passed our entry in 1973 in 2: 1 ratio.
Can vaguely remember Euro - oportunistul Boris Johnson, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was corespodent of Brussels.
ED Miliband knew the enemies.
Foreign taxes, which included the pungasi neplatitori fraudau telephone and non- pseudo Domi with most major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair I see much the same way but realised that when you are imprisoned in a doghouse with a nervous gorila, must give them bananas to divert attention from the thought of you eat at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to the idea of Cameron's referendum, given that Blair has made a concession on the principle to the EU constitution abandoned, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a card out.
The media has not forgiven him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who struck me as a friend on the back in Westminster on Monday - I said to no longer consume time with me - seems to be at risk to take the egg Murdoch's strategy of boycott by Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but we need to develop a coherent strategy for cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left for vacation on Sunday.
Corbyn's official stance towards Europe is what I would call the soft development.
He says he would like to stay in a reformed EU.
The majority of those who disagree with "anglicismul" conservatives could agree with that.
That said "A Benn, not a Bennite" Hilary Benn on the radio and TV this week when cercetasul in he has struggled not to recognise that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as a shadow minister "financial problems" was a bad idea.
Reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on TV to be unfairly Labour colleagues, without going too far and lose their position in the cabinet.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But the fight to remain "under any circumstances" - Benn's expression - does not correspond with what McDonnell said, nor with what JC colleagues and lawmakers said in the private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to send it - remember, the awareness and me - messaging discipline remains important in the television era, and especially in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to be given a ticket for Cameron's favour in Europe, allowing it to take good support Labour in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell's basic sofismul and Corbyin on membership of the EU - in line with their past anti - capitalist - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents for whom narcisismul small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sofismului on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant about the fact that JC will not campaign for exit - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - Paris or Berlin for concessions from Britain when everything could be worthless?
The US are already quite disappointed about englezilor weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a Conservative government to cut costs, as I was reminded at the launch of British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise the decision of the Department of Public Health England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, a government agency claims that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with links to the tobacco industry.
Specialists in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) magazine editorial team joined told the Lancet in criticism of the evidence used by the Department of Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE has published the report "Reference" last month and described him as a "comprehensive analysis of evidence."
Some researchers have however questioned data robustness and have pointed the finger towards links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical magazine Lancet has attacked "extraordinarily fragile basis" on which he founded PHE main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in BMJ have questioned the claims and base their "on solid ground or sand miscator."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and tropical Medicine clinic, and Simon Capewell, professor of epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
Said he expects the PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, one meeting attended by 12 people has led to the development of a model of a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to summarise their views on the negative effects associated with different products containing nicotina; the results of this meeting featured briefly in a research paper.
McKee and his Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director has said that it had received funding from British American Tobacco in the past for conducting an independent study.
He also validated the accreditation of BAT in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting said the funding received from an electronic cigarette manufacturer but not funding that there are reports that we have received from the producer of cigarettes and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
Panelului members have not been provided the arguments on the basis of which have been selected but they include some "fruntasi" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even say the paper industry funding.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for expertise in tobacco control.
The head of the PHE tobacco control department also attended the meeting.
Research paper prepared by the group "musamalizeaza convincingly" that lack "solid evidence on the detrimental effect it has most products under most criteria," said McKee and Capewell.
However, in the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell said PHE claims that "so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourage smoking among children or non - smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the PHE health department, says the claims of BMJ has responded in the past.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of two people who have smoked all their lives lose their lives because of this vice.
All the evidence suggests that the risk it presents electronic cigarettes for health are minor in comparison, but we must continue to study the effects in the long term.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information arising and those which do not stem from evidence, particularly in view of the high degree of public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Each year, about 80,000 people die because of a disease associated with smoking and the annual costs incurred by the NHS because of smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Expressing clear current evidence - namely that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without its risks, they are only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - our national debt.

Britain's advertisements that are the disgrace of the arms trade
Wanted the film made by Amnesty International against the arms fair.
The deadly drones terrible!
Fiare for crushing gleznelor!
Cluster bombs!
And electric batons causing horrific pain without leaving traces!
The cheerful voice and animated images leaves no doubt that the advertisement for the world's largest fair weapon is a fierce charade carried out by Amnesty International to highlight the British authorities' desire to sell weapons to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at Excel Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign has also led to the display of a large number of posters at bus stops and the underground systems that need a second look.

Directed by Transport for London is not such amuzat "vandalism" in the form of flyers.
One of the announcements parody produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Prosecuting Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more questions and seek to be accessible to the public political work outside gallery collections.
Many artists are moving towards working with activists in protest movements, realising that we need to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against arms trade with navetistii circulating with underground.
Amnesty's film has had more than 100,000 Facebook vizualizari in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP who worked pro bono, and graphic designer and artist who has doubled the voice also worked for free.
Creative director of VCCP, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around advertising for Excel arms fair - with an empty space in the calendar - and thought "Let's give the campaign they are trying to avoid."
They have played with a more realistic advertising but "imbogatindu him with animatii and strong colours, was more striking."
"They have done a great job helping us to increase interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment during the fair," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take action and to ensure that no torture equipment are illegally sold and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the weapons fair comes from within Excel, where expozantii offers fantastic eufemistice products.
In a press release, Saab has leaked an order received from the US military on "AT4CS RS with launcher with support on the shoulder."

Violinist David Grimal: Bach's era did not have world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who work, artists and not trade representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, not only known as solist but less common and the initiator of a project, entitled "strange," as he says himself, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, which interprets a repertoire simfonic without a conductor, and that is to be at least a curiosity in the classic musical landscape.
Les Dissonances David Grimal, founder of orchestra, and one was a performance on Sunday, this year with two performances in the Enescu Festival: Solist was on Monday, when the first plan was cellist Xavier Phillips, works composed of Enescu as nelipsite.
Both performances, Ateneului carried out on stage, showed the public another way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 and, at that time, the only classic musical set in which there is not a conductor.
Conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand the musicians in need of an education is to become soloists, either to become performers in an orchestra - speak of instrumentalists, not composers.
Are trained as "skilled workers."
They themselves are under the impression that they need a conductor.
On the other side of the scenes, for the public, all fetisizarea musical focuses on conductor.
And thus businessul, the music industry, do their marketing.
Therefore, we are no longer talking about music.
So, if we look at the world, we have skilled workers on the one hand, what is stupid, and an audience that may not listen, but we have to look, what and is stupid, "David Grimal believes.
Violinist says that this change in the way that music does the solist came after "musical deceptiilor" in his career.
Was that a high level athlete who had to do the same exercise with different orchestras around the world, to earn a lot of money and to make money and the music industry.
10 years ago, when I was around 30 years, I find this very depressing, because no longer pick human creativity and fraternity in this system.
So, we still found no sense to continue on this path.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This is happening in 2004, and at that time no one was something like this without a conductor: "The music world, extremely conservative, do not want such projects."
"As you imagine to do marketing with a collective of musicians in which there is no ego?" Asks the artist.
David Grimal admits Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury," adding that none of the musicians in the orchestra depends on the success of this project to life.
In 10 years of existence of the picture, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a hindrance in the song: "Curiously, the more and play a more complex repertoire, all seems easier, because all the performers are obliged to be present in the work and not just in the role," says Grimal at the show on Sunday, adding that "I was 74 conductors on stage."
In Grimal's view, the Enescu Festival is one "very courageous," precisely because it has also invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the world's greatest orchestras are present singing and 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras have invited and this strange group."
In a temple of the orchestrale tradition is the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest in something different, that breaks barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's opera, violinist admits feeling Romanian music of famous Romanian composer, so did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu works in his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu made French music."
Grimal is committed to changing the way they do in classical music education, believing that "the musician profession, as it is called today, has a flavour of death" and that "the future of music is the music itself."
We do not need to do the rounds of the world 5 times per year if there is no use at all.
In Bach's era did not have world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who work, who were artists and not trade representatives.
For me, the organisation of the concerts, festivals, tournaments, starting albumelor, all are are tremendous, extraordinary, but as long as they are in the music service.
If not, we are in a system where creativity is suffering, there is freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal has given example of Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before we enter the EU, had good vegetables and meat."
To enter the EU had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are in the supermarket and, as is the case in France.
The music is the same, it is the same logic.
Les Dissonances do tomatoes cannot too fine, but when we cut tomatoes are true.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and the institutions and industries that manage this system to understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If I believe - as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, I do reintroduce its learning in school, I reintroduce concerts on TV and through this education would no longer be required to sell - products musical," Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that is something very militarised, everywhere.
Depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if we form a musician to play an instrument, and, above all, musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, is something else entirely.
After your parearea, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? "Asks the smiling French artist.
Grimal show, for artists, another way of making music just comes from overcoming this status of "soldier" reward, beyond what "they believe are their limits": "Musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and that after the concert out smiling."
David Grimal has spoken of his musical project and his vision on music and the artist in the "Festival of ideas," a discussion with the public held at the George Enescu International Festival by Aspen Institute Romania.

A child's super talented and spontaneous, whom I like movies?
Gives him the chance to be the star.

FedEx earnings are mixed, fall fiscal forecasts for 2016
Disappointing results for the last quarter, shipping giant FedEx said reducing profit estimates for the full year due to low demand for transport services and increased costs for its division of land transport.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55.000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares have fallen by about 2.5% in trading market pre clopotelului, 45 minutes before the sound of Wednesday's opening.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between 10,40 dollars and 10,90 dollars for the fiscal year ending in May of next year, with 20 cents, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts they expected figure of 10,84 dollars, according to a poll by FactSet.
The estimate down 4.9% on average, with entry into force on January 4th and higher suprataxele comes despite rising prices for land transport of large packages or large weight, which will apply in November.
The company said it still expects earnings growth from a year ago as a result of cost reduction, higher incomes and the development of online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that "the company faces a considerably weaker than expected economic situation, especially in terms of production and global trade."
Hiring plans during the holidays were announced a day after a competitor UPS said it plans to hire additional 90,000 - 95,000 workers, about the same number of employees that we did last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2,42 $2,44 dollars per share, below the average estimate of 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit rose by 5% to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analysts who participated in the survey by Zacks estimau EUR 12,23 billion dollars.
The company FedEx Express was hit by a decline in international priority shipments in recent years, which has led to the stagnation of income made by its unity.
But the explosion in online shopping saltat division results FedEx Ground.
Ground division revenues increased by 29% in the last quarter, but operating revenues have virtually stalled due to higher costs for large packages and their own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenue due to higher base charges, while Freight division revenues have declined because of increasing costs.
The trading market pre, about an hour before the sound of openness, FedEx shares scazusera 3.85 dollars or 2.5%, to 150,15 dollars.
On Tuesday the closing scazusera record with 11% on the year level and 17% to the maximum recorded on 11 June.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meetings in recent years, leaders with the policies of the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a table of Honduran mahon with 27 feet to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at one end of the room for the central bank meeting will discern a mural painting of the United States.
The map is intended to recall that Janet L. Yellen, Fed President and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has received a double burden from Congress: To maximise the rate of employment in the US and to maintain price stability.
But since the economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is an unwritten third task: Financial stability.
And this third task could be the X factor in a decision too difficult to predict, which will be announced on Tuesday, and that will determine whether the US economy is ready to be unprecedented stimulus dezbarata offered by short term interest rates near zero since late 2008.
Even though most data indicates a strong growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could frighten Fed officials already cautious about adding volatility by increasing the benchmark federal funds rate - if only by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and the main issues that we will follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at broker's firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, increasing uncertainty in the global market is enough to give them arguments to wait," she said.
There is no consensus regarding the decision that we would take the Fed itself causing instability in the financial market.
About half of economists recently polled by Bloomberg predicted a rise in interest rates this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to postpone, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases interest rates, unless those who develop policies promising that it would be a long time until the next growth would cushion the blow.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.599,85.
The momentum has been triggered by expectations that Fed decision makers will keep interest rates stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if the Fed to increase interest rates at this time," Lonski said.
If Fed decision makers would do this, "should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets."
Other experts have said that an interest rate increase would calm the financial markets because it removes the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Only a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on track to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer they expect an interest rate increase this year despite objections raised by liberals that would need more economic progress.
Although job creation has slowed in August, rising labour market has been strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years and nearly the level considered by the Fed as full employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of growth.
And while inflation has continued not to reach the annual goal of the central bank, Fed decision makers have said a key reason was the temporary effect of oil prices in sharp decline.
"The economy can withstand higher rates and needs them, given the tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world have begun to enter fibrilatii later this month, after China has devalued its currency.
Dow Jones industrial average fell by 16 per cent below the record maximum reached in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy will drag down global growth.
Reculat market somewhat this month, the Dow index is now about 10% below the peak in May.
For complex Fed decision makers, market turmoil is added to the calculation of the timing of an interest rate increase.
"Without what happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, would be more firm at the hearing," said Stephen D. Oliner, a researcher with experience in the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he expected to wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and almost no data on which to rely in the future events in China," Oliner said.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so basically should not be taken into account in their decision making.
But, in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority in the world.
In recent years, the central bank's influence was huge.
Simple reminder of the then chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Fed could "narrow" monetary expansion triggered earthquakes on global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly twinned, Fed officials are expected not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to better interpret the world economy.
His decision making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at the wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, It., said this month that "the Fed has a history of bloated response to changes in the financial market that do not appear to be related to underlying economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a member with the right to vote of the Federal Commission on the open market, the body part of the decision, which has supported the interest rate rises, gave as an example the 1998 - 99.
A financial crisis that has affected Asia has prompted the Fed to cut its key rate by 0.75 per cent in three meetings, "despite the possibility of limited identification implications for the development of the US," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed the scaderilor.
EDF should put the issue of financial stability in first place only in the event of a major crisis, as was the earthquake on the market in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate setting committee.
The turbulent period falls far from that level, he said.
"Certainly we do not want to get in a position to be afraid of an interest rate increase because they were upset the markets," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve still holds the dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability and, until something will change in this respect, I do not believe that we should take premature action.

Four people have been killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a baby boy at the age of 4, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into the crowd to demonstrate against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence happened late Tuesday in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to statements of Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station, and some of them threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said that police forces have used tear gas and fired shots in the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which is known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group says the new provinces set up under the new constitution would dilute them political influence.
Protests have occurred in western Nepal, where ethnic Tharus group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes on August 10,

Weight reduction surgery could be useful in the case of diabeticilor with obesity easy
Zaharat chirurgiei weight reduction benefits for people with mild obesity and diabetes type 2 could keep for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether slight obesity diabeticii live longer after surgical intervention for weight loss than those who follow nechirurgicale treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralise data on mortality," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, chariot she wrote an article about the new study in Jama Surgery.
Surgery for weight loss surgery, also called bariatrica, using various methods to lower belly.
They reduce the sensation of hunger and limit the ability of the body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatrica surgery has proved effective in treating diabetes type 2, but most studies have been conducted on people with obesity zaharat morbida, with a body mass index (IMC) 35 or higher.
IMC, a measure of weight in relation to justice, 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal in the interval.
The IMC at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and the IMC over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate the IMC accesand: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the Min Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan have used data collected in 2007 at a trial in which they compare two types of surgery bariatrica - gastric bypass and Manson gastrectomie zaharat - in the medical treatment of diabetes type 2 in people with mild obesity.
IMC environment to people who have undergone surgical intervention has dropped from 31 to 24.5 per cent at the end of the fifth year as part of the study.
Meanwhile, IMC in people who have received treatment nechirurgicale against diabetes zaharat remained almost at the same level, namely, 29.
Of those who have undergone surgical intervention, diabetes zaharat 36% has been completely cured and partly to 28 per cent.
The group treated with medical methods, by comparison, diabetes zaharat only 1% has been completely cured and partly in only 2% of subjects.
In addition, trigliceridele arteriale tension control, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgery group," the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored the A1c hemoglobinei sanguin, reflecting glicemiei level over time.
The researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobinei A1c is below 7%.
After surgical intervention, the average level of hemoglobinei A1c fell from about 9% to about 6%.
But the group treated with medical methods, stood at about 8%.
But this improved "glicemic control" - reflected in improved levels of A1c hemoglobinei - have not reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to senior researcher Dr. Chih Cheng HSU and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
In the fifth year, compared with the group with Manson gastrectomie bypass, the group with surgical intervention has lost more than 14.2 kg in weight (18.7), has been more significant falls in the value of IMC (7.4 to 5.1) and the A1c hemoglobinei (3.1% to 2.1%) and showed a higher probability of diabetes complete remisiune zaharat (46.9% to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not show a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on people with great weight in Sweden that surgical intervention prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who have undergone surgical intervention bariatrica submitted a about 29% lower probability of dying after 15 years, compared to a group that has tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study has shown a benefit in survival in patients who have undergone surgical intervention, Blackstone said it is a positive thing for people with the IMC under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is where this work is critical, because it says surgical intervention is safe in the group with low IMC," without increasing the risk of death or disease renala, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start -sa takes weight seriously then the patient IMC reach 27 to 30.
"I think we expect too much so I urge people to take this seriously," she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that the bodies have scurtcircuitat predispunandu them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all of the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has sent out a call to end violence in the mother countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in the speech he delivered at the opening of the Dalai Lama for compassion in Oxford, dedicated to studies of ethics for 10 days at the start of his visit to Britain.
He said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of individual nations and even of each continent.
The situation has also pointed out that, while admirable, Western European countries response to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama has praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It's wonderful care for thousands of refugees, but we need to look at long term solutions to bring peace and development at the same time sincere, especially through education, in Muslim countries," he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems, "he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented about George Bush's actions after the terrorist attacks on September 11, saying that the violent response from the US has created a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of September 11, I sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and I told him to solve this problem without having to resort to violence.
I know that his motives were strong but to use force and led to unexpected consequences, "the Dalai Lama said.
Four fold increase in the number of children who have ingerat detergent of hands over the last 4 years
According to the Centre against poisoning in Georgia, anti - poisoning centres in the US have reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in terms of the number of children under 12 years of age that have engulfed the detergent's hands with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the anti - poisoning in Georgia, hand detergentului ingerare cases reported in children under 12 years of age in the centres against poisoning took from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them end up in the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some children drink intentionally detergent and others do to impress their friends or to respond to the challenges of social networks.
Can be watched on YouTube videos that show the boys how drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that teenagers have mixed detergentul with more loud mouth water with alcohol to get a drink.
Smaller children can be attracted to attractive detergentului smell.
"A child thinks that harm them," says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive type of detergent (hands) are the parfumate.
Detergents of hands with the aroma of strawberries, Orange strugure, are the most attractive to children.
Hands Detergentul contains approximately 45% to 95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, few inghitituri can cause alcohol poisoning.
"Alcohol is very focused," the centre's medical director Dr Stephen Thornton, anti - poisoning of the Kansas University Hospital, told the channel Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hands detergent in accessible places and if the small reach them, this is a quick way to consume more alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six year old girl who has ingerat recently at school - the equivalent of four pulverizari with detergent hands with the aroma of strawberries, arrived at the emergency room for treatment.
Have alcoolemia179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Centre outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah balmajea and not be able to go when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors have monitored overnight in a separate child hospital to identify the signs of brain injuries, because the girl fell and was hit in the head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Scott Ortoria Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
Could it be fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use products or wet tissue without alcohol and not to leave hands detergentul within reach of children.

Why are witness to an execution in Oklahoma
During the course of the day, except for a belated legal intervention, I will watch it sentenced a man to death.
If it happens, and I hope that does not happen, I will sit in a room for observers in the execution of the Oklahoma state prison and see how Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection management.
Has asked me to be one of the four witnesses to his death.
The invitation was the first time in January, with his best friend, and, although I was shocked, I accepted.
As we get closer to the day because I ingrozeste idea.
So, what to do?
I agreed because I thought it is a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
We offer a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because usually demands exceed the number of available seats, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
Those elected will watch the execution with impartiality.
I cannot do that.
I sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, I have developed my own relationship with him over the course of months of phone conversations and half a visit that lasted two hours.
I like the type.
Are we laughing at often much when we are talking about.
Prison authorities say they cannot also be a witness and a journalist, so I will be allowed to have a carnetel and pix to me to note what they see.
We will have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma has accused me on Twitter that I compromise impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
The story says the detainee as he wants, get access.
I cried to her.
Acknowledged that "could make better," but it is still think I am wrong.
Richard Glossip did not agree with some of the things that have been said and written.
I do not tell you what to write and I would not do it even if I would ask.
I told him that I can remove from the list of witnesses at any time.
But wants to attend an international report to write about the subject.
Believes, if dies, advertising will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the event, listen to the series of multimedia files that I made.
I will not return here on all the details.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese are guilty of complicity.
But I think it is very likely not to be guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was no sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think that the execution is wrong.
And I look dying from this perspective.
I cannot pretend that I am totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
You are from me as it is to see a man whom I like dying needlessly.
Peter Moody claims stewarzii tried him spioneze and threatening to pull out of race
Peter Moody said stewarzii Racing Victoria or immediately tried to infiltrate a spy in its grajdurile last year and has threatened to withdraw from racing.
Launched an attack against stewarzilor and Racing Victoria's integrity department, saying they conducted a personal campaign against him, the straw that broke the glass as Lady Tatai's elimination from the race because of a treatment administered on race day.
Moody told Fairfax Media he has always tried to do what is best for the flights and is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome to the test for Lidari's cobalt, for which they have no explanation.
For 18 months and had engulfed the words on the statements about spies and did not want to resemble "sly who do not reach grapes."
"I wanted to say anything about that issue and we have taken a long time but sometimes reach such a high level of frustration that everything rabufneste suddenly," Moody said.
It is a fact that has continued.
Sometimes react and must bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have said.
Tonight I will go home and sleep in peace.
I want to go with its head held high and I wish the owners work to see that I work hard to give them everything is better.
From the moment they start to believe that is not the case, we need to quit her job as a trainer.
At that point we will have to think what I will do with my certification.
Previously, Moody threw the bomb in an interview given to the racing.com spioneze grajdurile said the integrity department has tried them.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart was in a room with a man - whose name I will say if I asked - and offered to hire him at my grajdurile to provide information about the work there," Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously I think a trisor.
If that is the case, then we have to give all his resignation because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
RVL's former president, David Moodie, RVL's current president and CEO Bernard Saundry, current Executive Director Robert Roulston, RVL, knew at the time and I know even today.
Should I think it is something personal?
It is necessary that RVL to begin to have the backbone and can draw people from outside trainerilor to account for what is happening in the industry?
I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Others can see it.
Maybe I need to take my license and to give me the part and I have no doubts that the statements that I make now could prompt them to think about this option.
We have reached but at the point where I no longer care about and that is what I am saddened.
I am saddened greatly.
I will put pressure on and I will get to make a decision.
My family supports me and can leave.
Trainerului frustration grew with the cobalt testing long investigation involving Lidari and elimination led him to say he could "to put their license on the table."
Moody, whose name is most often associated with training Campionului undefeated Black Caviar, has labelled the treatment of race day as "ridiculous" after it was applied to the feet of a stopgap with his argila namol, which violates the rules.
Breaking the rules flights.
I must take full responsibility for this, "he says.
One of my employees called by mistake namol on an equal footing.
It could happen last night.
It could happen yesterday, what has happened.
Happened on race day.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment of race day consisting in applying cataplasmei, for which stewarzii opened an investigation.
It is a joke.
People who make these rules do not know anything about horses.
"We all understand that there is a need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.

The coach of the Brisbane Broncos, time Bennett, made a slight reference to storm after his team's victory in qualifying match with North Queensland Cowboys rugby league, played Saturday night, when he called the game a "demonstration" and said that the two teams in Queensland is not too are in wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defending placare tacticii addressed by his team and said that the players are focused simply on the "contact" when placau.
Bellamy said he was gaining confidence after two senior coaches have criticised the team, meaning that they were concerned that storm will prevail.
"And it does not stop there - we have not heard Trent Robinson to complain of wrestling when we have beaten with the score 24 - 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that I have not changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, such as in the last six weeks we have really focused on contact in placari and so I have changed the situation.
Trent has been in office for three years and obviously has a great team so that probably is not used to losing and it was a shock for him.
Nostim as always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy has contradicted the idea of Bennett's "exercises football," reminding mentorului or St George Illawarra Dragons of Bennett's won the championship in 2010 playing football "boring."
Time talking about football thrilling.
He argued opinion comparing their game on Saturday evening with our game on Friday night and talked about how thrilling it was the game, "Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George has received a lot of criticism for being a boring team and time said it did not concern him as black under unghie either.
But now has a team that can play what I regard as football thrilling, especially because mijlocasilor young quick.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He made that argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two mijlocasi that Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because I am somewhat concerned about the match with us.
Six weeks ago probably not thought to us when thought in important matches.
Bellamy has also highlighted the fact that the match between storm and Roosters was stiffer competition tied the score compared to the match between the Broncos and Cowboys.
Match those of the Broncos was probably a good game, I have not seen him yet, as was the score? 16 - 12?
Our match ended 20 - 18, two attempts have been in our game, that means the game thrilling?
Or thrilling means making breaks and not marchezi?
There are plans for me.
If we are talking about, is that at some point we could meet.
Storm is free this weekend because they have earned the right to play at home or with North Queensland Cowboys, either with the Cronulla Sharks in preliminariilor final next Saturday at AAMI Park, putting tickets on sale starting next Tuesday morning.

FriendsFest: Comedy series we have learned important lessons about the friendship between men
In the absence of similar personajelor series is obvious, given that the need for men to be opened is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the summit in the past 15 years.
In 2013, suicidul was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 years in Britain, and is three times more common in men than in women.
In a bid to tackle the problem, the Campaign against unfortunate life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (calm)) has designated 2015 as the Year of man, seeking to question the culture that prevent men to seek help when they need.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted on more than 2,000 high school students who showed symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by too many friends "with a healthy mood state," its chances of catching up doubles.
Similarly, for people who are not mentally healthy, a circle of friends deprimate halving the probability of appearance of mental disorders.
Of course, if the friendship is to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
In this age of communication dominated by social media, where they put the emphasis on style rather than the substance, the immediate nature of the response is often a priority before contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personalities, open for fun and successful, even though in reality the isolation is the one that dominates.
This superficial success extrinseci; the money, the image is dominated by what psychologists call values, social status, all with the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - even more deeply affecting our mental health.
Inventor billionaire aul a video game recently explained that money does not buy happiness.
Beauty show Friends was that it looked on this idea.
Characters were not defined by work but by its own personality, which I showed through interacting as friends.
Humor imbratisarilor frequent times watching football in the comfort of Joey and Chandler's cosy and Ross's passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even if they are willing to fully explore their feelings.
As a social worker explained to me: "... my role to listen to people with the trend of suicide and deprimate showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who come to us do not feel able to talk with friends.
The old adage that you descurci single is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as weak person if speak openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that come to mind when I try to give more psychological adjustment mechanisms in the long term.
The series has highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
However much help objective, outside intervention, via telephone, people arrived in times of despair, long term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if this weekend to attend FriendsFest organised by comedy acts Central, with restoring full platourilor of shooting to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smiling at me and welcomed.
You never know what a difference it could make your friendship.
Friends airs of comedy acts Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - at # FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and help PSG to give Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after marked against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored in his debut match in the Champions League on Tuesday and helped PSG to assert itself in the face of the Swedish team Malmo.
Still will present chronic match and game response.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani has done its duty, Paris Saint Germain starting the match 2 - 0 against Malmo in the Champions League groups with a reassuring victory in the match played on Tuesday the Park des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes at the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the champions of France in advantage although they missed a number of opportunities before to secure the advantage with the gap marked by Cavani in the 61st minute.
Standing in Group A along with Real Madrid and Sahtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions because the French team is not only qualification to next round but also an improvement in the journey to the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
But, although they have taken the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who has wasted the opportunity gap after which was replaced by the team in his hometown and the club began a brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to make at home or in an away game in the Champions League, so 2 - 0 victory creates problems to our opponents and sets a comfortable margin over the next leading candidates, even if there are issues that we need to refine them throughout the season," Blanc says.
It is a good sign.
We wanted to win and I did it, although I am sorry that we failed to give one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic has recovered after injuring a station in one of three changes to the team in Paris, 2 - 2 Bordeaux achieved at home in League 1 at the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who will lead PSG to the next level in Europe and has shown that when he tasnit Marco Verratti's pass behind the defence of Malmo on to incredible suteze over Johan Wiland, long corner from the right gate.
But if someone is expected for PSG to win victory pocnind's fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play - off to get to this stage and came on the field with the new holders of the national teams, with a defence of five people and two mijlocasi defensivi, was a strong opponent.
But their attack has not been impressive, with the possible exception of a strike of Nikola Djurdjic over to Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, the PSG players have slowed several times, giving some unnecessary passes and even Ibrahimovic missed no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then replaced by Cavani nefinalizand interventions, even after the resumption of play.
Ibrahimovic proved much more skilled in support of his colleagues, however, care about him being the one that Di Maria sent in a shot diverted by Wiland over goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored at the end of the day after it was passed an hour of the match, thanks to Cavani's uruguayanul who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic has passed from Maxwell's centrarea.
This gap has removed the hope from Malmo to reechilibra Wiland's score and only a superb stop from a distance for rejecting David Luiz has kept the final score before new intratului Ezequiel Lavezzi to cancel a goal in stoppage time.
The Norwegian team's in Malmo coach Age Hareide, said later that PSG were a class above and that "The game we have played in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, I have only played in the league in Sweden, which falls on the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Jos palaria for PSG.
They have done an excellent game.

TVR has made constant efforts to reduce expenditure on staff and TV production.
"These have been cut travel and other activities generating costs, were renegotiate a number of commercial contracts, and in late July the TVR News President TVR was closed," the letter said.

Ponta, charged with slander uncontrolled and irrational statements
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto sentenced harshly, early Wednesday, Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta claims that policy makers in Hungary are not "with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya and other countries of fleeing refugees."
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost autocontrolul and, through its irrational claims, insults all over Hungary," Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
Civilised European politicians do not say such slanders unchecked.
"His remarks have only one explanation: Lost total support in domestic politics in Romania," added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a posting on Facebook by late Tuesday, the Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wants to attract attention and to sanction the behaviour of senior government officials, which, in his view, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not want to respond to the challenges coming from the Hungarian government representatives.
"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and antiSemitic attitudes, and in relation to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!," Ponta said on Facebook.
Romanian Prime Minister added that it is committed to sensible and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, praising the brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality certainly will not solve the problem - only policies will show that there are decision makers in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya and other countries are fleeing from the refugees!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values - what we are seeing in the last few days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these goals and values!," the head of the executive stressed novel.
Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, qualified as "mere lies," Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis remarks, praising the claims are inappropriate for a leader in the 21st century, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also noted on Tuesday that "extremist and false remarks" of the Romanian prime minister are the internal political crisis in Romania and has made it clear that Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto was referring to a statement made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Monday.
What I have said and always say is that I am against xenophobic rhetoric to close the borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are nonsense of the Middle Ages and I am totally opposed to this approach.
If we can get more, one to receive, the problem is our logistical capacity to treat those people as people, not how we treat our neighbours Hungarians, with beat and inseriatul.
"What I do not agree with," said the chief executive's novel, at a press conference in Targu Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government in Budapest has decided to begin preparations on the ground for the extension of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia, in order to cope with a possible change in the route used by migrants on the border with Romania.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision raises a fence at the border does not solve any of the refugee problem and "get Hungary out of Europe."

According to an investigation committee, the company has "complied with safety standards," reported Saudi press agency (SPA), the BBC reported.
The company's executives have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation is complete in this case.
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.

As the mouth closed Hagi contestatarilor
Considered by many the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labelled weak, after the withdrawal of activity, as a coach, that may not be able to achieve the performance in the new position.
After bitter experiences in the national team, Star or Galatasaray, Hagi took over the coaching role, a year ago, the Future of Constanta, a team patroneaza.
Fixed a year after taking over the team, King has demonstrated that it is able to transform a team being zbatea rescuing from relegation in each top.
So, after a year, Future recorded, Hagi remize coach, 16 wins, 11 and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of the top teams, the knock on European cups.
Things took an even better turn for the Future of this season, as the team came in second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (on a par with Astra), more than double than Star.
On the other hand, even if it made the team more experienced players, Hagi has continued the policy of promoting youth, and names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea have emerged lately in the home team.
The club has made the Future of a team by wanted for teams from abroad, such as Hagi has sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexander Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
With Star, Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It is a legitimate strategy, but after that you cannot to demand to be treated as the seventh EU country.
The big countries come up with solutions for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the college director of the Romanian Center for European Policies.
In an interview with Cristian Ghinea Ziare.com, showed that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and pure means police will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people are coming."
But there are masses who have started and we cannot return history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as well and adapt them to us.
In Cristian Ghinea's view, we are in an extremely emotional moment, where politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up freedom of movement, but the rules in the Schengen area has changed: "Schengen is now that an animal created in another era and was not adapted to the situation now."
Where we are in the refugee crisis after the council JHA which, in fact, has not solved anything?
It is clear that the EC president in line with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All pronosticurile were saying that they had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, in JHA applies the principle of unanimity and any state could block any decision.
That is why things were very poorly integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, apply the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, and the council endorse it with a vote of 55% between states, or 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
Calculations were saying that the votes were there.
But did not want to go forward.
Because it is a sensitive issue, even rejection reactions occurred in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's policy of openness and not liked in many countries to emerge as a reaction of 'EU migrants send us on the head. "
Have postponed so, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for Schengen governance and we are likely to see big changes there in the next period.
So mandatory quotas have not really been eliminated, but the subject was just left to be more raceasca?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a shift in responsibility from the individual responsibility of members who are the external border of the Schengen community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is de facto and Germany's border with Turkey, and the wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Maybe it will drop the Dublin, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state to come first, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece capoteaza forever, you cannot say that it is the job of Greece.
The problem is common.
Precisely because it is a common problem, a solution is possible without a precise mechanism, possibly binding, the division of the reception?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if they can be reached.
Because it remains a problem: What to do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or in Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I do not think they will hit European states to take up the migrants: You go in country X or Y. country
It will probably reach some single screening centres, in Greece or Turkey, where to process asylum applications.
It is working on solutions like this.
But the problem is not a simple fix.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, are countries with no experience as Romania, where the issue of migrants will increase the current xenophobic.
The fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are poor, who are in camps in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan and we have only just started to go to Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have got to go, winter is hard to get through the Mediterranean, but we expect next year in a wave can even higher.
What do we do with these people?
My Pronosticul e that we used on this issue, we will no longer look so catastrophic in terms in the media.
Speaking of countries with greater or lesser experience.
You really feel that there is any place where he managed the integration of large groups coming from a culture extraeuropeana?
I look at magrebieni in France, Turks in Germany, they are all enclavizati.
I would not go to sweeping statements.
Sure that their integration is more difficult than with other waves of migration, but that does not mean they do not fit at all.
Remained part neintegrata which creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in Britain.
But purely politiensti means will not work.
To create Fortress Europe is illusory.
Need umblat in the mechanisms of integration into European societies.
There have been some mistakes.
We need to be more demanding.
To ask these people to learn the language, to try to take the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family including marriages of convenience.
These people must be separated but the imminent problem of long term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in the long term integration does not mean that we have to look at them as they are drowning in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people are coming.
And if an intervention in Syria, which it has not, does not mean that it will restore the country overnight and I can go back.
Up to defend solutions, see fortress within Europe.
Borders have been closed, it put up walls, are reintroduc border controls in the Schengen area.
The European project is at risk?
The European project as such, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
Was built quite minimal and aranjand rules so the pressure was too much on the countries where these migrants put our foot for the first time.
In other words, we travel freely up there, but everyone is with his problems.
In the face of such a wave cannot be so, because some countries do not face.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show they are doing something, but in the long term does not change much.
After the attacks in France have a much more draconian counterterrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It is a wave of public excitement that is installed in both ways.
And from one week to the next is so unstable that you cannot make decisions based on them.
We have a lot of talking, employing many statements from politicians at home under the pressure of being virili.
And, then, the dramatic case of the child's great deal in Turkey and move public opinion.
After going public excitement, we will return to the reasons why we have created this space, this freedom of movement is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real single market in Europe.
And I do not believe that Europeans will drop this libertatatii principle of movement.
There will be other rules is quite another.
Schengen is now that an animal created in another era, and which was not adapted to the situation now.
Romania as played so far in this crisis?
As a small country, who believes that, if the eyes and plug their ears, draw sapca theme disappears.
In the face of reality waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or to regulating the small country is not your problem.
This is what we have done, it is a legitimate strategy, but after that you cannot to demand to be treated as the seventh EU country.
You do not, do not play at the country level.
The big countries come up with solutions for the entire EU, good or bad, we talk about their quality.
As Poland has done.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of Romanians for Schengen will fall very much.
President Iohannis says it is perhaps a good thing that we have not already.
Then move on to the dismay of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen as migrants to see our alternative route.
What does not mean that it is no longer a reason to enter Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen and Schengen will exist, but turned in the sense in which the external borders will become joint responsibility, will be unique rules for acceptance of migrants, single deportation rules for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention on Syria in Ukraine has never killed anyone.
There is a link between the two outbreaks, a game of Russia?
Russia's conduct of power frustrated.
She believed to be great power means to incurci on Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a link.
Without military and financial effort of the Putin regime, it is likely that the Assad regime had collapsed recently.
And it was good to come down before his main opponent to be Islamic State.
A couple of years was a struggle between the Assad regime and moderate Muslim and secular militias, backed by Western and Gulf countries.
Then stood Islamic State and now we no longer know if the Assad regime will fall.
Russia could complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
She creates flashpoints of instability and chaos that they cannot close.
But you are great power only if you have the solution.
The game off - Side is just a strategy to gain time.
Putin probably expected to make offers to press him on butoane to resolve the situation.
Bids do not come because the world is not convinced that he can somehow resolve issues created all of it.
But I do not agree with the theories that say that these people are manati the invisible hand.
Not to see Putin more powerful than it is.
What button to appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have been used to the 'Like' button, and now the social networking website are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike."
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co founder and executive director of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, reports the New York Times blog.
Zuckerberg has made it clear that the 'Dislike' button will show a whiff of what feels a user rather than a simple option.
However, his announcement has raised the question that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg said he wants to avoid times when someone posts on the account or an important event in their lives, and someone else will give "Dislike."
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, requested for a long time to be able to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg said that is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" of current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a death of a family member.
"They may not feel comfortable to give Like that postings," Facebook representative noted.
A new Facebook button version has not been well received by everyone.
"There are already enough hatred on Facebook and social networking," Haneef Atiq in Afghanistan commented on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where he was posted the article on this subject.
"I will give 'Dislike' butonului 'Dislike'," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiolog from Atlanta, has argued that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyst at eMarketer, noted that it is hard to imagine that a single button can send a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, is approaching the election campaign in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees have entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary has accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands come to the table to its southern border with Serbia, Gyorgy Bakondi announced government adviser.
Hungary declared a state of emergency in two counties along the border with Serbia during the day because of the influx of refugees, closing a main border crossing and announcing that it will build a fence on its border with Romania, recalls the DPA.
The move drew a sharp response from Serbia.
Just yesterday said they will seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said Aleksandar Vulin, Serbia's minister for refugees.
Before imposing the new legislation on immigration, a record number of 5.809 of migrants came in Hungary on Sunday, police announced on Monday.
Over over 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa also have entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and trying to get in the West, especially in Germany.
"New" County Council seat sits to pice.
Two builders in insolvency
The huge investments made here in recent years, with a view to changing the institution, is to remove because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who have worked here have entered insolvency during the work.
The County Council headquarters in Vasile Alecsandri Street will come to remove himself.
A year and a half since the building consolidation and refunctionalizare works should have been completed, the works have not even reached half.
A final stage in epopeea building was consumed in the past few days, when the National Council of Remedy's appeals (CNSC) has rejected a complaint to the firm that will take over the contract for the work of the technical project and more are executed.
The original draft was drawn up by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the manufacturer and the interruption of business, have started negotiating procedures without the release of an announcement of participation with Impex Romcatel insolvency, the company is expected to update the technical project, and then a new tender for works to be organised.
"The negotiations have not been finalised but through a contract, CJ praising the proposed form would be disadvantaged institution," summed up Razvan Timofciuc, represented public relations in the CJ.
CJ's decision interruption of direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The iesean court sent the complaint to the CNSC, who dismissed it as a belated one.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can begin the search for another draftsman.
Impex Romcatel has the opportunity to attack the CNSC's decision to the Court of Appeals, only after its final sentence can be taken into account finding another draftsman.
Thus, works to strengthen the building could resume next year at the earliest.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, restoring the technical project should not last long, but we need to arrive at the conclusion of a contract.
"Wait and see whether or not the CNSC's decision will be attacked," Timofciuc said.
The consolidation of the former headquarters of the Police Chesturii began in 2011.
A first work contract was terminated in April 2012, after being efectuasera works of 4.5 million lei.
The tender was resumed, with the contract first Moldoconstruct SA.
The firm has however entered into insolvency, and this contract is terminated, after they had reason to know pay 1.5 million lei.
The work has been done so far by about 50%.
Originally, the work of consolidation, refunctionalizare and mansardare's building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.

Adventures in the stone age
In view of the FRH president, Alexander Dedu, Romania can host a major handbalistica competition only in 2024 and female handball team preparation for qualification for the Olympics cost a fortune.
The Romanian Handball Federation president, Alexander Dedu, said yesterday during a meeting with the press, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
In terms of Romania's national handball team, "the main objective is qualification for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for that must pass two stages of the lifts furci World Championship, first of all and secondly prequalification tournament," Dedu said.
We very much want to qualify for the Olympic Games.
There are some fantastic requirements from technical stafului led by Tomas Ryde.
Staf which would be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, a doctor, two masori, portari coach, physical preparator, head of delegation.
We have asked for some things, specifically material qualifications for physical training, which I never heard.
It all to reach the Olimpice. Games and I will do whatever it takes for me to have them.
This is a massive investment, it is a lot, a lot of money.
But that is the way to do the performance.
Because at the moment we are in the stone age with the preparation.
"The teams that we have these materials, and have them for some time," said Dedu, who noted that the MTS and COSR is trying to get the money needed for the purchase of these products.
The FRH president also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the opportunity for our country to host a major handball competition.
We have no room in Bucharest.
It is a matter of infrastructure and it is shameful to be questioned by a European Championship gymnastics.
Let us not forget that in other parts of the world Olympic neighbourhoods have been built entirely in a span of two years.
Before 1992, the current Olympic area of Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now has reached a milestone of beauty.
The same thing happened and in London, where to hold the 2012 Olympics has also been a success in terms of investment.
"In my view, in 2024 can host a major event," said Dedu.
He added that the international handball bodies are willing to give Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions in Romania.
Mr Gatu went civilised with a project, people have given its approval in principle, but have been very quickly clarified that will never build the hall.
I also had talks with EHF, we have said that we want, that we are able to organise and they said that I agree and invite them to the first game in the new hall in Bucharest and then discuss concrete.
"So we have around the opening, and the EHF and the IHF, but we do not have the infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
Former great handball player declined to assess the chances of female teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare in Final Four: 'I asked all coaches to be reserved in their forecasts, that unless marks return against them. "

Iasul, made a laughing stock of RATP controllers and a pliant.
Patania a tourist
A family of tourists in Cluj in Iasi has come to visit him, but on our hike ended with a bitter promise.
After experience living neither I nor my wife no longer want to more calcam ever in your town.
Without him would have been hit by the erroneous information in leaflets, nesimtirea RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "so say the law."
Husbands have arrived in Iasi, a few days ago cazat were in a hotel in Centre and demanded tourist leaflets.
RATP routes have also received a pliant when they were last month.
"Armed" with these maps, husbands visited Iasul.
But, two days ago, en Copou, they wanted to reach Palas Mall.
Because there was no stall with tickets at the station near the Copou Park, they have relied on the information printed on pliant: It can take ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in pliant, they climbed into a bus and tried to send SMS after pliant instructions.
Unfortunately for them, has appeared a team of RATP controllers.
They said that there is no service for 2 years and that has been announced in the press that has been cancelled.
I DE where SA know what was written in the local press, I coming the previous evening to visit the city?
I have spoken with the controllers, I explained the situation, have said they do not care, is not their job.
The attitude was very brazen.
They say that all we can do is make deie one fine instead of 2 (me and wife).
"I paid, I did not want to do the day to visit stric stand the gendarmerie and giving statements there!," Ovidiu recounts.
In conclusion, the family has been amended due to erroneous information on pliant and controllers that "have applied the law to blood."
It is not fair, and I made a complaint to RATP Iasi to recover my money.
It is not a question of money, I am not overly much, but the point is that I felt cheated.

Magistrate served by summer this year in the Vaslui, where President Section On ­ nale, he is the one who, on 9 April, has admitted a lawsuit was made by four of the defendants, with placing them under house arrest.
Currently, the case is being tried by a full complement of magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, the file has formulated an abstention and Judge Dan Year ­ tone, on the grounds that his daughter is in a relationship with one of the lawyers outside of wedlock rapists.

"The incident has not been reported Police, because the drivers do ­ AU vehicles were amicable understanding on damages to be paid," said Madalin Taranu, chief commissioner of the IPJ.
Great migrations
Romania is not and will not be ready for what will follow.
But Europe?
I say from the outset, loud and clear: The 7,000 refugees we should and must naturalise them either Romania is, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For even the proposed voluntary quota of Bucharest, Romania, in amount of about 1500 occupants goes far beyond the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will even accept to settle in our towns, the chances of them integrate quickly in Romanian society are extraordinarily low.
I am convinced that they will be the first to lose their patience.
Parazitat of mobsters and paralysed by a political class venala, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The failure to integrate the gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition to this, the governments of any colour have not been able to absorb European funds, make modern roads, kindergartens or schools, to ensure a decent healthcare, to collect the mud on the street, to create jobs paid honourable or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would settle refugees in another country from which it takes flight?
But what produces great wonder is mostly hypocrisy that such a crisis is treated.
We first hit by fatarnicia belicoasa of powerful states of the EU, which are showing the utmost generosity when it comes to share troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fricoasa hypocrisy of Romanians who, while millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not accept him yet on the other - is a different language, different religion, different blood.
Perhaps fearing not to steal careva national being.
In the end, there is also the hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invoke the horrors of the war as a cause of the flight, the flight does not accept another destination than Germany or the Nordic countries.
However, not all refugees are Syrians, while Pakistan is not war.
Also, the simplistic way in which it is examined the crisis can only be laughed at.
The causes must be removed, some claim, and strict mizand on political correctness book, calling for peace and investment for the migrants' countries of origin.
But in Romania is peace and even more come, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians to flee their country every year.
Why go?
In this crisis, the European Union has been revealed as a construction anchilozata, disunited and overcome the situation.
Deplangeam that Romania is not able to invent a project for the country, but this is that the EU does not have any plan for the future.
And improvizatiile and threats do not help anything.
Then, what is the EU, if the only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - the right to free movement - could be put up in the wave of refugees who cross borders that cheese?
At one point, the war in Syria ends.
Not the migrant crisis, however.
In the coming decades, overcrowded, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and particularly in Africa, for a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not, nor will ever be prepared for what will follow.

Two Tomesti fratiori have engulfed somnifere.
They were taken to hospital
Two children of 9 years, or 11 years in Tomesti, brothers, have engulfed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.

Exclusive: A meeting that you break my heart.
To 20 years received a gift courageous: Biological parents
Lost in the hospital under unclear circumstances, the dark days of the 1990s, when it had only two months of life, small, bolnavioara and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, the same year that adoption was loosely regulated, a young ieseanca, now a girl blonda and beautiful, reunited with biological parents in a village of the other day in Iasi County, after nearly two decades in which no one knew anything of the others.
Crina 20 years will be these days, and her foster parents in Palermo thought to give their beloved daughter a brave and amazing gift: A visit to Romania in Iasi, to know the unclear past.
"The origin of Iasi," which has seen family search efforts after some very vague indications, was witness to these meetings that practically sever your hearts.
Coverage reporters, emotions moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are very moving and overwhelming.
The story Crinei ieseana Ruginoasa begins in the village 20 years ago, when we had only two months.
Then, because of his health problems, had to be admitted to hospital in the city.
Home began to be misunderstandings between parents and the mother had to parareasca living.
He decided to keep the face, and for me to send me back home.
The girl stopped, and then I knew nothing.
"When I learned that I was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls indurerata Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina City Pascani was admitted to the hospital with her grandmother, and then the girl's father, Costica Balcan, left to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman county.
Their lives had to go their separate ways forever.
There found it on Crina to hospital
After internare Crinei father left to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, before being transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and father, when returned, has never found it.
I think trecusera almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"We have thought it abandoned," recounts a granddaughter of the family.
Because of financial problems, grandmother was unable to come up with the Crina Iasi, and the girl was left in the care of doctors.
Because no one was more interested in the fate of the child in all this time, it was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection of Iasi, who then gave it to the care of Plasament Bucium.
Were years in which abandonment and adoption were lighter regulated over today in Romania.
The Bucium Centre was found by Italy's Palermo's Salvadore and his wife, a couple who wanted to have their child but not managed.
The blonduta Crina were in love, and after some time they have to move permanently with them in Italy.
Small already made almost two years, how long they lasted adoption formalities.
When I saw her on Crina, I felt it before us.
"As my wife would have given their lives," says smiling Salvadore, adoptive father, while gains in palm's flimsy girl's hand.
At home, parents and Alina Crinei Costica, continued searches each separately on where he could.
Father has asked authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where it could be his child.
Police said then that it may be decedata but at Iasi parents have learned what really happened in front of them.
When I sought it here, they told me at the Tribunal that e plecata in Italy in Palermo.
And conditions to a searching have never had.
We asked God to be good.
I thought of it in all the years that have passed, but there were opportunities to umblam, to find it.
"It's hard," Crinei biological mother tells us with tears in our eyes.
However, even if the years have passed, Ruginoasa's parents have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife have explained the girl's where it comes from and that its past links to Romania.
I was small when I heard.
I think we had five or six years.
I reacted as a copila, was curious.
"I wanted to know my parents in Romania," confesses delighted Crina.
And her dream was to become a reality.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Disease Prevention, Assessment and Counseling Antidrog Iasi, Salvadore's desire to find Crinei biological family was contacted by a note from Italy, it explained.
And searches headed only by one name.
After the call I had from our partners in Italy, we have begun the first steps.
Primisem only a name, Balcan Costica Ruginoasa, then the locality.
Soon I had a job with the mayor's office there, and I could ask if there is the village name received.
Then gave me a few indications, only that the person found was not the one sought.
"Lasted until after about a month ago to find the girl's biological father," explains chief commissioner Romica Ichim.
In total, more than three months they have taken authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially as each have living in another village.
We started work in March and in June and July, we completed the identification of the biological parents and talks.
"Then we have established that a first meeting will take place in September," Romica Ichim added.
Over the past weekend, Alina and Costica and saw for the first time with the lost walk hospital in Iasi, 20 years ago.
Father, moved, could barely contain her tears and hands tremurau tirelessly.
Just change a few words with those around them.
A week before the meeting hardly be able to sleep.
It was also moved, tremura.
"To see the child after so many years, is something," tells us a granddaughter, also with the Costica Ruginoasa.
Crinei meeting with biological mother and brother
In talks with his face well rated, to study at a university in Italy, Costica Balcan once said, among other things, that if he wants to come back to him in the village to come quiet: I can give some sheep, goats, that to find a boy in the village and incropeasca a household.
The mother is also emotion, they complain, and hardly believe that something like this can happen.
I am a great emotion.
I thought that something like this can happen.
We have seen so often on TV, I still thought in those years, I hoped, but I thought I could be myself.
Emotions are very high.
If I could forgive.
I hope to visit us in the future.
"I hope we can keep a connection," we say with great tears in obraji Alina, Crinei mother, while a servetel keep close at hand.
He still hide the tears of happiness, because in a short time we will see her face after so bitter since.
On the other side, Crina, which will be over just a few days this month, 20, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
He did not know what to expect, but he has sketched a vague idea about her biological parents.
Believes are young, but now before the meeting is trying to gather their thoughts, because it has a lot to say, but nothing of reproached.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are ultimately the ones who have raised me.
It will be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
"We hope to have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," confesses Crina.
The first family reunion in Iasi
In Unirii Square, in the beginning of the autumn sky, the family of Ruginoasa again unites the destiny of their face in Palermo.
Crina has 20 years ago, finish high school, after the Italian school model, but can begin a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
There are borders or countries, but only a barrier: That of language.
More than that, with the help of a translator, a local Italian owner in central Iasului, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting happen say is the first event of its kind made, and that, in the future, in all occasions, we would do it.
Is the first event of its kind held by such an emotion, and I am glad to be a success.
We, the Centre, have different activities, and in most cases are associated as an institution which deals only with people consuming, people dependent on drugs.
But we are trying to restore society something good back.
"If I had asked for such a evenimeniment, I will do it very close to my heart," says smiling Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Disease Prevention, Assessment and Counseling Antidrog Iasi.
Behind him, the Balcan family, with Crina in the middle, is distance recounting.
I understand: Have a lot to say to each other.
Truce with weapons in the leg, yesterday, the PSD.
Everyone draw their soul
Camps in the ieseana branch of the PSD have reached a truce with the gun in the leg.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday through Sunday, is the first and most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Under pressure from the party's executive chairman, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position ieseni Social Democrats will send him a whole list of potential candidates for positions in the party.
Far from over, the internal war within the party seems to have taken only a pause to allow combatants to draw the soul.
Dragnea has not given an ultimatum.
Now: Try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party launched a very simple and very current message at a time.
On 3 October we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," Interim Mayor Michael Chirica said.
The two days of talks in the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing certain has not been set.
In the October elections for the office of president of the county branch of the PSD is expected stiffer competition.
Secretary of State Senator Maricel Popa, Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, Vasile Catea county adviser and acting president of the County Council, is on the short list of potential candidates for the top job in the ieseana branch of the party Victorel Lupu.
They could add and Mayor comunei Schitu lead, Mihai Mihalache.
One option under consideration is the candidacy of county councilors of the PSD leader, Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu will not enter the race, party sources say that he is not interested in the job.
The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations over the past few days is that of former branch leader, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
Applications can be made under the statute, including on Election Day, and it surprised anyone if that happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and will remain after October 3, when we have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent Bureau County and all new leadership structures," said Catea.
After internal elections, the county branch of the PSD leadership will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close ally of Nichita and Stanciu.
But Lupu is on leave until September 29, the preparation of elections practically expected to be provided by the branch's executive secretary, county adviser Mihail Popescu in cold relations with Camp Nichita.
Contact telephone, Cristian Stanciu praised the discussions in recent days, leading to a "partial consensus."
There is a broad willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A consensus was reached in part, in the sense of supporting a unified team to deal with the municipality.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variants on presidency bid intentions PSD Iasi, the list remains open," commented Stanciu.
A judge iesean refused file rapists in Vaslui on the grounds outside of wedlock
The seven young people from the county Vaslui convicted of rape arrive at the Court of Appeal today Iasi.
Vasluienii sentenced to fund sentences between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present arguments on their implementation at large after court today, judecatoria Vaslui, has set their incarceration immediately after sentencing.
The file was recorded at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, magistrate Dan Anton formulating an abstention request, admitted to his colleagues.
Anton concubinul cited the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, attorney Bogdan Luca, is her daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca is defending Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the biggest punishment in this file.
How have motivated judges sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate judecatoria Vaslui convicted the seven young people has motivated the sentence.
In motivation Judge discusses the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who have supported them, adding that such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among the public.
"The court finds that after the post under judicial control, restrictive measure preventive measure of freedom but not custodial of freedom, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and supporters of locals, was felt in the local community and a strong sense of national outrage over the fact that people accused of serious crimes are prosecuted under a less restrictive measure," the motivation said Judecatoriei Vaslui.
Magistrates have also dismantled the main defence of the seven defendants during the trial also cited the fact that the girl who raped her would not be "the door of the church."
"Court sublinaza that lacks the moral quality of the injured person, something which the defendants wanted to highlight relevance through probe we have formulated, as a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," states in motivation.
Corbyn, the Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in recent decades can no longer continue in the same way in the coming years.
Until Saturday probably little world knew in Romania who is Jeremy Corbyn.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many are wondering to what extent we can affect the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a position of decision.
Jeremy Corbyn is Labour's most radical stangist leader after the war.
Marxist said, anti - monarhist (asked at one point Tony Blair, the then prime minister, to take the royal family of Buckingam Palace), an anti American rude and a sympathiser of Vladimir Putin's (was in fact regularly invited to comment on political events by the TV channel "Russia Today"), and Hizbollah and Hamas terrorist movements, he wants Britain to renounce nuclear weapons and to get out of NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, considered at the time of the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
After all model demagogilor populists, Corbyn has, of course, miracle solutions against austerity.
Things of the kind which they said they promised and Tsipras in Greece until economic legitatile shook his chest with the real world.
Economic programme of the new Labour leader provides, among other things, renationalizari and massive money printing as a solution for funding development projects and coverage of very generous social benefits.
Sure, some might ask why the solution with printing money is not widely adopted across the globe, we then have a general prosperity world!, but who can also prevent such details.
Sure, we can tax them to the blood bankers, becoming a kind of service enemies of the left, but as has been seen many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterand and Hollande.
Additional sums are quickly selling inghitite generous promises, made by the demagogues populists.
As well lured the attention of Margaret Thatcher, "the problem with socialism is that at some point the money ends of others."
Few give Jeremy Corbyn's real opportunities to get ever prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, which in any case was not as extreme in the belief that he party leader, has failed miserably in the elections.
And then there is still a class in Britain muncitoreasca, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And unions were sensitive as influential as now.
In the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the workforce and extensive automatizari have done for the industry to be massively need highly qualified manpower, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
However, even in opposition, he can influence important developments that may affect us directly.
In his latest number Financial Times believes that Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit, namely Britain's exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the bloc.
In the eyes of the radical left Brussels is the international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed austerity to the poor.
When combini this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, anti - immigration rhetoric and you look at the refugee crisis shaking the foundations of the EU reach an explosive mixaj.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide in the wake of the referendum, which would take place by 2017, the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and deep fault lines created within it the Euro crisis and now that of refugees to leave the Union, between North and South, between East and West, leaves room for the most worrisome scenarios.
All the more so because for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterbalance to the Franco - German axis (in which Berlin is increasingly becoming the dominant player anyway).
It is true, the British business, the City, are powerful lawyers of the country's backwardness in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer that of the past.
There is much resentment, which increase in intensity even during these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we just recently had a sample in his speech Jean Clude Junker, an increasing trend to make major decisions over the head the vast majority of Member States consulting with only a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And this is what happens when the electoral support for anti - immigration antisistem formations, which are at the same time and eurosceptic increases dramatically throughout the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative cargo arrived at higher rates than at any other time in the past.
Hence, the conclusion drawn by the Financial Times when evaluating Brexit's chances.
The pro EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from the national interest.
If voters decide brain, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory recalls the excitement in the current policy.
Now, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as one would expect, we will see a greater integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the countries in the region and on the outskirts of Europe's interest and that of the decision process.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States fuels populist rhetoric of accumulated frustrations in oocidentale societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in recent decades, generous social benefits, can no longer continue in the same way in the coming years.
Under pressure from explosive dual crisis, Euro zone - immigration, both caused by rash decisions that have not taken into account than integrationiste political ambitions, not the peoples and governments in Europe and the ability and willingness to respond to such challenges, the turmoil on the continent, the EU's internal tensions will increase in intensity and can affect major Romania's situation.
And it is hard to excluzi something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brancusi, god farmer.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brancusi: "Take and mature workshop!"
The great sculptor had a big dream: To be someone, to get famous, to hear about him all over the world.
Behind renumelui or hiding but something almost forgotten today, when we are delivered millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.
Something has a name.
Is "truda."
What to write about Constantin Brancusi?
What's there to say, really?
His figure appeared on banknotes.
And, recently, a known bank in Romania has hired an actor to play him in a promotional today.
Brancusi produces and supplies money for nearly 60 years now is no longer with us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and bulevarde that bears her name.
In fact, even the author of this piece lives in one of these streets.
And, when out on the outside with odrasla, hears the following instructions: "Go to the park, to Brancusi."
The country is impanzita its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works to be known to all the world, from children to the elderly.
Brancusi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Neither the Communists failed to extirpe in Romania's memory and culture.
Quotations his plaster the Internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of Like ATMs and share sites.
And, then, again, what would be said and written about this man?
Viewed from the total pile of books and articles trying to recreate his destiny, Brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell me that if you have not had the good fortune to be nasti in any large city and in a reasonably affluent family, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
Brancusi's life is perfect contraexemplul.
And perhaps there would be a key.
Perhaps this should be started the text that follows.
In a sentence, no matter how loathsome they are.
Forget cretine success stories, which are delivered on a daily basis in the newspapers and on TV.
Look carefully at the pinnacle of this man.
You want to know how to succeed in life, how, today, he heard an entire world?
It is simple.
Has worked all their lives to be someone.
That did.
Constantin Brancusi was born on 19 February 1876 in Hobita, a small village in common Pestisani Gorj County, in the foothills of the Carpathians.
Is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae's Brancusi.
Although it came from a family of wealthy peasants, Brancusi leads a modest life, but one that would reap their benchmarks that will guide the artistic vision of the night.
Remembering childhood and places where grew, the artist had to marturiseasca, at a meeting with Petre Tutea, from Paris, in 1933: "Then life was beautiful and harmonious."
For millennia, people did, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything passed down from one season to the next.
And you know why things have changed?
The great city civilisation has come to us.
However, Brancusi's childhood was far from a bucolic one.
One of times in those early years of life is extremely revealing for the combination of purity and violence that have characterised the years spent in the home future sculptor.
Time is reproduced in the work "Brancusi. A biography," written by Alexander Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brancusi had 3 years.
In the autumn of that year, when it was the plum "boiler," those who sample lichidul watching them to see if the process is carried out properly, Brancusi catch a moment's inadvertently overall.
Fill their causul palmelor with plum and drink on nerasuflate.
Falls in his sleep almost instantly.
The first people to notice only after a few minutes.
Mother panic, then in hysteria, believing that her son died.
Late in the afternoon, when the father, Radu, returns from alive with lautari, he sees in the desperate signs of those that await him away with my heart in the mouth.
The party immediately turns in jale.
Father already thinks the ingropaciune.
However, one finds that it is better to summon Baba Brandusa Brancusilor doftoroaie and servants.
Brandusa check the child's breath, then put them under the nose of horse balega, gathered around.
Child stranuta strong.
The world applauds.
While the boy is left to sleep further betia lautari, of joy, the party continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet by grove.
Radu Constantin Brancusi put it to collect some nuiele and to bring them.
Their father explains the child with head down and, with nuielele brought the boy, knocking him to remember.
And, while feeling usturimea coups, the tiny Brancusi's revelation that the world can also be seen from another perspective, and that things can appear around you by.
Especially the sun, different from the well known, makes him wonder, as have to recognise in old age, whether astrul himself attend his trepidation.
The sun may have been equally disturbed that his father of what had happened?.
At present, the city is not working
An MP is calling on politicians to remember those who voted them.
Independent deputy Viorel Blajut appealed to the PSD and the PNL to stop the infighting and refocus the agenda for the electorate.
What we are seeing now on our political scene is a great divide, and that is that.
I have not seen anything in the USL projects in 2012 to continue.
Neither highway nor Urgente Regional hospital, just see how politicians dispute their possible locations in terms of real estate interests.
Let a little politics aside, let us gather and talk.
At present, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with domestic war, no longer have time for those who chose you," Blajut said.
He said that the current political class has disappointed voters iesean, the result would be a very small presence at the upcoming local elections, around 30 per cent figure, which is basically faithful to the party's electorate.
He also believes that voters will direct all for traditional parties, voicing reserve of new policy initiatives such as "For Iasi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will simply break in the electorate right, not in the PSD.
Such parties are based on people active civic, which are usually on the right.
"It faramiteaza further right, which is not good for anyone, neither for the PSD," Blajut said.
He said he is not interested in a bid to the upcoming local elections, denying rumours about his intention to join the race for City Hall.
I said that I do not want to run at any local office.
I still think if a mandate to continue as a Member and in the future.
I tried to call for unity in Iasi and in discussions in the hallways, with other lawmakers, and I have been accused that I want to make my picture.
I do not want, but we cannot continue this way.
"If people voted for us, does not mean they are stupid to vote if you do not see anything," said Blajut alesilor, who said that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is hypocrisy.
A colleague in Tatarasi said he does not get the money and we have to go by bus.
Let us not be hypocritical.
There is little money.
Sometimes I am ashamed to raise money from casierie.
At the end of the mandate I will make a report with everything I have spent outside employee salaries from the cabinet and its maintenance.
Happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lei, although deconturile of transport, accommodation and other.
"To tell an MP that does not get them clean money is hypocrisy," concluded Blajut.
