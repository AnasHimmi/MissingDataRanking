UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that has lasted for nearly five years, and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief has again called on all sides, including the divided UN Security Council to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on Wednesday at a conference that he plans to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present in the council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this difficult situation."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures in polls showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a "fridge-flop" politician.
Others called him a joke.
And others await the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to remove Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump leads with a percentage of two figures and some are starting to question seriously what this means for the chances of the real estate mogul's appointment.
Of course, it is still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for the Republicans' nomination.
Pundits shows that in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's lead was taking place to Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why it would struggle hard at the general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth acknowledge Trump's power and are starting to support him with money.
We continue to present some figures from recent polls suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just something passing:
Figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy, in mid-June, a poll by the University of Monmouth shows that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage climbed to 40 per cent.
In early August, it was 52 per cent.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
Those numbers remain.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a poll conducted by CNN / ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump would win the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say they would be "excited" about 40 per cent who say the same about Trump).
Closest to the excitement?
Marco Rubio, with just 21 per cent.
On the other side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "unhappy" or "upset" if Jeb Bush's favorite wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament a problem.
While Donald Trump has been strongly criticised for his insults and his bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to ABC News / Washington Post's poll on Monday.
The Kings are the same figures in the state of Iowa, where all 52 percent of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be ruler, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44 per cent say he doesn't have the personality needed to act effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament does not have what he is looking for at the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are enjoying the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters believe Trump is authentic.
According to a CNN / ORC poll last week, at the question of who has the most chance to win the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed to the end of July when four out of 10 would have gambled on Jeb Bush.
Full information: In the past, GOP voters didn't read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry in the nomination race, versus only 28 percent for Mitt Romney.
But these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if Republicans or replay for another candidate, Trump is still at the top of all.
Some say the divided situation is likely to contribute to Trump's victory, while prop Donald Trump will split up to more than a dozen candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, almost always Trump will benefit from majority support.
Trump is at the distance of 13 points by Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, at 15 points of Walker, at 19 points at Jeb Bush and finally, at 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one showdown.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they have decided.
A new poll by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they don't change their voting option.
Obviously, much can happen in this regard, and no one can say that they will never change.
46 per cent say it leaves the window open to the possibility of changing their choice.
However, Trump's most important contender is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely that voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign's opening speech two months ago, immigration was the focus of the 2016 campaign.
Some are Instagram that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between prominent evangelical voters and the Republican Party and will harm the Lib Dems.
But according to the ABC / Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
The ASA, however, seems as long as the issue of immigration remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities is reaching new cull.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now backed by nearly half of Republican voters, largely thanks to their status of outfits.
According to the ABC / Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider at the expense of someone with experience in government.
People are also upset by Washington.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Sharks / Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the leaders of the Republicans in the congress, with 54 per cent declaring themselves "unhappy" and 21 per cent "nervous and cull."
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister 's
Ever since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has long been expected
Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will later make his debut at Prime Minister 's', facing the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of six questions he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.
In the weekly appearances, he called for "less theatre and more facts."
He also said he can drop a few extras and give them to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in a leadership position, coming after he called a "ghost cabinet" and after his speech Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to keep quiet at the rosse of the national anthem at a service held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the England battle drew criticism from conservative MPs and held the front page of the headlines.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he "kept quiet respectfully" and acknowledged "the heroism of British air forces in the Battle of England."
But a member of Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Chapo 's Newsnight that it would have recommended the Labour leader sing the national anthem "no matter" of his faith that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around a dozen ministers from the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leading team, arguing through differences of opinion on the economy, defence and foreign, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party backed him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says the political differences "get stuck" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment on his position towards the European Union and the benefits limit.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would bring changes to which it would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
Hours later, Mr Smith, Labour and Pennings Minister, said the party "is very clear" in exclusive opposition to government plans to cut the "head" level from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader facing David Cameron on the floor in the last decade since he took the helm of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from foreign sources" for questions to ask Mr Cameron and that he has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
MP Islington North said PMQs involve a level of confrontation too high and that it would refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the finance minister, would hold her seat at PMQs when he can't attend - for example when Mr Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying he approached House of Deputies Speaker John Berkeley to discuss the issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs but admitted several years later that he had failed in his work.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, of how he heads the Chamber of Deputies and his position among fellow MPs, although critics say he has become a caricature and that he needs deep reform.
"Frame in Glastonbury": Homeless youths benefit from photo courses
It's difficult to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way of learning a profession and earning their living.
"I Were in the Graduate" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people to take photos of the areas where they live and earn money from that.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports boss says higher wages could harm expansion
JD Sports chairman Peter Canngill says an increase in the minimum wage in the UK could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that that purchasing power will exceed higher labour costs within the firm, he says.
Costs could impact JD Sports's expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticised for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral victim in the "storm" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behaviour deserves more words of praise and not criticism, in the opinion of Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented dude often called "Special KS," has been dragged into the spotlight by the scandalous knee injury that Kyrgios had with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fierce qualifying match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice to beat Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after whom Harrison said: "The Eagles should have put him to the knees of Kyrgios, and I should have put him on the footy."
Although he was last seen making a powder after he had cramps and missed a possible U.S. Open, upset Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was vigorously defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow where he is battling Sam Groth for second spot after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
"One thing I feel strongly is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was attracted a bit in the conflict," Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused the crampe in the U.S., but he is not the first player to break a rocket from frustration towards himself and I know Thanasi enough to know that they wouldn't be proud of that.
But let's be serious, he has mastered extremely well in pretty challenging situations in the U.S. with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of confidence.
He has an extraordinary team, he has a great family alongside and I think he was treated unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, working hard and integrated into the team, he hasn't had any clash with the other players, he's very respected at the Broncos, he trains hard, he's in excellent form, he's a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and faults.
Healy also backed the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the key replay game, which starts on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most suited to all, but he supported the return of the player originally from Canberra in the long run in the team.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the replay game and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick has climbed very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he's matured under the eyes of the public and made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticised, but we're trying to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his deeds and I think he needs a while not in the spotlight to be able to reflect, good thing for both the team and him.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernie Sanders has shrunk to half in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-figure advantage in the Democratic race for national candidacy, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now backed by 47 per cent of Democratic voters (down from 58 per cent) while Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will run for president, is backed by 15 per cent of Democratic voters.
With at least five months before the start of the primary election, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more decisive in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
Against the poll conducted by CBS News last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has dwindled.
Support among men has narrowed considerably and Sanders is at a distance of just 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now on par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in the edge among older voters.
Last month, Clinton stands in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures, among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a slight 5-point lead in this group.
About half of Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she was elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would argue it somewhat reserved, and another 15 per cent would only support it because it represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters are excited about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who don't currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about the first-placed, Donald Trump (35 per cent) is lower.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that he has the right experience (16 per cent), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for the post (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
With the vice president considering a possible presidential bid, 57 per cent of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third think he shouldn't run.
At the question of the second option for the party's representative, Democratic voters call him a majority Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second option, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic party race, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders is growing, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he is not running.
55 per cent of Democratic voters consider Clinton the highest chance to win the general election; but the numbers have fallen from 78 per cent as they were last month.
Biden is at the distance of the second, but the percentage that he is most eligible has risen.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer the issues instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters as unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well in a few key features to their party's primary voters.
Most voters see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as integral and trustworthy and with solid leadership qualities.
Biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strong point is leadership.
30 percent of Democratic voters don't think H. Clinton is integrated and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent don't have a view of him on that.
Democratic voters also believe in general that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
On all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters don't have a view of Sanders.
How questions persist about the use of a personal email address and a message by Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are happy with her explanation on the subject and say she has not affected her general opinion on the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with their explanation, while only nearly a third are happy.
Public opinion split in March on the subject shortly after the issue came out.
Most Americans say that the controversy over the email has not affected the general opinion about Clinton, although 36 percent say they have changed their mind in negative sense.
Mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their mind about Clinton in negative sense.
While Democratic voters consider Clinton mainstream and trustworthy, this issue continues to raise concerns among voters at the general level: Only 32 per cent consider it to be integrated and trustworthy, with 8 per cent fewer than last month and 15 per cent fewer than in May.
62% of voters do not see it as reliable and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 per cent of voters at national level do not see Trump as trustworthy and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have been white for leadership.
Of the six candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who see Sanders is bigger than those who disagree, though, as in Carson's case, many don't have a view of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 51 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five gang members charged over murder of student in Year 1 at Barbour faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta PSI fraternity at the New York Faculty of Baruch brutally attacked the chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed taking him to hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was linked to the eye, was put in the back of a 14-kg backpack filled with sand and was handcuffed repeatedly while trying to head towards a target, on a frozen ground.
Mr. Deng charged headaches after losing consciousness.
Members of the PPI Delta PSI did not call the emergency number after it fainted and claim they would have waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.
But they found the time needed to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the fraternity at national level, to ask her advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, members began to hide personal belongings and effectively put the good of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng's good," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the second day in the morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, trending and couch.
"Too many families have been devastated by the rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost their lives every year due to rituals," Douglas Blackberg, the lawyer for Deng's family, said in a statement.
The brotherhood and their members must be held accountable, and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The grand jury of the Monroe District recommended that the first five members be charged with murder of degree three.
Thirty-two vertebrates of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged for unconscious and abetting murder.
"We want to draw responsibility not only to the people involved but, if there is an organisation that has authorised the Brotherhood, officially or informally, we will also draw it to account," Wagner said at a press conference Tuesday.
The Baruch faculty banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representative.
What will happen when the Fed raises interest rate
The interest rate will rise and the Bull market (rising market) will sink, bond profitability will rise and the economy will fall into recession.
That is what we know.
What we do not know is how long it will happen and how long it will take.
In the economy, history offers few clues on the time.
After the first rate hike, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The federal Reserve's aggressiveness to raise interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets have responded.
That is why the central bank officials in the US have so strongly emphasised that investors should not focus on the moment when it starts to raise interest rates but on the trajectories of the time needed for normalisation.
Indeed, there are multiple variables in the game.
But in the end, market players could find that all the hype over the interest rate hike has been exaggerated.
"The first rate hike decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era of" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the US to more normal but still small levels to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to present the way in which several sectors of the economy could react, relying on historical trends:
Given the situation that the market has experienced in recent months, anticipation of an interest rate hike may have wiped out a while.
But at the time the impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a tendency for capital profitability to falter for 12-24 months after the first increase, which reflects once again the defect in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent survey on what would happen after Fed increases.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by about 14 percent - heading towards an interest rate rise, rather flammable in the 250-day period after (an average of 2.6 per cent) after returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 per cent, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by chief strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said the impact on shares tend to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle and benefits start to fall.
Recession is a reality of economic life, but interest rate hikes often contribute to it.
In the current situation, the Fed faces some conditions that have not existed before and which could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, gross domestic product will close to its historic minimum point for an increase in the Fed's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice nominal GDP was less than 4.5 per cent.
Even if the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching just 1.5 per cent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing all the year for a Fed growth decision, with all eyes glued to this week's meeting of the Federal Trade Market Commission, which closes on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an interest rate increase during this meeting, futures trading indicates a probability of just 25 per cent.
"In our survey conducted after 1950, all the rates of interest rate growth to date were in a super cycle of profit growth, with GDP propagating the peaks ahead of the recession very quickly after the recovery began," the report said.
On the contrary, this has been a strangely slow recovery after the worst recession in the period under consideration.
The current cycle is by far the longest-awaited Fed since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months and it has reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income has also been volatile since the market predicts an interest rate rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the bond case than in the case of actions when the Fed amends policy.
In the bond case, it seems that the benefits are changing the direction as soon as the first growth / drop in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate hike cycle, bond profitability is falling immediately, "Deutsche said.
Strategies Charles Schwab believe that these interest rate increases will determine the return of profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, driving the curve.
High-quality decorations are doing better in such an environment, although "we are still wary of forcing profitability," said in an analysis Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes markets have already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the estimated disinflation, there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, Curba profitability is more right, the average mortgage interest rate rise has expanded and volatility has increased - all the market's characteristics when Fed tightens policy.
Broadly, companies operating in the US will benefit from an interest rate increase and local products will become more attractive.
Large debts with high debts will suffer because the rise of the dollar will lead to the increase in their products into the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that" quality "stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate hike," analyst Goldman Sachs said in a report to customers.
Firms with strong balance sheets surpassed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital revenues and low-volatility stocks also surpassed similar-quality companies with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a large percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from rising the dollar.
Those who save may also have to gain, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after CFM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Tory MP Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station because 'silly'
It says it is increasingly similar to the commercial challenger
He also took to the BBC Music Awards, saying they were chasing the Brits Awards
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying this show was not original
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" QFM, an important MP said, putting pressure on the post to prove that he does something that commercial posts do not do.
Tory MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public radio station "silly is" and increasingly resembles the commercial opponent.
"I have the impression that Radio 3" silly is "- although I don't like to use the word - but I have the impression that it turns into CFM," he said.
He also took to the BBC Music Awards, launched last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, launched last year, appear to be Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that just copy what is already on the market, "Mr Bingham said.
The BBC's director general has denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 is much in front of its commercial rival on live music and educating the public.
I'm not going to be anywhere about classical music dating from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production does not have a rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important for Radio 3's commitment to discover new music and the allocation of new pieces," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to do more to draw the audience from the previous period because Britons have fewer knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC logo criticised at the meeting of the culture, media and sports committee because it would go on the trail of its trading rivals.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for about £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about the issue because it is not original and does not distinguish itself through anything?
Lord Hall insisted the show by BC1 - starring Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - would be made "in a specific BBC manner."
He added that he wants the corporation "to find the chicken egg in its own house" next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he declined to ban on the future of taking new seasons from The Voice or spending the money that goes on licences on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the lowest increase in August and the culprit could be Black.
In the first three months of 2015, online sales rose 7 per cent.
In the past month, it has been the slowest growth since 2000.
Online sales took off three years ago thanks to the use of mobile phone to make shopping.
Experts believe that the Black Sea Eagles in November could determine the reluctance to spend.
For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned Britain's shopping streets into ghost cities.
But specialists say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating an increase of just 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August presented the lowest growth in 2000 to date, with an increase of just 5 per cent over the past year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating an increase of just 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015.
"If we look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, for the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago when shoppers started using the mobile phone to shop.
So it increased the number of people who were able to shop online and could do it in diverse circumstances, such as from canapea.
But now that a little standstill, you could see a drop (growth).
The phenomenon of the Black Sea, imported from America, is listed as one of the reasons for falling sales.
In the specialists' view, buyers would refrain from making purchases ahead of the event that takes place in the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers flocked to computers to put hands on offer, which led to the crash of several retailers.
Specialists believe that Black Friday, when shoppers beat bargains, could prompt buyers' reluctance.
A study published by British Retail Consortium has determined that at least 1 inch of every $5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently carried out via online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After punishing the Bin Laden family, Muslims are the victims of the victims killed in the wake of the collapse of Sinjar in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walking on the streets of Muslims, with the first funeral taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the construction giant, Binladin Group for the breakdown.
The Health Minister said a total of 394 people were injured following the collapse of the cranes
In the street walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a collapsed shell at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who were crying dead joined the road to express their condolences, until the first dead reached the end of the final journey at Al-Moorem cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy site, where only a few days ago collapsed a building machete through the tavern, falling to the faithful.
The bodies were released for the funeral after the Saudi king sanctioned the Bin Laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also resulted in 394 wounded.
In the ceremony in the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a collapsed shell at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
The victims included the father of four children, Qasim Akram, of Bolton, Great Manchester, in his first pilgrimage when the cranes collapsed.
Mr Akram is in the UK with his parents prior to the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already pledged that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims coming to the city further.
Today, King Salman said the group of Binladin should not have left the arm of high cranes when the machete was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi press agency, said the group Binladin partially bears blame for the crash.
The news agency's English service did not show the specifics, but said the company's leaders were given a ban to leave the country.
Earlier this week, Salman had vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the cranes in the court of Britain's Moskeys, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came ahead of the hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
The group of Binladin has not yet made statements about the collapse of the cranes, and the group's representatives could not be contacted for statements.
The royal decree blamed the group because it has not used up-to-date safety measures and has not coordinated its work with the weather authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque in Mecca as part of the massive building effort led by the Bladin Group.
For decades, the Bladin family has a close relationship with Saudi Arabia's royal family and runs major construction projects.
The last Al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "disowned" son, disinherited by the family in the 1990s.
Prabuba has come under strong wind and rain conditions, just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is essential at least once in the lives of each Muslim physically fit.
Authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
Authorities have decided that relatives of the dead victims would receive a million Saudi Rials (£174,000) and the same amount to pay those with permanent injuries.
Other injured will get half of that amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of Swiss franc loan conversion
In the banking market, two offers of cash conversion in the Swiss franc have already emerged, with the main advantages being excluding currency risk and cutting rates.
The disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest can lead to higher rates.
The Transylvania Bank has just finished the process on the conversion of loans to francs granted by Volkbank, and the Post Bank announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
According to data compiled by analysts of the Financial portal Finzoom, the Post Bank offers three years of fixed interest to lions, 1.5 per cent, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, the Transylvania Bank's conversion offer was accepted by 83 per cent of credit customers in the franc thanks to two successive cuts: It has narrowed solitude with the value of risk and administration fees paid by the customer, then applied an extra 22.5 per cent to solitude in the lions.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to how they pay monthly equivalent in the lions before the conversion.
Thus, the Bank of Transylvania is reducing the rate by 42.5% and the Post Bank, with 33% in the first three years and, in theory, 18% over the coming years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the redemption of credit in CHF is that the currency risk is being removed, with the consumer being protected by the future increases in the franchise, and repayment will be made in the currency in which it collects its salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that no reassessment of the property is made, no additional guarantees and other income proof are required.
In practical terms, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of credit, nor will it be additional costs as in the case of a refunding.
Both banks also offer a cut to the monthly rate, compared to how customers pay before the conversion, equivalent to the lions.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first few years is made up of interest, and the customer is repaying very little from the main.
The low-interest Post's offer in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
It is unclear, however, how this interest will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25 per cent, so in total, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in variable-rate lions is that the ROBOR index will grow significantly over the next few years (more than the Libor index - CHF).
For example, ROBOR to three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013, at 6%, in 2009, at more than 15%, and in a few days of 2008, it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to defend other costs, too, in the initial offer.
The timing of interest rate decisions for the US Federal Reserve
The world is looking at its scheduled meeting in two days on Wednesday and Thursday when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether to increase or not interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll with the participation of 80 economists, a little over half that last week thought the decision would be made, I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we face a situation where a major central bank could drop zero rates and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low inflation level.
But the Fed must not ignore the less rosy global situation.
It has warned markets to prepare for an increase but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20: 00 CET.
Stars who have lost their chunks
The actor (left), along with his son Vicky (right), has undergone stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia and in 2009 he lost her partner with a life, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer.
The actor is also rumoured to have faced drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this certainly has a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw sits on the bar several months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double bogey in his right leg in the Manchester United Champions League match with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought him tears to the player's eyes and holding him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play the season again.
The injury occurred following a reckless intervention from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after Shaw, 20, broke the PSV defence.
He was given medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double-foot fractures and is in hospital."
It will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after then it will be operated in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he had 18, has difficulties, then plays fantastic and now that's something like that.
In the vagina he was put into the oxygen mask.
Plangea.
I am not a doctor, but a double replay is six months old and will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno was said to have had luck and escaped the red card and the concession of a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge alone when they say it's a foul and red card.
It was a very ugly meditation, with two legs.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for your messages, I have no words to express how weakened I feel, I start the road to recovery, I'll come back stronger."
Similar news: Manchester United hit by injury to Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
The England team's team has an extra reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, coach PSV, said: "It's a very ugly injury."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such a injury.
Our players never watch to hurt a challenger.
Moreno broke his leg playing for national Mexico against the team of the Netherlands led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"II is very hard because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear he's a very serious injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the stage.
I didn't get to see the ball, heading in another direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In the statement for SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to get through that.
I feel bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Battado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention from Chris Salling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked the omission of England but is still standing up
The victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but, having seen the team selected by England for the tournament, they are not considering a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the Test matches.
I would not eliminate the variant of a race victory either.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago, but he has good players on thorn in the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events in 2012 but will have a positive positive attitude.
Moeen Ali is evolving as spider and Adil Rashid, even if it's unknown at the level of testing, is an option for the attack.
Related subjects: Adam Lyth left England team for Test matches and was replaced by Alex Helected
Obviously as his main coach in Yorkshire, it's difficult to look at the decision not to select Adam Lyth in the squad.
He played the seven Test matches against two good strikers, in difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are judged after the results.
There were no questions about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that previously - the players are their own selection.
Any fifty years, and perhaps Lyth would have extended his temper, but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope that if it makes more iPhones for Yorkshire it will have some other opportunities.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when Spotify wasn't on the measure of his ability and it doesn't surprise me that; first of all, he's a team man.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noted in the Test matches.
Lyth had seven tweets - like Sam Robson ahead of him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had luck at home and travelling.
The only complaint you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in full form - but that missed opportunity is of the past.
In the team comes Alex Helected, a batsman I'm bowling very well.
He's a cricket player who has the "X Factor" and which I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a Trent Champion.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before him, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea of Moeen was launched to open up with Cook, which would lead extra spacecraft while keeping four bucks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a punter couldn't hit there and this left-hander has already shown he's given naibies.
Perhaps Moeen didn't bring success in his district, Worcestershire, but he was No 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old team teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches 38 as the Sharks before entering the open in 2001.
He wiped out three centuries away and didn't look behind.
Zafar Anjump comes to the team on the post-up spider post and although I've had limited contact with him, it struck me that he's a very impressive young man.
People might judge the early age - with an average of 31 to beating and 35 on the ball - and they might think it's a punt, but there's no bunch of nests and the selection opted for youth.
It's going to learn a lot from this tournament.
England have brought some changes to the coaching team as well.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the test matches could be a headmaster.
He's one of the best players and he will bring a lot of experience, given he played in any situation and against all sorts of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the White Bowl of the tournament and will bring both energy and ruthless ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuitive.
Sometimes, the new voices in the vestiar, even if they transmit messages that have been passed and previously, can bring fresh air into the team.
Colly Durham's teammates Ben Stokes rest for one-day matches, Root has got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
While I don't all agree, coaches and coaches do not do the program.
And you have to note, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never made easy.
Brexit camp could have the gain if the economy keeps in franchise by 2017
As it passes, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain into the EU is getting deeper into the mess, even without the selection of brilliant Jeremy "Yes or not?" Corbyn at the helm of the Labour Party or TTIP brings serious criticism to Europe on Tuesday.
Strangers also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Fargo.
A European diplomat explained last days that - submerged in similar crises with the one in the EU - not all of them being made domestic - some Member States are fed up with Britain's agenda of concessions and changes to the treaties, which the majority do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided they didn't want it if they erode social protection.
We could even call it the "selfies" agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, make a poise in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and say they have gained allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with the prospect of outside under the roof of the EU - "We don't let ourselves with France," Berlin says - suggests that more ministers and short-sighted officials from some capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the highly cautious German Chancellor, is an ally but has stood at the helm for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation clicked, how it happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who sat too much.
In 2017, France's President François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
And his strength is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain one on the left.
It's hard to believe they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from coming out of Britain - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some ministers may even be planning remarks that do not help, in the SNP's style, in the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my mum suggests.
"The renegotiation was fixed" and "Britain didn't get anything of value from renegotiation."
Europeans know on their skin how lively it can be, and how sceptical they are from the oligarch media who view the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn that ratified our 1973 entry into report 2: 1.
He can vaguely recall Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture to find non-payers, foreigners who defrauded the phone and pseudo-Domi who hold most of the key newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair is seeing him a little bit, but he realised that when Ed is locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give them bananas to distract them from the thought of eating at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a exit card.
The press has not forgiven him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who struck me girlfriend in the back on Monday at Westminster - told him not to consume his time with me - seems to be at risk to take the Murdoch strategy to boycott Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It can last, but it has to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but with certainty with Andrew Marr whose position on the BBC left her holiday on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call a breakthrough.
He says he would like to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with the Tories "anglicism could agree to that.
That's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Benn" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher in him struggled not to admit that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as the "shadow" minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 1970s when his father struggled on TV to be unfair to Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his office in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight to stay "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said, nor what JC told colleagues and MPs at the private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to convey - note, it also made me aware of me - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television, and especially in the pool of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a ticket to favour in Europe, allowing him to take good support for Labour in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell's basic driving and Corbyin on EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a heated discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the feminism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his leadership on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not campaign for the exit - foreign diplomats will be compelled to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin become political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the weak military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a Tory government cutting costs, as I was reminded of the launch of British Foreign Affairs Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticize Public Health Department's decision in England on electronic cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted in a meeting between 12 people, some of which are linked to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the British Medical Journal's editorial team (BMJ) have joined Lancet in criticising the evidence used by the Public Health Department of England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the "landmark" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."
Several researchers, however, questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the Lancet medical magazine attacked the "extraordinarily fragile base" he founded on the main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in BMJ have questioned the claims and set them "on solid soil or on the sand."
Martin McKee, a European public health professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said they expected the PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95 per cent less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In reality, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the drawing up of a multi-pronged decision-analysis model (MCDA) that would summarise their views on the negative effects associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research work.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which the executive director said would have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past year to conduct an independent study.
It also validated BAT's accreditation in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting said the funding received from a producer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding that there were reports that they would have received it from cigarette and tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The arguments have not been provided on the basis of which members of the table have been selected, but among them are a few 'rainbows' known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even say in the work of industry funding.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for the expertise in tobacco control.
The head of the tobacco control station in PHE also attended the meeting.
The research paper drafted by the group "convincingly whitewashed" the fact that there is a lack of "solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have according to most criteria," McKee and Capewell said.
However, there is no mention of any of these links or limitations in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said Ms E's claims that "to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the CFE health department, says he has responded in the past to claims in BMJ.
He said: "Electronic marijuana is significantly less harmful than smoking"
One in two people who smoked all life is losing their lives because of this vice.
All the evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic health cigarettes is minor compared, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about information arising and those that do not stem from evidence, especially given the high degree of public confusion about relative dangers relative to tobacco.
Annually, some 880,000 people lose their lives due to a disease associated with smoking, and the annual costs incurred by the NHS due to smoking reach £2 billion.
It is clear to the current evidence - namely that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risk, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national debt.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to the door!
The ads that shame Britain's arms trade
Watch the video by Amnesty International against the Weapons Fair.
Horrific deadly drones!

The joyful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advert for the biggest world arms fair is a fierce blade, carried out by Amnesty International to highlight the British authorities' desire to sell the weaponry of repressive regimes through Defence and Security of the International at the Phoenix Centre in the London 's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and in casinos that need a second look.
"Important announcement, you travel with DHS between 15 and 18 September?" Says one of the ads, using the fonts and branding of the London subway, with the DLC line turning into a tank's image.
In September of this year, a lot of weaponry dealers will bounce back on DHS customers are required to help stop the Weapons Fair.
The 300 posters are carried out by artists who exhibited works at the Mel Depot Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group has contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Pain," a 6-pound package Allen said it "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in bus stations on the planet."
London's transport department is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of leaflets.
One of the delusional announcements of the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Rachel Deeigh and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are asking more and more questions and looking to make the political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are moving towards collaboration with activists in protest movements, realising they need to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against gun trade that welcomes commuters circulating on Metro.
The footage by Amnesty had more than 100,000 Facebook views in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked free.
VCCP's director of creation, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around advertising for the arms fair - with a empty space in the Manhattan calendar - and thought "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with making a more realistic advert, but "enriching it with loud animations and colours, it was more striking."
"They have done a great job to help us increase the interest in selling illegal torture equipment within the Fair," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would require the UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the radar of the Weapons Fair comes from inside the CBD, where elephants offer fantastic products of euphemism.
In a press release, Saab leaked an order received from the US military on "AT4CS RS with a shoulder-to-shoulder support."

Eight gold rules to live in Camin
It's been 11 years since I moved to Camin, when I was a 19-year-old, who still believed in Berete and moral dexterity, but only now I remember the forced smiles of those that I annoy - and the many complaints about others.
Most of the things I learned can be summarised in the form of eight simple rules.

Violinist David Grimal: In Bach's era there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Barbour, Enescu were people who were working, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as solitary but also as initiator of a less ordinary project, downright "weird," as he even says, Les Dissonoo - an orchestra consisting of international soloists and talented musicians, who performs a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonoo was this year at the Billboard Festival with two performances: A performance, on Sunday, in which solist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one on Monday, when the front-runner Xavier Phillips was located in the foreground, with the co-operative artwork being unfazed.
Both performances, conducted on the Athenian stage, have shown the public a different kind of classical music.
Les Dissonoo appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at the time, the only classic musical ensemble where there is no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, the musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - they speak of instrumentalists, rather than composers.
They are trained as "specialist workers."
They themselves have the impression they need a conductor.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all the feisty musical is focused on conductor.
And so the genre, the music industry, is doing its marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So if you look at this world, we have some skilled workers, which is stupid, and a public that can't listen, but they have to look, which is stupid, "says David Grimal.
The violinist says that this change in the way he makes music came in the wake of his "musical deception" from her solitary career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and bring money and the music industry.
10 years ago, when I was around 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because we did not find the creativity and the Human fraternity in this system.
So I've never found any sense of continuing on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonoo.
That's in 2004, and at the time no one was doing so without a conductor: "The music world, highly conservative, didn't want such projects."
"How do you imagine doing marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no ego?" The artist asks.
David Grimshaw acknowledges that Les Dissonar is "a luxury," adding that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a stumbling block in the song act: "Curiously, the more complex repertoire we play, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are required to be present in the opera and not only in the role," Grimal says, adding that on Sunday's show "I was 74 conductors on stage."
In Grimal's view, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave" one, precisely because it also invited Les Dissonoo: "An extraordinary festival, where the greatest orchestras in the world are present that sing and 3 times a day, and in the middle of these guest orchestras and this strange group."
In a temple of the orchestra tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest for something different, which breaks down barriers.
Speaking about the opera of Enescu, the violinist admits he feels Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he didn't need a special approach when he introduced works of his hand in his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Mason's music is very instinctive, but that's when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who has made French music."
Grimshaw campaigns to change the way classical musical education is made, believing that "the musician's profession, as it is organised today, has a quiz of death" and that "the future of music is music itself."
We do not need to tour the world 5 times a year if it does not serve to do anything.
In Bach's era there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Barbour, Enescu were people who were working, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organising concerts, festivals, tours, the launch of albumes, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they do in the music service.
If we do not, we are in a system where creativity is suffering, no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave example to Romanian products before and post membership in the European Union: "In Romania, before you enter the EU, you have good vegetables and meat."
To enter the EU we had to adopt sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture reach the supermarket service, as is also the case in France.
With music happening the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonoo makes tomatoes perhaps not too nice, but when you cut them are true tomatoes.
In an ideal world, it should be for this music to return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done from educational policy.
"If we thought - as the Koreans do, the Chinese, the Japanese - that Western music is one of humanity's most beautiful things, we would reintroduce learning to school, re-introduce concerts on TV and through this education there would be no need to sell musical products," Grimal believes.
They are certainly things in classical music education that remain very Communist, that's everywhere, it's something very militarised.
It depends on this discipline if you compare a musician with a soldier, or if we form a musician who will perform at a tool, and, first of all, musician.
We are talking about a completely different education if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) has to be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's all something else.
After your hair, what's more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? "Asks the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another kind of making music comes just from overcoming this status of "soldier," overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at a certain point that they are not soldiers, and that's why after the concert I come out smiling."
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist as part of the "Festival of ideas," a discussion with the public at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.

Cinema City is looking for "small philanthropists"
Cinema City launches best baby challenge: Doubling of two characters in 'Crawberry' superannuation
Do you have a super talented and spontaneous kid who likes the films?
Give him the chance to get the star.
In September, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to get future stars and who have between 8 and 16, Cinema City is looking for the "small Voices of Great," giving them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classic disposals, the focus is on bringing the actor's voice to the cartoon character, in the last period, to the creation of the story and those who are expected to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City, however, wants to discover new voices, and that is why we are launching an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and cause parents to score their children at our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are sympathies and hugs are fun.
"Children will have fun and will have a real chance of being part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the contest, from 11 September to 30 September, Cinema City is organising a shortlist that will be chosen by 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the chance to perform in a recording studio alongside professionals.
All the parents need to do is access the micillaimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where to score the child in the contest and prepare it for the voice test.
Later, they have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is expected to read and then the child will register performing its own double version.
Four films about friendship, gym heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the show: "# Galbene 3D," "Mune: The guardian of the 3D Moon," "Blinky Bill: Koala at the 3D" and "Albinuta Maya 3D."
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream turned and will double a character in the superproduction "The Other Queen - Crawberry Out of 3D," which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx Cups are mixed, drops fiscal forecasts for 2016
FedEx has declared disappointing results for the quarter, with gas giant cutting profit estimates for all year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
During the same period last year, FedEx announced it would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares fell about 2.5 per cent in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of Wednesday's opening bell bell.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 dollars for the fiscal year ending in May next year, up 20 cents lower, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts expected to have $10.84 dollars, according to a survey by Fairfax Media.
The falling estimate comes despite rising prices by 4.9 per cent on average, with entry into force on 4 January and higher overcharging for land transport of large or high-weight packages, which will apply since November.
The company said it is still expected to increase earnings from the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
President and Director-General Fred Smith said "the company is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of global production and trade."
The hiring plans during the holiday period were announced a day after the UPS contestant said he planned to hire 990,000-95,000 extra workers, about the same number of workers he made last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than the previous year.
The shares per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zack Investment Research.
Profit rose 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zafestible poll of $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years of a decline in international priority shipments, leading to the stagnation of revenue recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has salted the results of the FedEx Cup division.
In the last quarter, the revenues of the global division rose by 29%, but operating revenues have basically stalled due to higher costs for large packages and their own insurance.
The U.S. unit recorded an increase in revenue thanks to higher base charges, while earnings recorded by the Fremantle division fell due to rising costs.
On pre-market trading, about an hour before the start-up sound, FedEx shares were up 3.85 dollars or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the closure fell 11 per cent year-on-year and 17 per cent from the record maximum on June 11th.
On the occasion of the most expected meeting in recent years, policymakers in the Fed will spend two days this week around a table of mahon Honduras with 27 feet to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at an end of the central bank's sitting room, a mural of the United States will be seen.
The map is meant to recall that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed president, and her colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above anything.
The Central Bank has received a dual task from Congress: To maximise employment rates in the US and maintain price stability.
But since the big economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed there is a third unwritten task: Financial stability.
And this third task could be the X Factor in a decision too difficult to predict, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is ready to be dislocated by the unprecedented incentive offered by the near-zero interest rate in force since the end of 2008.
Even though most data points to a growing economy, recent turmoil on global financial markets may scare Fed officials already wary of adding volatility by raising the benchmark rate to federal funds - even with a percentage point of percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and the main issues they will follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage company Stigen Nicolaus & Co.
"I think, however, that if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, growing uncertainty on the world market is sufficient to give them arguments to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on the decision that the Fed will take, with this in itself causing instability in the financial market.
About half of economists polled recently by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate rise this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing the likelihood of growth is only 30 per cent.
That would indicate a fall on the stock market if the Fed raises interest rates unless those who draw up policies would soften the blow by promising that it would take a long time to the next increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to 16.599.85.
The Aviva was triggered by expectations that Fed decision makers will keep the rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Group.
"It would be surprising for the Fed to raise the interest rate at the moment," Lonski said.
If Fed decision makers would do so, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets."
Other experts said an interest rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty over when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on track to raise rates by 0.25 per cent this month, the first small step towards the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he was expecting an interest rate rise this year despite the objections raised by liberals how more economic progress would be needed.
While job creation slowed in August, the growth of the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Pay rises have shown signs of growth.
And while inflation has continued not to meet the central bank's annual target, Fed decision makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of falling oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the strain on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macrooo.
But global financial markets began to enter the fiancée later this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16 per cent below the record maximum reached in May as investors feared slowing the Chinese economy would drag global growth down.
The market slipped somewhat this month, with the Dow index now about 10 per cent below the maximum in May.
For Fed decision makers, the market buzz is adding to the complex calculation of the interest rate hike.
"Without what has happened on the financial markets and the news about weakening the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be more decisive in the sitting," said Stephen D. Onier, an experienced researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now he is expected to wait at least a month to manage the effects better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and they almost have no data on which to later rely on events in China," Odom said.
The eclipse of the global economy is not one of the Fed's major interests, so virtually it should not be considered in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
A mere hint of then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" the monetary expansion triggered the earthquake on global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly negative, it is expected that Fed officials are not only able to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Cowell, head of the global strategy department at the welfare management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, Federal Reserve Bank president in Richmond, Viti., said this month that "Fed has a huge reaction track to changes in the financial market that appear not to be related to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a vote member of the Federal Committee on Open Market, the decision-making body, which advocated interest rate hikes, provided the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis that has affected Asia has led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 per cent in three meetings, "despite implications with limited identification possibility for US development," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials returned to the charges.
The EDF should put the issue of financial stability in the first place only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting committee.
The last turbulent period is nowhere near the level, he said.
"Certainly we don't want to get into the situation of afraid of an interest rate increase because they have upset the markets," Posen, chairman of the Institute for International Economics, said.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something is changed in this regard, I do not think it should take premature action.

Seven 's Suns dominate the polls, despite the attempts by Channel Nine to broadcast in the Today Show about changing the party's leadership
The urgent move by Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of changes at the Liberal party leadership has not brought a significant increase in the audience for Today.
Channel Nine's aunt delivered from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull.
The Suns competition, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of coverage over the course of several weeks, which included Dubai, New York, Casfall Niagara and Cancun.
This "cruelty" of the distance didn't seem to count too much for Aussie TV viewers, the Suns having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today recorded a slight increase compared to Monday's (3176,000) hearing and last Tuesday (283,000), but the figures were lower than last Thursday (33,000).
Today has lowered the gap to the Suns in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and the Sunshine Coast 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
Deila, in September, Suns has an average audience of 39,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
That's the most exciting thing that happened throughout the morning.
This morning, it is not only Parliament that is affected by the power of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the question!

The main story was the stunning debut of the 800 Weaver series starring former Packers star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, given the subject of a late widow, who decides to move together with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson is able to cope alone with a show, without the star of Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
The audience results last night responded positively as "yes."
The X Factor show posted by Seven has kept on the stand, with 1,136 million viewers, taking slightly over the show The Block (838,000) and the TAFL (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs in the second evening in which he delivered The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17: 00 to 17: 30) of the new general culture show moderated by Andrew O'Keefe had an average of 46,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17: 30 to 18: 00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of the show The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge, 720,000 figure.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The drop in the audience recorded by Chase Australia in the second evening will provide tacit confidence to those at Nine that Hot Seat will eventually triumph at 17: 30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar minutes, the show that failed to beat Trump's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested as a weapon at an airport in Sibera.
Because he had openly provoked President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets in Nepal protesters
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The Violent occurred on Tuesday evening in the Shahandehi district, about 280km west of the U.S. capital.
According to Danielle Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station and some of them threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas after firing in the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, according to him.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which they know can kill but usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest event after weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern region, where members of the ethnic Madhesi group say the new provinces set up under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in the violent clashes triggered on 10 August.
When four key political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces - a major step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, the country ruled centrally for hundreds of years.
The procedure for drafting a new constitution was launched in 2008, but legislators stepped up the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, at the Sharks, legislators voted the clauses in the draft constitution, and officials said the new charter could be passed on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, policemen and guns
The prime minister is continuing the exchange of words with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of Wednesday's government meeting, Ponta reiterated Romania's strong stance on the refugee crisis.
We are making every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all the institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania disagrees and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or gun police.
"It is a disgrace for Europe and 21 to apply methods of the 1930s," Victor Ponta said.
"The prime minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and set out in Thursday's meeting." The prime minister concluded.
NHC announces 60 per cent probability of cyclone south of Green Bay Islands
A wide-ranging high-pressure front about 560 miles south of the southernmost point of the Green Islands is showing a 60 per cent probability of turning into tropical cyclones over the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined frontline of low pressure about halfway between the Green Islands and the Antilles Islands also features a 60 per cent likelihood of a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami-based meteorologist added.
Weight reduction surgery could be useful in diabetes case with light obesity
The benefits of weight reduction surgery in the case of easy obesity, with diabetes and type 2 diabetes may maintain for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetes with easy obesity is living longer after surgical intervention of weight loss than those following non-inflammatory treatments.
"A lot of time is needed to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, the CDC wrote an article about the new study in Julia.
Surgery for weight loss, as well as bariatric surgery, uses different methods to lower the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have carried out on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (IMC) 35 or higher.
The IMC, a measure-measurement unit in the report, is considered normal in the 18.5-24.9 range.
The IMC value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with the IMC over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your email accessory: 1,usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used the collected data after 2007 in a dolphin that compares two types of barrier surgery - a gastric and gastert in Manson - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes to people with easy obesity.
The average IMC to people who suffered surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, the IMC to people who have received non-surgical treatments against cosmetic diabetes has remained close to the same level, which is 29.
Of those who suffered surgical intervention, diabetic diabetes has completely healed at 36 per cent and in part to 28 per cent.
In the group treated through medical methods, by comparison, cosmetic diabetes has completely healed at only 1% and partly to just 2% of the subjects.
In addition, control of arterial tension, chimpanzees and LDL cholesterol "bad" cholesterol were generally better in the surgical group, "the authors concluded.
The showers also monitored the high level of hemoglobacter A1c, which reflects the level of glicking in time.
Forecasters write that the optimal level of boutique A1c is below 7 per cent.
After surgical intervention, the average level of hemoglobacter A1c fell from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
But in the group treated through medical methods, it stood at about 8 per cent.
But this "glicemic control" improved - reflected by the improved levels of boutique A1c - did not reduce the death rate to five years, according to chief researcher Dr Chih-Cheng, and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with Gastrections in Manson, the experienced surgical intervention group lost more in weight (18.7 compared to 14.2 kg), recorded more significant falls in the IMC value (7.4 per cent to 5.1) and hemoglobacter A1c (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent) and presented a higher probability of a complete remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent versus 16.7 per cent).
While the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on high-weight people in Sweden that surgical intervention extends life, says Blackstone, of Arizona University, the Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, the obese people who suffered stroke surgery showed a likelihood of about 29 per cent less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
While the new study did not indicate a survival benefit to patients who suffered surgical intervention, Blackstone said it was an upbeat aspect for people with the IMC under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is the point where this work is critical, because it says that this surgical intervention is safe in the low-billing group," without increasing the risk of death or renaline disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start -taking weight seriously when the patient's prescription reaches 27-30.
"I think we're waiting too long to urge people to take that seriously," she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have shortened their circuits to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely hard to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetan Lib Dems has sent an appeal to end the violence in refugee mother countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama's Committee on compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the face of each nation's interests and even every continent.
It also stressed that, although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is great care for several thousand refugees, but we also need to think about long-term solutions to bring peace and genuine development, especially through education, in Muslim countries," he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems, "he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 11 September terror attacks, saying the violent response from the US has generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know that his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences, "the Dalai Lama said.
The four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested the antidepressants of hands over the past 4 years
Under the anti-poisoning Centre in Georgia, US anti-poisoning centres have reported an increase of about 400 per cent since 2010 in terms of the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed the antidepressant with high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the anti-poisoning Centre in Georgia, cases of the ingitis of the state of hands on children under the age of 12 reported at anti-poisoning centres climbed from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them arrive at the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children were intentionally drinking and others are doing it to impress their friends or respond to challenges on social media.
YouTube can be watched videos showing teenagers how they drink brightness to create cheap drinks.
The teens are said to have blended the detergent with drinking water to get a bigger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the mosquito.
"A child doesn't think he's doing harm," Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (of handsets of hands) are the perfume.
Underwear with flavours of strawberries, grapes, Orange is the most attractive to children.
The handbag contains about 45-95 per cent alcohol.
Especially at small children, only a few swallowed up can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very focused alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poisoning centre at the University Hospital in Kansas, told Fox Channel 4 in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of hot water on the table, but people leave these jaws of hands in affordable places and if the small ones reach them, this is a quick way to consume much alcohol.
The six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who was recently ingested at the school equivalent of four sprays with a toothbrush with aroma of strawberries, reached the emergency room to receive treatment.
Having an alcoholic 14179, twice the threshold to which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor at the emergency room who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah Ballmajea and she could not go when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored it overnight in a separate children hospital to identify signs of brain damage because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was terrifying," Ortoria Scott, the mother of Nhaijah, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised Parinkers and teachers to use wet products or servings without alcohol and stop letting their hands-in-hand logos at the hands of the children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women passed away after they swallowed a handbag containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assumed the product contained methamphetamine, a lethal substance, rather than alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students in northern New York were plotting to poison their "bad" teacher "putting antibacterial products into the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher is very runner-up in his hands-on and banned him in his room for classes.
Police considered the plan "trivial" and filed the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.
Rumour Mill: No misunderstandings at Celtic
Griffiths is demonising rumours about the odds on Celtic, Deila admitting that Hoops is not at the best but they will recover.
Hearts clash with SFA on Neilson's allegations and Warburton wary of January purchases that hurt team unity
The Dons raise the difference from Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half brought them from Aberdeen a close win over Hamilton at Pittodrie, with the Dons scoring a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths demonises rumours of misunderstandings
There have been rumours of discord in Celtic, dismantled by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team were not subjected to increased pressure as they prepare to confront the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
The absence of Scots in the race for the title trick is Dutch - de Boer
The former midfielder of the Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - for not playing for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently the ambassador of those at Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands we are no longer sending the summary of those from Celtic; why?"
Because they're not the Rangers there.
Here, it's not just about the return of the Rangers.
He's talking about Fifty Shorm.
There is talk of both teams together and there is an interest in the interest.
The tension is high in matches in the Fifm League and not just Scots want to see those games.
I'll change the situation, promises Deila.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic are struggling but the Norwegian boss has vowed to change the situation.
Defeat with Malmo and subsequent elimination in the Champions League were followed by defeat in front of Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now in the standings with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had periods before and they'll come back."
We want to emerge as quickly as possible from this situation.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are extremely angry or trolling about what's going on.
We also feel like us - but we need to go further.
We necessarily need the support of those from Celtic because so the players are getting better.
It is extremely important that we remain united now.
Warburton's caution on January transfers
Despite the comments just weeks ago suggesting he would have identified several goals for January transfers, the NSW Rangers boss, Mark Warburton is wary when it comes to transfers, insisting he doesn't want to affect the Ibrox team's unit.
The former head of Brentford said: "The period of January transfers is very different from that of summer."
In the case of players transferred the summer, there are the pre-season in which they can be integrated, which you could see this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring players who aren't needed.
Celtic target Michu after retirement
Swansea's Striker, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested he could retire at the end of the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player struggled two years with problems at ankle and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts clash with SFA on Neilson's comments
Hearts were running 2-1 when Paterson was removed and lost 3-2, but the FCC's red card was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "We haven't questioned integrity, we haven't commented on Spotify."
Griffiths jacks to avoid Tyneastle
The hipster Hipbee was taken to the point after admitting he sang a song with defamatory lyrics about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skthat.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in Edinburgh's Rinchurn region ahead of a Derby with Edinburgh at Tyneastle.
"It was Derby and it was the excitement of the moment," Trump said, adding: "I don't need to say I'm not going back to Tyneastle than if I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council trusts Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that those on the Dundee United board still have confidence that the management team will change the situation - but he agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
II will once again bring boys in shape, "Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "dirty win" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that the Aberdeen team must cling to Hamilton Acters desperately to get the seventh successive victory in the league, which brought them five points to Celtic thanks to the first half-half penalty carried out by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: "There is no team that would have won something, in the cup or league, and that won't have won games like that."
Unemployment rate in Scotland unchanged as UK rises
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 in May-July, while the number of unemployed in Britain per total has risen by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent in Scotland was higher than that in the UK, 5.5 per cent, according to figures from the National Statistics Office (Office for National Treasurer (ONS)).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 in the three-month period, with the number of workers currently employed by 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in the quarter to 74.0 per cent - a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long-term authorities' plan has put the foundations for a stronger economy."
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the Scottish labour market, with the employment rate rising and the rate of falling unemployment.
Why I am witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
Later today, except for a belated legal intervention, I will look like a man to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a room for observers in the execution room of the Oklahoma State prison, and I'll see how Richard Giffe is executed by administering lethal injections.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation came first in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day is approaching, I am appalled by the idea.
The ASA, why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell all the story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
True, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because usually the demands exceed the number of seats available, a macabre lottery is taking place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
The elected ones will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would stand next to Richard Giffe's closest friends, in addition I have developed my own connection with him over months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two-and-a-half hours.
I like the type.
Radem often a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say they can't be a witness and a journalist, so I'm not going to allow me to have a carnett and a pix to score what they see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma has accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
We have the lesson.
He tells the story of the detainee as he wants it, getting access.
I cried at her.
He admitted he "could have done better," but he still believes they are wrong.
Richard Giffe disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote to them.
I don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't even do it if he asked me.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants to be present an international report to write about the subject.
It believes that if he dies, the advert will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Belller, reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the multimedia file series I've made.
I will not come back here on all of the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Giffe is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese are guilty of complicity.
But I think he's very likely not to be guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll look at him dying from that perspective.
I can't pretend I'm totally objective.
For that, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out how it's to watch a man I like dying needlessly.
Peter Moody claims Queensland tried to spy on and threaten to pull out of races
Peter Moody said Queensland Racing Victoria had tried to infiltrate a spy at its gallons last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the races.
It launched an attack against Queensland and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming they were conducting a personal campaign against him, the straw that filled the glass as the removal of Lady Tatai in the race because of a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media he has always tried to do what is best for the field of races and that he's put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome to the test for Lidari's bowler, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months she swallowed his words about statements about spies and didn't want to resemble "foxes that don't get to grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I've been silent for a long time but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything bursts out suddenly," Moody said.
He is known to have continued.
Sometimes you react and we must bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Disney will go home and I'll sleep quietly.
I want to go head-to-head and I want the owners with whom I am working to see that I strive to give them everything that is better.
From the time they start to think it doesn't happen, I have to give up the workout profession.
At that point I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody threw the bomb in an interview for racing.com in which he said the integrity department had tried to spy on graphies.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dillon Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room alongside a man - whose name I will tell him if I am asked - and offered to hire him to my graphies to provide information about the work there," Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously I consider myself a cheat.
If so, then they should give all their resignation because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former RVL chairman David Moodie, current chairman of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and I know today.
Should I think it's something personal?
Is it necessary for the RVL to start having the backbone and can fire outsiders for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe that's how the others see.
Maybe I have to take my licence and give me a part, and I don't have doubts that the statements they are doing now might prompt them to think about it.
However, I have reached the point where I do not care and that is what I am saddened.
I am very saddened.
I'm going to put pressure on and get him to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The youngster's frustration grew with the long-running probe into testing at the other in which Lidari was involved and the removal prompted him to say he could "get his licence on the table."
Moody, whose name is most commonly associated with beating the undefeated Black Caviar, labelled the treatment rule on the day of the race as "ridiculous" after applying on the feet of horses a pupil with namesy or argas, which violates the rules.
That concludes the rules of the races.
I have to take my full responsibility for that, "he says.
One of my employees put them out of the red sludge on the leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment of the day of the race consisting of the application of the puppies, for which Queensland has opened an inquiry.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that there is a need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by the escape from the crash site.
The cyclist was flown by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, seriously injured after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police representatives say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
Monday, a 50-year-old man, surrendered to police in Shepparton.
It appears to be charged with fleeing from the crash site, failing to provide first aid and other road offences.
Biancho, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized, in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is responding to their opponents in doping charges.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of the placenta used by his team as "distorted topics" brought into question by the NRL's top two favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed players from the Storm to "take them to the throne" team in the game's nervous game in Sydney's qualifying final on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to the Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match with North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening when he called the game a "show" of rugby league and said the two teams in Queensland were not too much in the arm.
Bellamy jumped in the defence of the touchy touchdown approached by his team and said the players were simply on "touch" when the plates were.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two senior coaches slammed her team, meaning they were Incare that the Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop there - I didn't hear Trent Robinson to complain about the ball when they beat us with the score 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so only in the last six weeks we have really focused on contact in the plates, and so we have changed the situation.
Trent is in this position for three years and obviously has a lovely team so he's probably not used to losing and it was a fox for him.
Nosus how it's always going on during this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "Anima Football," recalling his mentors St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the championship in 2010 playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about thrilling football.
He argued his mind comparing his game on Saturday evening with our game on Friday evening and talked about how thrilling the game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he was not interested in either as black under the angle.
But now he has a team that can play what we see as thrilling football, especially thanks to fast-paced young midfielders.
The sort of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought that argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his playing style - not any team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because I am somewhat impervious to the match with us.
Six weeks ago they were probably not thinking about us when they were thinking about key matches.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between the Storm and the Roosters has been a more fierce competition over the score compared to the match between the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, we didn't see him yet, how long was the score? 16-12?
Our game finished 20-18, in our game there were two tries, that's the thrilling game?
Or thrilling, do you mean making breaks and not kidding?
For me they are plans.
If I talk about us, it means that at one point we could meet them.
The Storm is free this weekend because they have won the right to play home either with North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in Saturday's final qualifying final at AAMI Park, with tickets putting on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the smartphone to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was then sleeping in an online messaging service where another user sent him a series of indecent images having children as a subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the phone's disappearance, which he found in Hogg's hand while he was asleep.
She looked in the phone and found the disturbing messages after she immediately alerted her mother.
After the arrival, police saw the five pictures then looked at computers found at the scene and found "disturbing" searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of all children.
Hogg pretended to have done it to "attract paedophile" on the Internet before "claiming to be a policeman to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the court in Dundee: "He said he was an addiction - that he's addicted to scared people.
He admitted he had made searches on the computer but said he did because he wanted to turn himself as a policeman to scare the paedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and that he asked the person to stop sending them and other pictures.
He said she did it to lure.
He said he is no longer thinking clearly when she is drinking and wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr Robertson added: 'When the girl found the messages on the phone, she shouted her mother and screaming and crying.
Shirta saw indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
Shirta was photographed and told the defendant used the computer and the designer to speak to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, 23, enrolled in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges that he had carried out or made indecent pictures of all children, and violated the conditions of parole on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court at his appearance on March 24 this year.
Defence counsel Gregor SIM has called for Hogg not to be registered in the sex offenders' register because it can be said that the offence "did not involve a significant sexual aspect."
Judge Alistair Carmichael adjourned the sentence until October, for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in the file but remained in custody before the ordeal for other files.
He was passed on the sex offenders' register before he was given the sentence.
Robert Mugabe, president of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the floor of a podium.
But it has not been hurt, but the video of the fall has become viral on social networking sites.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who said they would have received anonymous threats of death, threatening him not to booze Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month booed him during his speech in Parliament - the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the European Democratic Party for Democratic Party (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number, but it is titled" Death, "he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
II warns MPs that immunity only applies to Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity has no value.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Morgan, is "concerned" about threats sent to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 30,000 layoffs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 redundancies as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year, HP will split on the stock market in two societies, separating the computer and printer division with corporate hardware and retail services.
The projected upgrades will bring about $2.7 billion in costs from the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructuring will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise to a more competitive and sustainable structure in terms of costs," said Meg Whitman, president and director general HP, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will have a broad business portfolio that will help transition firms to the new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing demands of our worldwide customers.
Under a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and "focus on providing integrated without rival solutions" to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by the graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, is said to be an object of the work of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto has been called "the cradle of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone massive reorganisation to adapt to switching from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The move taken HP, the world's second largest computer maker and one of the largest technology companies in the US, is the latest in the field, relying on the idea that businesses focusing their attention better in a direction have a better performance.
KingsFest: Comedy series that taught us important lessons about the friendship between men
The absence of similar personation in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the past 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death to men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more frequent in men than women.
In a bid to deal with the problem, the Campaign Against Mental Life (Lib Dems) named 2015 as the Year of Barrier, keen to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to achieve this challenge.
A recent study conducted on more than 2000 high school students showing depression symptoms concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends "with a healthy mood," her chances of recovery are doubling down.
To the same extent, for people who aren't depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends reduces half the likelihood of mental disorder appearance.
Of course, for the friendship to have effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social media, where the focus is on style and not on substance, the immediate nature of the response often has priority before contact with meaning.
Our digital trajectories have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong, open-minded figure to fun and success, even if in reality isolation is the one that dominates.
This shallow success is dominated by what psychologists call extrexi values; money, image, social status, all with the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which affects our mental health even more deeply.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that he turned attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but of their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The frequent booze of Joey and Chandler, the moments in which he looks at football in the first comet and Ross's passion for Rachel came out of the fact that it is known that men can associate themselves with this situation, even if they often complain to completely explore their feelings.
As a social worker explained to me: "... my role to listen to people with the tendency of suicide and depressed has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make the difference."
Often, people who turn to us do not feel able to speak with friends.
The old adage to do it is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to give more psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long term.
The show highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Oed by much helps objective intervention, outside, through the phone, people have in times of desperation, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you attend this weekend at a SFest organised by Central Avenue, with complete restoration of the shoot-to-shoot plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and welcome.
It is never known what difference your friendship could do.
Friends is broadcast by Central Aberdeen at the end - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of the SnowsFest
Di Maria Marks and helps PSG set aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he scored against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria marked his debut match in the Champions League on Tuesday and helped PSG impose himself in front of the Swedish team Malmo.
We continue to present the pain of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani made their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the match series in the Champions League series, with an emphatic 2-0 win against Malmo in the game on Tuesday on Parc des Prisoner.
Di Maria marked in less than four minutes after the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the champions France into the lead although they missed a number of occasions before securing their advantage with the Cavani goal in the 61st minute.
Reaching Group A alongside Real Madrid and Sahtior Donetk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the French team's goal is not only qualification in the bullpen but also an improvement of the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
But while they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the chance of goal after being replaced by the team in his hometown and the club he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or in the Champions League, so the 2-0 win creates trouble for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference to the next scorer, even though there are issues you have to refine along the season," Blanc says.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and I did it, although I am sorry we weren't able to give one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury to one of three changes to the Paris squad, with a 2-2 replay at home by Bordeaux in League 1 at the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who would lead PSG to the next level in Europe and showed that when he tasered to Marco Verratti's care behind the defence of Malmo before getting incredible over Johan Wiland in the long corner of the right goal.
But if anyone expected PSG to get the win over their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in play-off to get to this stage and entered the field with nine runs to national teams, with a defence of five people and two defensively defensive midfielders, was a strong contender.
But their attack was not impressive, with the exception doing by Nikola Djurdjic who crossed Kevin Trump's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed the pace a few times, giving a few unnecessary passes and uncompleting the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five tries only in the first half and was then replaced by the Cavani even after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skilful in supporting his colleagues, who he cares about as the one that Di Maria sent in a deviant nose by Wilmingfish in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after an hour in the match, thanks to Cavani, uruguayan who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic cared for Maxwell.
That goal removed the hope from Malmo that they would re-balance the score and only a superb shot of Wilmington from the distance to reject David Luiz kept the final score before the newly intruder Ezequiel Lavezzi overturned a goal in stoppage time.
The team's Norwegian coach in Malmo, Age Hareide, later said PSG were with a class above and that "the last game we played in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the league in Sweden, which is not up to the same level.
The caliphate is not enough.
Jos hats off for PSG.
They've done an excellent game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in shares sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the commodity market, has raised $2.5 billion in shares as part of a wide-ranging debt reduction plan.
Glencore, based on the London bourse, said it sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
After losing 57 per cent of its market value this year, the company is taking on the trending with falling prices on the commodity market, due to China's slump in economic activity influencing demand and causing disaster in the markets.
Preferential subscriber law increased the price of Glencore shares on the London bourse in Wednesday morning trading.
Shares climbed 2.77 per cent to 131.60 silk at the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore has unveiled the $2.5 billion stake in shares as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 inches per share, 2.4 per cent less than Tuesday's closing price.
It pulled 1.3 billion shares out of the company, accounting for 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concern over the rising Chinese economy in prolonged stagnation has led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40 per cent.
Xi calls for broader global economy expansion
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with reforming that the economy needs to open wider to the outside world to fuel growth.
"China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and to improve opening policies," Xi said, as part of the 16th meeting of the Central NSW Committee for Continuing General Reforms (Central Leishman Group for Deepening Overall.).
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and will take place for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of guides, including a negative list of market access regulation, relaxation of border control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private equity and reorganisation of the residents' registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify sectors and areas of activity where investment is not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in the allocation of resources, providing a business environment based on legislation and providing greater openness to the market.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.
Also, according to the statement, China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In a bid to open state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
"The state authorities will not change their policy on foreign investment and protect the legitimate interests of companies established out of foreign investment and provide them with better services," according to the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called 'green cards', optimising the requirements and simplifying the process of submitting applications.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the right of practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement after the meeting.
Education unions unhappy with government proposal to raise wages by 10 per cent
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of education unions have not reached any result, with the government proposing a 10% wage hike since 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and trade unions wanted a 15% increase in November, or one of 20%, since December.
The talks took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the prime minister accompanied by Education Minister Sorin Cincanu, Finance Minister Eugen Gravovici and Labour Minister Rovana Plumb.
Today's Government proposal did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have reached the situation by convening the leaderships of our federations.
The 10 percent that have been promised today are for us less than what we expect.
"In fact, these 10 percent are the money we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government last year for 2016," said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
Ponta: In future health and education will be the areas where we will invest all the money we have.
According to him, on Thursday, a meeting of the FSLI will be held to attend and representatives of the government to present the country's confederation representatives in the country proposal for wage growth, with trade unionists deciding whether to accept the executive's offer.
The prime minister also told the trade unionists that the government is trying to send the Law on Employment as quickly as possible to Parliament so that it can enter into force on 1 December.
In the piece of legislation, salaries in the education system are expected by 25 per cent of the total 70 per cent increase, an increase in the document to be made in the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised them trade unionists in the entirety of the 2016 court rulings.
Migrant crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkey's territorial waters on Tuesday after the boat in which they were in the wreck.
The victims include 11 women and 5 children, AFP reports, according to Yahoo News.
The boat is located in the Aegean Sea and is heading to the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coast guard said it was able to save 249 people who were in the boat wreck, but they are still unaware of their nationality.
Earlier on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also, at the weekend, 34 migrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 kilometres from Turkish shores.
The situation was a similar one: The boat was carrying more people than its capacity, so it was sinking.
The route has become a popular one lately for migrants who want to escape war and hard life in countries like Syria or Iraq.
More than 100mph, made redundant because they were too thick
Air India Air India is laying down about 130 calories per day and spacecraft because they are overweight, the company announced late last week.
The state-owned company announced the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is "ridiculous" and "shocking to do exist," The Washington Post writes.
Mass firing is the latest in a ten-year battle between the company and the spacecraft of drips.
The weight limit for them dates back to the 1980s when Air India began using graphic with its weight and standard.
In 2006, Air India fired nine calories as "exceptionally overweight," as this "can have an effect on the reflex and can prevent the agility needed to carry out emergency measures."
Steenkamp gave the company sued, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to make them weaken have failed," a spokesman for the company then explains.

If the Masters champion decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, defender Paul Papp has decked a football school.
The "Paul Papp" Academy will operate in the city of Nevada, with residents in the city expected at a first selection action.
I am extremely happy that we have reached this stage, to give the start to the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without worrying about training.
They need to have one care: That's to play football as well as possible.
Technical details must not be their care.
They need to put their talent into value.
This wants to make the Football Academy 'Paul Papp'.
"I also expect Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of children to show them that he is with them," the Papp footballer told dejeundo .ro.
Children at the Stapel Academy are expected to have children in the age of up to 11 years.
All the party wants to govern.
Acting PSD President Liviu Dragnea said Tuesday that all the party wants to remain in government and, if the prime minister wants, at the PSD Congress, that decision will be formalised.
I understand that Mr Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants in government, all the party.
If we want to formalise through a congressional ruling, we will do that too.
There will be no emotion about that.
"There were no elements, voices in the party, split in the party that would give someone uncertainty of government or give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the PSD's National Permanent Office meeting.
The PSD announced when it will make the congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the leadership of leadership, a clear message would be made if the government decides to proceed with the opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce on Monday whether I will run for a post at Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday whether he will run for a leadership position at the upcoming Congress.
I will weigh on Monday after the Executive Committee, if it is also set out in the congress.
"I will announce whether I will run for a post in the party leadership," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's meeting of the PSD's National Permanent Office.
Intrigued if the hesitation in announcing the candidacy is related to his dossier, Dragnea said he did not have the problem.
I do not have the problem that you refer to, but I find it right and honest to all my colleagues in the party to announce or not a candidacy when it formally sets out the date of Congress.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of social-democratic subsidiaries proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on 11 October, and the exact date of Congress will be decided by the party's Executive Committee on Monday.

What about coach Darren Cahill
Simona Halep is in front of a crucial decision for her career, having to choose whether to continue or not work with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year as part of the Adidas and Development programme, with the Australian technician with the Romanian only in major tournaments.
Simona only had words of praise for Cahill, who seems the only coach to have been able to impose himself in the face of the culinary fantasy.
But Brisbane's schedule will end by the end of this year, and Halep must decide whether to give him a consistent contract to Cahill or whether he will give up collaboration.
We do not yet know exactly what will happen.
We are talking and seeing.
"After Singapore, I can give an answer," Simona testified at a news conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in current tennis, calling for a contract of about a million dollars a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a profession he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last race at which Simona and Cahill will work together is the Campions Masters in Singapore.
It was not normal, I was not respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke down with Romania's national team last autumn.
The former manager testified that he did not understand with FRF chairman Razvan Burleanu after he took his place to Mircea Rahman, and thus made the decision to leave the national.
Finally, he proposed to the head of the federation to substantially increase his salary to stay, but he was refused.
At the moment I am not sorry that I have gone from national.
Then I looked sorry, we leave a work in the back.
The ASA then felt it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happens to me when I was a teacher, it was not normal, I was not respected, I didn't respect my work.
I worked well with those ahead of Federation, but when Burleanu came to Federation came up with a pre-conceived idea, I didn't know, find out different views from the press about me.
It didn't change because it was very hard at that point, with the results we had, plus that was the financial situation in the middle.
I continued work, everything was going very well and he probably would have changed his ideas as well.
But I wanted to leave.
If I really want to stay, I then proposed them an increase in contract.
We have around 400 and something of thousands of euros per year, I was going to have around EUR 600 000.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.
"It was OK, but only if we finish first in the group," Victor Piturca said at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from national Romania in the autumn of last year, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 qualifiers.
Tehisman accepted the proposal to coach in Saudi Arabia, with him immediately taking over Al Ittihad.
Armoured and water cannon at the border
Hungarian police have deployed Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns on the border with Serbia, after violent clashes earlier on Wednesday, when water cannon and tear gas were used against migrants seeking to enter Serbia, despite Hungary lifting a razor-wire fence.
At least 20 police and two children were injured in the clashes, Russia's Zaman writes.
So far 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has taken two children who were injured after being dumped over the security fence.

Police tried to control water cannons and tear gas with crowds of people throwing plastic bottles, stones and pieces of pavement.
Authorities reported that several dozen migrants had broken the fence at the crossing between the Duke and Horgos towns and managed to enter the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto urged Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants on the common border.
There are reports that Serbs and Serbs have also gathered their border order.
In the wake of Wednesday's incidents, Budapest suspended the border crossing from Duke-Horgos for 30 days.
Hungary is in concerted action to close its borders to stem migrants' access.
If Tuesday announced that in addition to the barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia, it will lift one and on the border with Romania, to the fiery protests of Bucharest on Wednesday, the Hungarian prime minister announced the lifting of a fence and the border with Croatia.
Rare disease from which a man suffers
American Nick Hess was suspected of his family as an alcoholic, wife even filming him when he was dizzy, he could barely hold his feet and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he had not consumed alcohol, it was visible he was in ebriety.
When he first accused me of being drunk, without being drinking, I thought it was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe they drink by one, it's an alcoholic in secret'," he says, according to the Mirror.
When he saw the shooting of his wife with him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, just didn't recognise: "I look in my eyes and I wasn't there."
'it was awful, I didn't remember anything '.
In addition, his wife, who, although he has doubted a while of him, finally went with him to countless doctors, remembers as well as the breath of Nick mirosher of alcohol.
The moment that put him most vocal on Nick was when, after a minor crash when he had been hit by another car, he was found to have a blood alcohol three times over the legal limp, albeit a night before he had only eaten a single beer.
After years and endless investigations, it has been found that Nick suffers from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-Treasurer."
Basically, his body makes all carbohydrates consumed to fermented, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected this could be Nick's illness was even the wife.
The disease still does not have a cure, but since she gave up carbohydrates, Nick had no such episodes.
Smashed a Mercedes with a golf course
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest against the services he had on the side of his dealer.
The man has "attacked" his car with a golf course, causing enough damage for the car to be pulled out of use, sends BT.
The whole scene was shot and the clicking reached the Web, to the fun of those who watched him.
The man claimed the car had breakdowns that endanger his life and his family.
His sweat appeared when the dealer from whom he purchased the car didn't solve the problem, as he had been doing.
The government approved, on Wednesday, the "national immigration strategy for the period 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan on the Year," documents deemed to be "still a stage Romania is going through as part of efforts to modernise the immigration management process on national territory," according to a press release.
The source quoted as saying that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action directions that reflect the policies set at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the countries of the immediate neighbourhood of Romania, measures are being considered for the uniform and coherent management of situations stemming from the possible appearance of an influx of illegal immigrants into Romania's territory, resulting from crises of political, social, economic or military nature.
"The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will pay particular attention to citizens coming from countries with potential migration or which can achieve national safety," the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, the reactivation of the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the outlying areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets several general strategic objectives relating to immigration, such as: Promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls on the legality of the residence of third-country nationals on Romania's territory and the proper application of measures to move away and restrictive measures, the improvement of the national asylum system.
The national strategy also includes relevant specific objectives for the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: Facilitating access to Romanian territory of third-party nationals who respond to employment needs, favouring the access of third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for the areas and professions identified as flawed.
With regard to the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it is' a means by which concrete activities are set to lead to the creation of a flexible system for halting the growing migrant phenomenon '.
Romania in a European top job market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the biggest increase in the total cost of labour among EU Member States in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2014, according to data released by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat) on Wednesday.
The index is about spending on employers' staff.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total cost of the workforce climbed 1.9% in the European Union and 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third in EU to increase cost of labour
The biggest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU states where the cost of employment has fallen in the second quarter this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The rise in labour costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the cost of employment in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded a 5.8% increase in the cost of employment.
Labour leadership activity report rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks sacking
Parliament's culture committees rejected a report by the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for 2014 on Wednesday.
For rejecting the report, 17 MPs voted, one against rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be submitted to the permanent offices together.
They will decide, probably next week.
On the next plenary sitting, it will be debated.
"I think that given this situation will be made relatively quickly," said Senate Culture Commission Chairman Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was common sense" that the TVR leadership would be present at this meeting, while at the meeting of the Culture Committees, no representative of the TVR leadership was present.
It was common sense to be the presence of TVR, because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like this.
The invitation has been made to members of the CA since last night, with a approximate hour that we knew no new hour, but today, after the Happy Birth sitting, I personally sent a fax to the Swiss leadership inviting it.
I believe that when Esti summoned, you have been a budget worker, paid out of public taxes and Esti summoned to a committee meeting, even if you do not like living.
"Because it is your duty of service, Esti in an institution in charge of Parliament," Severin said after the session of Parliament's joint committee of culture.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the draft budget.
The debt we saw and as they continued, came up with the idea that this year it would have been on the day, but they didn't pay from the historical ones.
"I remind you that not from my fault or someone else in these committees has lost that leisure with the banks and the taxman, they are clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that after the work report was rejected by the plenary session, elections will follow for a new board of directors, and he will elect the director general of the institution.
I do not know who will be proposed for this position.
Miracles will not be done.
It is important to make political decisions so that this institution works.
I'm not the man to lie, let's tell you it's going to come up with a genius that's going to sit in the queue here and it's going to beat.
I hope that those who decide, Parliament's plenary, have their vote to choose with a great deal of sense on the people who will lead the Vlachs.
It needs to be people who know what's going on there, having experience and having a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I do not know who will be, if you ask me what qualities they have to have - good sense in attitude towards employees because it is a malware that comes from employees, complaints, redundancies.
"When you get such complaints 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation that is a disaster," the president of the Senate Culture Commission concluded.
Although he did not appear in Parliament, the president-general of the TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which it calls for Parliament to consider a number of measures that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexing of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase asks, in addition to indexing the TV tax, modifying and complementing 978 / 2003 on the tax on public television service, in the sense of updating the provisions on the level of technology changes to the day, as well as for regulating the procedure for control in the area of payment of the TV tax and the finding of penalties and the application of penalties and penalties.
He also wants a provision to be issued to provide for an extension of the requirement for all electricity providers to become SRTs to collect the TV tax, through the involvement of ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his opinion, there is a need to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the VAT.
Stelian Tanase is calling for a reduction in the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public broadcaster and the contribution for CNC from 15 per cent to the 3 per cent level, but also changes to the 41 / 1994 law, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budget / funding allowances for the acquisition of licenses for major cultural and sports events - the World Football Championship, Golden Connecticut, Eurovision.
He maintains that SRTv will default in the coming months as Labour legislation obliges the employer to implement court rulings, even if they are not definitive, and wage rights are facing priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has consistently made efforts to reduce spending with TV staff and production.
"So the trips and other cost-generating activities have been reduced, a number of commercial contracts have been renegotiated, and at the end of July, ABC News has been closed," the letter of the Austrian president said.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by its own efforts.
"Without the support of the state institutions - the government, Parliament, the presidency - Romanian Television will be, sooner or later, unable to carry out its public mission," the letter reads.
The head of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Culture Commission.
Vasile Blaga's gynecologist, sent to trial
Vasile Blaga's gynecologist, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to court on Wednesday by the Prosecutor's Office prosecutors in the Bucharest Court of Appeals.
He is charged with tax evasion, in a file with damages of about 680,000 euros, under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on 22 May.
He set up the NSW Security SRL firm, along with his mother, in April 2009, a year after marrying the daughter of Vasile Blaga, Agathe.
The investigation has emerged that, with the aim of evading taxes and taxes to the state budget, representatives of a specialised company in security services would have created a crime circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, which would have highlighted fictitious transactions.
"In fact, in accounting for the company, fictitious service purchases would have been recorded, which, in reality, were not provided, with the state budget being damaged by around 680,000 euros," the Romanian Police explained in a press release.

The Sept also realised that he was the best and would be wrong if you give up to him.
It would have been a variant to bring another player, much better, but he didn't come out.
"There were more discussions, like that with Mombk Boussoufa, but nothing has been done," Zatriojanu told Brei Sport.
Lucian Sanmaro reached Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Bishop has been voted vice-president at the Court of Auditors
Parliament's plenary voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Bishop, Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice president of the Court of Auditors at the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were recorded "for" and 108 "against."
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The PNL representatives were the only ones to vote against the proposal, reports Digi24.
In fact, the Liberals have criticised Bishop's appointment in this position and have announced that they will challenge it at the LNP, as he has a file at the DNA but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Bishop has 30 days under the law to give his resignation from the Senate, because the new office at the Court of Auditors does not allow him to make any more political.
The PSD senator will serve as vice president of the Court of Auditors' Audit Authority, left free after John Anton was revoked, following a decision by the September 2014 Constitutional Court, which found he had been called unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the most sexy actors: I grew up in the kitchen
How Bradley Cooper is set to play the role of a chef in the movie "Burberry," the actor made a revelation that his fantasies were not expecting.
In a recent interview, he said he grew more in the kitchen: "I worked a lot of life as a chef."
He has revealed he has worked in the kitchen since 15 years ago when she was working for a Greek restaurant, for then in college to continue on the same path.
The actor explained that her mother has Italian origins, so the whole childhood cooking with her grandmother's grandmother, reports ConcuttMusic.
Intrigued what plans to have in that period, Bradley Cooper said he never was the kind of man to make his five-year plans, "not even two."
"It's not a motivating thing for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you would laugh if I would tell you," he said, saying that what he wanted from childhood was turning.
Reached at the age of 40, however, the actor admitted he sees himself in the near future, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who had been walking away from Queensland at this age.
Ponta, accused of unchecked slams and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto strongly condemned Wednesday morning, Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's claims that political decision makers in Hungary are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries in which refugees are fleeing."
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational claims, offended the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slurs.
"His remarks have one explanation: He has lost his support in Romania's domestic politics," the head of Hungarian diplomacy added, according to MTI.
In a posting Tuesday evening on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention and sanction the conduct of senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his view, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not want to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives.
"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!" Ponta said on Facebook.
The Romanian prime minister added that he is advocating rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, noting that the brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and safety brutality will not solve the problem - it will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries in which the refugees are fleeing!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in recent days in Hungary is totally contrary to these goals and values!" The head of the Romanian executive stressed.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto qualified as "mere lies" with Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's remarks about Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis, noting that the claims were inappropriate for a 21st-century leader, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also noted on Tuesday that the Romanian prime minister's "extremist and misleading remarks" in Romania's domestic political crisis, and made it clear that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement by Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Monday.
What I have said and always say is that I am against the xenophobic speeches that we close borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are nonsense of the Middle Ages, and I am totally opposed to this approach.
If we can get more, we will get it, the problem is our logistical capacity to treat those people as people, not how they treat our Hungarian neighbours, with Bata and the insert.
"With that I disagree," the head of the Romanian executive said in a press conference in BuzzJiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest Government has decided to begin preparations in the field for expanding the border with Romania of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia, in order to deal with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to lift a fence at borders does not solve anything from the refugee issue and "get Hungary out of Europe."
What connection is there between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of Mecca's cranes
Saudi authorities announced that Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, is "partly responsible" by the collapse of a cranes on Friday in the Great Mosque in Mecca, a crash that 107 people died.
According to an investigative commission, the company did not "comply with safety rules," the Saudi news agency (SPA) reported, the BBC reported.
The company's directors have been given a ban to leave the country until the investigation is completed in this case.
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of former Al-Qaida terrorist network leader Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently headed by the brother of the former terrorist leader, Bakr.
Binoo Group is working for 4 years at the Big Moskeys expansion to be able to host more pilgrims.
The crash happened on Friday evening during a storm when a machete, probably lopsided by strong winds of wind, crashed on the eastern side of the Black Moskeys' roof at Mecca.
Following the crash, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How to shut them off the mouth of the challenge
Considered by many world the biggest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi has been labelled, after retiring from the work, as a poor coach, who cannot be able to perform in the new position as well.
After unhappy experiences at the national team, Star or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the coaching role at the Future of Constanta, the team they are sponsoring.
After a year after the team took over, King showed he was capable of turning a team that was lying to save from relegation in one of the top.
So after a year of days, the Future recorded, with Hagger, 16 wins, 11 rebounds and 11 defeats.
The Billionaire is one of a top team, which is knocking on European cups.
Things took an even better turn for the Future this season as the team reached second place in the League 1 with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attacking in League 1, with 20 goals (par with Glass), more than double than the Star.
On the other hand, even though he brought to the team more experienced players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the start-up team there were names like Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy has made the Future a team of watch for teams abroad, so Hagi has sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexander Mitrita (Bari - 500 euros).
Alongside Star Wars, the Future is the only profitable team in the Premier League, according to data from the Trade Registry.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
Large countries are coming up with solutions for the whole of the EU, says Cristian Ghea, a member of the college director of the Romanian Centre for European Policy.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghoud showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come from."
But they are the masses who have embarked on and we cannot return history.
Migration is a reality that we need to adapt to as well as possible and to adapt them to us.
In Cristian Ghea's view, we are at an extremely emotional moment where politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up freedom of movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: 'Schengen is now like an animal created in another age and which has not been adapted for the situation of now'.
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA council which, in fact, has not solved anything?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote on the board.
All the pronouns were saying they would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, in JHA, the principle of unanimity applies and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the EC has the initiative, and the board approves with the vote of 55% of states, namely 16, which account for 65% of the EU's population.
The calculations were saying the votes were there.
But they didn't want to go forward.
Because it is a sensitive issue, there has been a rejection reaction even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's opening policy and did not want in many countries to appear that an EU-type reaction sends us migrants to the head. "
They have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the governance of Schengen and we will probably see big changes there in the coming period.
So mandatory quotas were not really discarded, but the subject was just left to cooling?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement by Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also the German border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the limits to the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be dropped, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state in which it is the first time, because it is unsustainable.
If Greece is potting, you cannot simply say that it is Greece's job.
The problem is common.
Precisely because the problem is common, is it possible to resolve it without a precise, perhaps binding, mechanism for sharing the effort of the reception?
No one knows exactly how compulsory quotas will work, if they get to them.
Because it remains a problem: What do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I do not believe that the European states will be able to take the migrants on top of the migrants: You go to the country of X or in the country of Y.
There will probably be some single filtering centres, in Greece or in Turkey, where asylum applications can be applied.
It is working on solutions like this.
But the problem does not have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without any experience, as Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase their hatred.
The fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just started to go to Europe.
One estimate says that only 10 per cent were going to leave, winter is hard for the Mediterranean, but we expect the next year at a potentially even bigger wave.
What do we do with people?
My mum is that we're going to get used to this problem, we're not going to look so catastrophic from a media point of view.
Swung by countries with lower or higher experience.
Does it seem to me that there is any place where the integration of large groups from a supra-European culture really succeeded?
I look at the magreaves in France, to Turks in Germany, they are all in-depth.
I would not go towards radical statements.
Sure, their integration is more difficult than in other waves of migration, but that does not mean that they do not integrate at all.
It remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in the UK.
But pure means will not work.
Let us create the fortress Europe is illusory.
We must humiliate the integration mechanisms in European societies.
Here were some mistakes.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let them ask these people to learn the language, try to take up the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their home country, bringing the rest of the family, including through marriages of convenience.
However, the imminent problem of these people with the long-term problem of their integration must be separated.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it does not mean that we must look at them how they are drowning in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come from.
And if it's going to be an intervention in Syria, what I don't think, it doesn't mean it's going to recover the country overnight and you can take it back.
Until we defend solutions, we see the fortress within Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls are being erected, border controls are being re-introduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project at risk?
The European project as such is not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and arranging the rules so the pressure was too high on the countries where they put these migrants on foot for the first time.
That is, we are moving freely by Colo, but every e with her problems.
In the face of such a wave, this is not the case, because some countries are not coping.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show they do something, but in the long term it doesn't change much.
After the bombings in France, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It is a wave of public emotion that is being installed in both senses.
And it's so unstable from one week to the other that you can't make decisions based on them.
We have a lot of talk, many bellicous statements from politicians at home under the pressure to be viruses.
And then you have the dramatic case of the child drowned in Turkey and public opinion is moving.
After the public emotion goes through, we will return to the reasons why we have created this area, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the single European single market.
And I do not believe that Europeans will give up this principle of free movement.
That will be other rules.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another age and which has not been adapted for the situation now.
Is Romania how it has played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country, which believes that if it shoots as an eye and astings their ears, the theme disappears.
In the face of the reality of waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or to say that it is not your small country.
That is what we have done, it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
Don't Eknow, you don't play at home level.
Large countries come up with solutions for the whole of the EU, good or bad, and we are not talking about their quality now.
The SAA as Poland has done.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of Romanians for Schengen will decrease greatly.
President Joseph Hannis says it is perhaps good that we have not already entered.
So we move from the desperation to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is, of course, a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen for migrants to see us as an alternative route.
That does not mean that it is a reason not to enter Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but made in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, will be single rules for the acceptance of migrants, single deportation rules for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries deemed safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power of power.
She believes that being a great power means to confront Americans and Europeans.
From that point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to crash before his main opponent was the Islamic State.
Any two years have been a fight between the Assad regime and moderate secular and Muslim militias backed by Gulf and Western countries.
Then there was the Islamic State, and now we don't know if the Assad regime wants to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
It creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But Esti great power only if you have solutions.
The off-Side game is just a strategy to win time.
Putin is likely to be offered offers, apps him on the buttons to fix the situation.
The offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can somehow solve the issues created by him.
But I don't agree with the theories that say these people are mannered by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What a button to appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Yes" button, and now representatives of the social networking network are preparing another opposite, the "Disney."
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on his account that the button will soon be available, the New York Times reports on the blog.
Zuckerberg made it clear that the "Disney" button would rather show a nude of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg noted he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on his account an important life event, and someone else will give "Disney."
Network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long sought to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg has also said he is not very comfortable for people to give "time" to current events such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of a family member's death.
"You may not feel comfortable to give the weight of that posting," the Facebook representative noted.
The variant of a new Facebook button has not been welcomed by everyone.
"There's already enough hate on Facebook and social networking sites," commented Atkins Haneef of Afghanistan on the New York Times Facebook page, where the article was posted on the subject.
"I'm going to give 'Disney' the 'Disney' butt," he said.
Roger Anderson, an Atlanta microbiologist, argued there was nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at the eMarketer company, noted it was hard to imagine a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she claims, the campaign trail is approaching in America, and the "Disney" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands coming to the border at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyia Bakondi announced.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia because of the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing and announcing it would build a fence at its border with Romania, the DPA recalls.
The move drew a sharp reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they would logo the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you see, this is totally different," Serbian Refugee Minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Prior to the imposition of new immigration legislation, a record 5,434 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police announced Monday.
More than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa have also entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and trying to reach the West, especially in Germany.
"The new" county council headquarters is to pink.
Two builders, in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, with a view to moving the institution, sit down because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went into insolvency during work.
The headquarters of the County Council in the Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up alone.
A year and a half since the building work and the remanded of the building should have been completed, the work has not reached half.
A last stage in the cycle of the building was consumed last days when the National Security Council Resolution Board (CNSC) rejected a complaint by the firm who wished to take over the contract to carry out the technical project for the work that is still to be executed.
The original project was drawn up by Impex Rompupel SA.
After the builder's insolvency and the interruption of work, the negotiation procedures were launched without the publication of a participation announcement with Impex Rompupel, with the firm expected to update the technical project and then be held a new tender for the works.
"The negotiations, however, were not completed by a contract, CJ lauding that the proposed form would have put the institution at a disadvantage," said Razvan Carthal, who represented public relations within the CJ.
CJ's decision to break direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Rompupel.
The Victorian court has sent the complaint to the CNSC, which has rejected it, as a belated one.
That doesn't mean, however, that CJ can start searching for another projector.
Impex Rompupel has the possibility of attacking the CNSC's decision at the Court of Appeal, barely after a final sentence of it to consider finding another projector.
So work to strengthen the building could resume at least next year.
Our intention is to restart work as soon as possible.
In principle, the recovery of the technical project should not last long, but we must reach a contract.
"We are waiting to see whether the CNSC's decision will be attacked or not," Mr Nagy said.
Work to strengthen the former headquarters of Chestura Pollard began in 2011.
A first trailer was canceled in April 2012 after carrying out $4.5 million in works.
The tender was resumed, with the contract being secured by Moldoo SA.
The firm, however, entered the insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payments of 1.5 million lei were made.
The work has so far been achieved by around 50%.
Initially, the building work, reauthorization and the building of the building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.
"Ready, I say all!" - the statement that could criminalise the former Sefa de la Cadastray
One of the workers involved in the infamous file at the Cadastral Office signed an agreement to recognise the facts, against imprisonment.
Most likely, his statements will criminalise the other indictees, in the lead with former Sefa, Narciza Perry.
An adviser at the Ontario and Advertising Research Office (OCPI) Ibiza charged by the DNA in a corruption file has admitted to FAP Champion.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Damcalu was recorded at the Iowa Court yesterday, with judges setting up a solution in the case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dunscalu has been charged with false intellectual in his continued form and has agreed to execute two years of redemption with delay, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
As for Doubt's homicides, prosecutors have made it clear that he, as an adviser to the Cadastrian Office, along with other colleagues, "has falsely drawn up several minutes of acceptance, prising the C.P.I. IRL-based company administrators, SC Topo Euro-SRL, SC, CUC SRL, SC Topo Euro DRL, SC, the Waratahs and Tests Lipsa Stefan, which certifies have been fully realised, as they were not carried out and were not lodged at O.C.P.I. Ibiza."
Last days, the former Sefa Office of the Office, Narciza Olivia, but also other former or current UPI employees have been sent to court on this file, with charges being offset by some services to the listed firms, although the work has not been achieved.

Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major ballistic handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the women's handball team for qualification at the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
Romanian Handball Federation President Alexander Dedu said yesterday during a meeting with the media that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania's national women's handball team, "the main goal is qualification at the Olympic Games in Rio, but for that they have to go through two stages of bowlers and dine, primarily the World Championship and second, the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We want very hard to qualify for the Olympic Games.
There are fantastic requirements from the technical bullet led by Tomas Ryde.
Staf who will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants the back coach, a doctor, two mascara, coach of Portsmouth, the physical processor, head of delegation.
They have asked us to achieve the qualifications of some things, precisely materials for physical preparation, which I have never heard.
I do all to get to the Olympian Games, and I'll do everything I do to have them.
We are talking about a massive investment, there are many, many money.
But that's the way to do the performance.
Because at the moment we're in the Stone Age with preparation.
"The teams with which we don't deal with these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who noted that he was trying to get the sums needed to purchase these products from MTS and VR.
The president of FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
We do not have the Chamber in Bucharest.
It is a problem of infrastructure, and it is disgraceful that a European gymnastics Championship is called into question.
Let us not forget that in other corners of the world, Olympic neighbourhoods have been built entirely in a two-year period.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area in Barcelona, it was a rubbish dump, and now it has reached a landmark of Beauty.
It was the same in London, where the organisation of the 2012 Olympics was a success in terms of investment as well.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to give Romania a major competition.
It is a priority for me to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr Gatu has been in a civilised way with a project, people gave their consent in principle but quickly made it clear that he would never build the room.
I, too, have had discussions with IOF, we told them that we want, that we are capable of organising and they said that I agree and invite them to the first game in the new Chamber in Bucharest, and that is why we are talking specifically.
"So we have all the openness, and at IOF and the IHF, but we don't have the infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
The former top handball player has avoided assessing the chances of the women's CSM Bucharest teams and the Great Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be booked in the prognosis, that if they don't come back against them."
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian jihadists start on September 23rd, against France
National rugby team captain Mihai Macovei said in a press conference Tuesday that all of Romania's players are ready for World Cup matches in England, where they hope to get two wins: "We are ready."
Both I and my colleagues are with the engines of maximum turtle.
We trained to give the best yield in the four games.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Take it easy, the first time with France and then we'll see.
However, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I cannot, in words, describe the joy of participation in the World Cup, which has so many years of work.
I wish I didn't disappoint anyone in the Rugby family and come up with beautiful results at home.
"We want to be proud that some players, a small family like Rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolour," Macovei said.
Romanian national team manager Lynn Champion, who was at the first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of selected rugby: "It is a great honour for us to participate in this World Cup."
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
For me it's an extraordinary experience.
It is very important for me that every game makes Romanians proud of the national team.
The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Kas, has confidence that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the end of the event.
"These boys have started playing in Romania's teams on 18-19 years, so there is cohesion, it's a gang of friends, who have set their way to achieve a dream," Tas said.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will evolve in Group D, with the following games scheduled: With France on 23 September in London; with Ireland on 27 September in London; with Canada, on October 6th in Leicester; with Italy on 11 October at Exeter.
The competition begins on Friday at Twickenham Stadium in London, with England's match - Fiji in the group A.
New Japanese culture courses held at the University of "Al.I. Cuza"
About the flogging of the flowers in a vaza, painting in Optus, but also a gentle study about the country's beautiful arts, the Sun Rashas can learn at the courses organised by graduate students.
The circle of Japanese Culture Students in Ibiza organises new Japanese culture courses (ikebana, summertime and beautiful arts) from October 2015 to June 2016, courses for both beginners and people who are adept.
They will take place at the European Studies Centre of the "Al-I. Cuza" University in Iasi and are organised to promote Japanese, traditional and modern arts and culture.
For these, there is only one million-year-old participation fee per month.
Apart from art lessons, participants will be able to take part in the realisation of exhibitions and other cultural activities to promote the beautiful.
The Japanese culture courses that I have proposed have been designed as an invitation, addressed to the general public, to take the first steps on the road to self-employment through art.
"Interested people will be able to find out how to carry out the creations of the harmonious floral floral (ikebana), how to surprise the soul of the surrounding elements in plastic compositions using the Japanese art of painting in Optus (Summers) or how to express their own individuality and creativity through the plural universe of beautiful arts (graphic, drawing, painting)," said Sorin Mazilu, the professor of these courses.
The courses address all those who are passionate about art, regardless of age or experience.
Applications take place until September 30, and those who want to ask for more information can make it to the phone number: 0742,027,153 or email address: Www.gmail.com.
14 million Daddy's "St Spirit" Hospital in Iowa Budget
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The "St. Spirit" hospital received from the Ministry of Health, following budgetary discipline, about 14 million lions.
The money the medical unit has received to use them by the end of the year will be invested in works to upgrade and set up clinics, but also in equipment and medical technique for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
So the sanitary unit will be fitted with a new computer tomographer, with a new bowl of new radios, with six truses used for surgical interventions, six bedrooms properly fitted, a microscope-caliber microscope and other machines needed to carry out the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lions of the money received by the hospital will be directed to construction and landscaping works of "The Grand Ars."
From the money from the budget rectification, the UPU will receive 500,000 lions to complete the modernisation work in the main section.
"In addition, the coming days will make the reception of works from pasarela connecting the UPU from cardiology clinics, cardiatology and gastroenterology to ensure decent transport of the people of the UPU in neighbouring clinics," the medical unit manager explained.
The hospital will soon have a court and dermatology Clinic in Tatarasi, which it will organise in the ambulance, under the same form that it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where allergy is located, hematology and inology in the ambulance and will have about 30 beds.
The iPlayer, made by the RATP controllers and a touchdown.
Patania a tourist
A tourist family in Cluj came to Iowa to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, neither my wife wants to cook in your town anymore.
Without wanting, they have been hit by mischievous information, unsensing controller of the RAPT and, bonus, of a fine "as the so-called law."
The Suns arrived in Ibiza a few days ago, crammed into a Centre hotel and called for touristers.
They also got a touchdown in which RATP trails were crossed.
"Armed" with these maps, the wives visited the Isis.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to get to the Palas Mall.
Because it was not tongues with tickets to the station near Copou Park, they relied on printed information on the catcher: That they can take a ticket through SMS.
He has not told anyone that this service is no longer there.
Confident in the catcher, they climbed into a bus and tried to send SMS after instructions on the catcher.
Unfortunately for them, there has been a team of controllers RATP.
They said there was no more than 2-year-old service and that it was announced in the media that it was cancelled.
I know where SA know what has been written in local media, I coming up with an evening before I visit the city?
I spoke to the controllers, explained their situation, they said they didn't care, it's not their job.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said all I can do is give us a single fine instead of 2 (ml and wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to spoil my day visiting the gendarmerie and giving statements there!" Said Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was fined due to erroneous information on horseback and controllers who "applied the law to blood."
It's not fair, and I've made a reference to RATP Ibiza to recover my money.
It is not money, I am not overly happy, but the idea is that I felt cheated.
I am unlucky for the rapists in the Vaslui.
They had the accident and remained in cardiac arrest
The trial of seven rapists from the Cowboys moved, yesterday, to the Ibiza Court of Appeal.
Parramatta have tried the first trial term in an undisclosed session in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old woman have asked to be put at large.
Prior to the actual start of the courtroom, one of the extraordinary judges who had been assigned the file, Viorel Munteanu, formulated a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues at the court.
The magistrate has been sworn in this year at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was the chairman of the Pistorius section, he was the one who, on 9 April, admitted a dispute made by four of the defendants, with their placement under house arrest.
Currently, the file is judged by a full of which includes magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Raymond.
Previously, in the file she formulated a abstention and judge Dan Birton on the grounds that his daughter is in a relationship of competition with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that rapists from the Cowboys continue to remain in cardiac arrest.
Ti Cubs will remain jailed for at least another 30 days, when Jude Yorkers will re-discuss the possibility of putting them at large.
The trial deadline will be held at the Ibiza Court of Appeals on 6 October.
Before reaching the Ibiza Court of Appeal, the duba with which the rapists were transported from the Cowboys was involved in a crash in the Packers neighborhood, the car entering ISIS on the belt.
Autoslitara Iveco with whom the seven rapists were transported hit a Volks Commodore car floating on the street and the driver tried to cook on the left.
The Duba is moving from the end of the Packers.
The car went into Ibiza on the ground because the Penrith Fire Administration employees preferred the route from the Cowboys to Ibiza on graphene, then on the belt.
They have thus cut the road a few kilometres.
Immediately after the impact, escort arrested another shipment to take over the inmates.
Shortly, at the scene of the crash, a car was sent from Pennington High Safety Station, which took the seven inmates and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
In the aftermath of the crash, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other duba, the guards surrounded the rear side of the Masi Sharks, and the detains took off the speed, two by two.
"The incident has not been reported to Pollard because the drivers of the UA motor vehicles have understood amiable in terms of the damage to be paid," said Chief Commissioner Madalin Taranu, of the IPJ.
Big migrations
Romania is neither nor will it be ready for what to follow.
But Europe?
I say it from the outset, clear and clear: The 20 000 refugees they should and must naturalise Romania is, in itself, an insignificant but huge number compared to the ability of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, amounting to around 1 500 discards, is far beyond our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union in recent months.
Surely, if those migrants even accept to settle in our cities, the chances of rapidly integrating them into Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
I am convinced that they will be the first to lose their patience.
Parazed by mobsters and paralysed by a venomous political class, the Romanian state is proving bogged down in all areas.
Being able to integrate Gypsies is just a banal example.
In addition to that, governments of any colour have not been able to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, ensure decent medical care, raise the mess on the street, create paid jobs or keep their young generation home.
Why would refugees settle into another country in which it is running away?
But what makes a lot of wonder is particularly the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is being treated.
We are first hit by the bellicia of the EU's strong states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing the problems with smaller countries.
Then comes the friction of Romanians who, although they have millions of people scattered everywhere in the world, do not yet accept the other - another language, another religion, another blood.
He is probably afraid not to steal his carpets.
After all, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they cite only the horrors of war as a reason for the departure, do not accept any other destination of the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
However, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.
Likewise, the simplistic way in which the crisis is considered can only be mocked.
The causes must be removed, I support some and, by strictly speaking on the card of political correctness, call for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania, there is peace, and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why do they leave?
In this crisis, the European Union has been revealed to us as an anatomy, divisive and outdated construction.
I am complaining that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but the fact that neither the EU has any plans for the future.
And improvisation and threats don't help anything.
Then, what more is the EU using, if the only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - the right to free movement - could be put into question because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders as a cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the migrant crisis, however.
Over the coming decades, overcrowding, poverty, climate change, depletion of resources etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is neither nor will it ever be ready for what to follow.
7,000 euros a year to rent Club Pogor.
Destination, basically, imposed
The concession tender targets a 10-year period.
After 7 years in which he remained closed, the club in the court of the Romanian Literary Museum is provided by the county council for concession over a 10-year period.
Construction has a useful surface of 134 sq m, on two levels of hrube.
CJ accepts that destinations given to the building only the literary cafe, bookshop or other cultural profile activities.
The building was valued at 68.300 euros, with the starting value of the tender of 6,830 euros annually, with a 25m-euro bidder.
The directorate will have to continuously and permanently exploit the building and fully cover the rehabilitation costs of the building, in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
"The Manor Club building is in advanced state of degradation because of the fact that during these spaces, the public food unit has worked, and no further works of repair and maintenance have been carried out as they are routinely needed during the exploitation of a building," the tender documentation said.
The club's concession bids are expected until September 18th.
Two frenzy in Tomesti swallowed up salmon.
They were taken to hospital
Two 9-year-old children, and 11 years of Tommy, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the plaques in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was following a treatment and the pills were not hidden.
The children were taken to emergency at the "holy Mary" hospital in Iowa.
They are in stable condition, as doctors say.
Exclusive: A meeting that Iti breaks the heart.
At 20 he was given a brave gift: Biological parents
Lost in hospital in unclear conditions, in the non-hatred of the 1990s, when he had only two months of life, little, bolted and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years where adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman, now a blonde and beautiful girl, was reunited with the biological parents in a county village, after nearly two decades in which no one knew anything of others.
Crina will be in her 20s, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought to give their loved daughter a stunning and brave gift: A visit to Romania in Iowa to know her unclear past.
"The Ibiza newspaper," which assisted the family's search efforts after several highly vague hints, witnessed these meetings that virtually Iti rup the heart.
The coverage of reporters, the emotions of the bait, the statements of those involved, their reactions are downright slow and awesome.
The story of the Crash begins 20 years ago in the Victorian town of Prayer, which he was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be internalized in hospital, to the city.
At home, there began to be misunderstandings between parents and the mother had to parish her home.
He decided to keep the girl, and on me to send me from home.
He stopped the girl, and since then I didn't know anything.
"When I learned that he was in hospital, it was too late," recalls Rob Alina, the mother's biological mother.
Crina was internalized with her grandmother at the city hospital in Paskeys, and also then the girl's father, Cosby Balcan, left work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their buckets had to break up definitively.
They haven't found Crina at the hospital
After the internment, the father of Crash had gone to work elsewhere, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the Iowa hospital and the father, when he returned, did not find it.
I think he had been waiting nearly nine months since the girl was in hospital.
"I would have thought it was abandoned," says one granddaughter of the family.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother was unable to come up with Crina in Iowa, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one was more interested in the fate of the child during this time, she was taken over by the Directorate-General for Social Assistance and the Protection of Isis Child, which then gave her to care for the Sleeper Center in Bucium.
They were years when leaving and adoption were less regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by the Lib Dems and his wife, a couple in Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not succeed.
They fell in love with Blonde Crina, and after some time she had to move permanently with them to Italy.
The little has already been spent almost two years, how long the adoption formalities took place.
When I saw Crina, I felt like it was our face.
"As if my wife would have given her life," says Smiler, the adoptive father, as he catches in the palm of his hand-shaking hand.
In the country, the parents of Crine, Alina and Cosby, continued their search separately, each on where she was able to.
The father asked the authorities in Prayer but did not receive any answers where his child could be.
Police then told him that it was possible to be bullied, but in Iowa parents learned what really happened to them.
When I looked at it here, they told me at the Court that it was gone to Italy, in Palermo.
And the conditions to look for I didn't have.
We asked God to be fine.
I thought about her in all the years that passed, but there were no possibilities for umblam, to find it.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in the eyes of Crash's biological mother.
But even if the years passed, the parents of Rugby were not forgotten.
In Italy, Commodore and wife explained to her face where it comes and that her past links it to Romania.
I was small when I learned.
I think we had five or six years.
I reacted like a cops, I was curious.
"I wanted to know my parents in Romania," says delighted Crina.
And her dream was going to become reality.
In March this year, Chief Commissioner Romica Ierner, director of the Regional Center for Disease Prevention, Review and Antibiotic Adventure, was contacted by an acquaintance in Italy, which explained the Lib Dems' desire to find the biological family of Crash.
And the search just started from a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
Primisem only a name, Balcan Costica, then the locality, Prayer.
Soon we had a work with the City Hall there, and I was able to ask if there was by all the names received.
Then they gave me a few indications, only that the person found was not the most desirable.
"It took until nearly a month of days until we find the biological father of the face," explains Chief Commissioner Romica Ierner.
In all, more than three months have taken authorities to find Cosby and Alina, especially that they are residing in another locality.
We started the move somewhere in March, and in the months of June and July, we completed the identification of biological monks and discussions.
"Then we determined that a first meeting was held in September," added Romica Ierner.
In the weekend that passed, Alina and Cosby saw her first face lost on the hallway of the Iowa hospital 20 years ago.
The father, excited, was barely able to contain his tears, and the hands of the treadmill continued.
It's just changing a few words with the surrounding.
A week before the meeting, they were not even able to sleep.
He was all excited, I hate.
"To be able to see the child after so many years, it's something," she tells us a granddaughter, cast and she with Cosby's Prayer.
Meeting the Crash with mother and biological brother
In talks with the girl, who is expected to study at a well-rated university in Italy, Cosby Balcan told him, among other things, that if he once wants to return to him, in the village, to come quiet: II can give something sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and claw a household.
Her mother and she moved, she cries, and she thinks it's hard that something like that can happen to them.
I'm very embarrassed.
I didn't think it could happen like that.
I've seen such cases on TV, I've been thinking about these years, I hoped, but I didn't think I could be so.
They are very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope that we will visit us in the future.
"I hope that we can keep a connection," he tells us with great tears on the obitui Alina, the mother of the Crash, while holding a hand in hand.
He also hides his tears, thankfully, because soon he will see her face after so much bitter weather.
On the other side, Crina, who will be over just a few days later this month, 20 years, is trying to relish like an emotional child.
He doesn't know what to expect but he has sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting they are trying to collect their thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are up to the end of those who have grown me up.
It's going to be a nice encounter, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a nice memory with them, because now I'm so many things to say," he tells us Crina.
First family reunion in Iowa
In Uncle Square, under the skies of the autumn beginning, the Prairy family once again unites their destiny with their face in Palermo.
Crina now has 20 years, finishing high school, after the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Cosby, her biological parents.
There are no longer borders or countries, but only a barrier: That of language.
Fish, with the help of an interpreter, an Italian homeowner at the centre of Isis, have easily passed.
Those who managed to make this meeting say that it is the first event of this kind, and that, in the future, if there is an opportunity, they will do it.
It is the first such event, which is also organised, and I am pleased to be successful.
We at the Centre have different activities, and most often we are associated as an institution that is only dealing with consumer people, drug addicts.
But we're trying to restore society something good back.
"If I'll be asked for such an event, I will do it with great pride," says smiling Romica Ierner, director of the Regional Center for Disease Prevention, Review and Antibiotic Adventures.
Behind him, Balcan's family, with Crina in the middle, are walking away.
I'm understandable: They have a lot to say to each other.
Armistiu with his arms at the leg, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everyone gets their soul
Camps in the PSD branch of the PSD sealed a gunshot wound to the leg.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first and most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Sprinkled by the party's executive chairman, Liviu Dragnea, to show a united position, the extraordinary Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for party posts.
Far from over, the internal war in the party appears to have taken just a break to allow combatants to draw their soul.
Dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
It has launched a very simple and very current message in the current conditions: You are trying to find a solution in order not to jeopardise the party.
On 3 October, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who will want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," Acting Mayor Mihai Chirica said.
The two days of weekend talks only led to the conclusion that nothing has been set.
In October's elections, for president of the PSD's county branch, fierce competition is expected.
On the short list of potential candidates for the main post in the party's outstanding branch, Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, county councillor Vasile Catea and interim chairman of the County Council, Victorel Lupu, are in the party.
The mayor of the como Schitu lead, Mihai Mihalache, could also be added to them.
A decision taken in the calculation is the candidacy of the leader of PSD's county councillors, Cristian Stananov, if Lupu no longer enroll in the race, with party sources saying he is not interested in office.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of former branch leader George Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, including on the day of the elections, applications can be submitted, and would not replace anyone if it happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will also remain after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Office, a new county Permanent Office and all new leadership structures," Catea said.
Until the internal elections are held, the leadership of the PSD's county branch will be secured by Victorian Lupu, a close to Nichita and Stanchev.
Lupu, however, are on leave until 29 September, with the preparation of the elections to be secured by the executive secretary of the branch, County councillor Mikhail Popescu, in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by phone, Cristian Stananov praised the talks in recent days, leading to "a partial consensus."
There is broad willingness to maintain the balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus has been reached in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.
"But on the other hand, there are several options concerning the intentions of the PSD-based PSD presidency, the list remains open," Stanchev commented.
Fremantle judge has refused the rapists file in Vaslui on grounds of no binary
The seven young men in the NSW County convicted of rape arrive at the Iowa Court of Appeal today.
Vasluiinians sentenced to penalties between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments on their implementation today, after the basic court, Justice Prosecution, established their imprisonment immediately after sentencing.
The file was recorded at the Court of Appeal late last week, with Judge Dan Anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton cited the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the partner of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the highest penalty in the file.
How the judges motivated the ruling
Late last week, the presiding judge, who sentenced the seven youths, motivated the ruling.
The judge discusses the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also those who supported them, saying such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among public opinion.
"The court finds that after the time being conducted under the preventive measure of judicial control, the restrictive measure of freedom but not a lack of freedom, in the impact of the attitude of defendants, their families and local supporters, it has been felt at the level of the local and national community with a strong sense of indignation that people accused of serious facts are judged under a less restrictive measure," the motivation of the Vaslui Chamber said.
The magistrates also dismantled and the main defence of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be "church door."
"The sublime court is not relevant to the relevance of the moral quality of the injured person, something that the defendants wanted to emphasise through the appearances they have formulated, as a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," the motivation said.
Corbyn, Brexit and Europe's Future
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed over the last few decades cannot continue the same way in the coming years.
By Saturday, a little world knew in Romania who is Jeremy Corbyn.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many wonder to what extent it can affect our choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a position position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of post-war Labour.
The declared, anti-monarchy (asked him at one point to Tony Blair, then the prime minister, to take the royal family out of Buckam Palace), a rude anti-American and a sympathiser of Vladimir Putin (was otherwise invited regularly to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today"), and the terrorist movements of Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to abandon nuclear weapons and emerge from NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
After the pattern of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things of the kind that they were saying and promised and Tsipras in Greece until the time he gave the chest to the real world and economic legalization.
The economic programme of the new Labour leader provides, among other things, massive renationalisation and money printing as a solution to financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Sure, some might wonder why the solution with the printing of money is not unanimously adopted across the globe, we would then have a global general prosperity!, but who would no longer prevent such details.
Of course, we can charge the blood on bankers, you become a kind of enemy of power of the Left, but as far as it has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the terms of Jason and Hollande.
The extra sums are quickly swallowed by generous, no-cover promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher pointed out, "the issue of socialism is that at one point the money of others ends."
Few give real chances to Jeremy Corbyn to ever get the prime minister.
In the early 1980s, another radical left-wing leader, Michael Foot, who anyway wasn't as extreme in belief as the party's new leader, failed miserably in the election.
And then there is still in Britain a working class, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential than now.
Under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the workforce, and extensive automakers have made the industry a massive need for high-skilled working hand, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited call.
But even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
In its latest Financial Times, the election of Corbyn increases the chances of Brexit, and Britain's exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical Left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed the austerity of the poor.
When combative this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and you look at the refugee crisis that rocks the EU, you reach an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide in the wake of the referendum, which would be held by 2017, to leave the Union loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep tremors created inside it by the euro crisis and now that is why refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for scenarios of the most worrying.
All the more so as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterpoint to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin is increasingly becoming the dominant player).
True, the British business environment, the City, are strong lawyers for the country's remaining in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the one in the past.
There are many resentment, rising in intensity even in those weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we even recently had a specimen in the speech by Jean Cluj by Junker, is increasingly inclined to make major decisions over the head of the vast majority of Member States, with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And that's when electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time and Eurosceptic is growing dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative cargo has reached higher rates than ever in the past.
Where and the conclusion the Financial Times draw when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that leaves the national interest.
If voters make the decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in the current policy.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we will see more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the states in the region and the periphery of the interest and to that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States are feeding their populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in oocious societies.
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed over the last decades, generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same way in the coming years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the euro area - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that have not taken into account than the integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and readiness of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and damage Romania's situation.
And it's hard to dismiss something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brancusi, Sept.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brancusi: "Takes and mature the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: To be someone, to get famous, to hear about him all over the world.
Behind the recount, however, is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered, recipes for success in life.
That something also has a name.
It is called "truddles."
What to write about Constantin Brancusi?
What is more to say, in fact?
His figure appeared on the banknotes.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania has hired an actor to play him in a publicity stunt.
Brancuand produces and deliver money nearly 60 years since it is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulders carrying their names.
Incidentally, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when it comes out of the lads, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, at Brancuand."
The country is crowded with its statuettes.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by the same world, from children, to the elderly.
Brancusi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Neither the Communists managed to excel Romania's memory and culture.
Its cités are today lining up the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of SMEs and SMEs.
And then again, what would he actually be to say about this man?
Seen from the pile of books and articles trying to recreate their destiny, Brancusi's life looks almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, I'm those people who tell you that if you didn't have the luck to play in any big city and in a family as much as you can, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
Brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe that's where it would be a key.
Perhaps the text that is coming from here should be started.
With a sentence, however palatable they are.
Uses the success stories of the creature, which will be delivered daily in newspapers and on TV.
Watch the figure of this man carefully.
Do you know how to succeed in life, how, today, has he heard a whole world?
It is simple.
He has worked all life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brancusi is born on 19 February 1876 in Hobita, a small village in the Common Pestisani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
It is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancusi.
Although it came from a family of wealthy peasants, Brancusi takes a modest life, but one of which he had to reap his repertoire will guide her late-story vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places where she grew up, the artist had to confess, in a meeting with Petre Tutea, from Paris, from 1933: "On then life was beautiful and harmonious."
For millennia, people were moving, happy, a patriarchal life.
It was all crossed from one season to another.
And do you know why things have changed?
The fascination of the great city has come to us.
Brancusi's Copilaria, however, was far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these years of life is highly indicative of the combination of purity and violence that characterised the future sculptor years in his native country.
The moment is reproduced in the "Brancusi," a biography, "written by Alexander Bujar.
In 1879, Constantin Brancusi had 3 years.
In the autumn of that year, when the tube was made "at the Broncos," watching those who sample the liquidator to see if the process unfolds as they need, Brancusi catches a moment of general unconscious.
They fill their cascades with tubes and drink on the nerves.
It falls in sleep almost instantly.
The first people only notice after a few minutes.
The mother enters the panic, then in hysteria, believing that the son had died.
Towards the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from live accompanied by lauts, he sees the desperate signs of those who eagerly await him in his mouth.
The party is immediately turning into jale.
The father is already thinking about Hull.
However, someone finds that it is well based on Baba Brandusa, the sheep and servings of Brancers.
Brandusa checks the baby's breath, then puts him under the bouquet of horse, gathered from the pub.
The baby is strong.
The world applauds.
As the boy is left to sleep over the beast, of joy, the party with lenses continues with even more force.
The second day, father and son meet through Orchard.
Radu Brancusi puts Constantin to collect some nude and bring them up.
The father captures her baby with her head down and, with the nuances brought by the boy, is knocking him out to keep her mind.
And while it feels the garment of blows, the small Brancuand has the revelation that the world can also be seen from another perspective and that things around can come down.
Especially the sun's position, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he had to admit in old age, if not the Blues himself take part in the disturbance.
Would the sun have been as disturbed as his father of what happened to him? "
At the moment, the city doesn't work
An MP calls for politicians to remember those who voted them.
Independent MP Viorel Blhelp called on the PSD and PNL to stop infighting and refocus their agenda to the electorate.
What we are seeing now on our political scene is a big division and both.
I haven't seen anything from the USL projects in 2012 to continue.
Neither the highway nor a Regional Emergency Hospital, you see only how politicians dispute their possible sites according to real estate interests.
Let us leave a little bit of politics, gather and talk.
At the moment, the city is not working.
"If Ed was busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," Blhelp said.
He appreciated that the current political class has disappointed the election class, with a result expected to be a very low turnout in the upcoming local elections, around 30 per cent, representing virtually the faithful electorate of the parties.
The MP also believes that voters will move back to mainstream parties, expressing reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "For Ibiza" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break up from the right of the right, not the PSD.
Such parties rely on civic active people, who rule are right.
"It turns out even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for the PSD," Blhelp said.
He has made it clear he is not interested in a bid for upcoming local elections, denying rumours of his intention to enroll in the mayoral race.
I have said that I do not want to run for any local office.
I am thinking of whether to continue as a Member and in the future term.
I tried to call for unity for ISIS and in the discussions on the hallway, with the other MPs, and I was accused of wanting to make my picture.
I don't want, but we can't go on like that anymore.

A colleague from Tatarasi said he didn't get his money and he has to go by bus.
Let us not be hypocritical.
There is no money.
Sometimes I feel ashamed to raise the money from Cairns.
At the end of the term I will make a report with everything that we have spent, outside the salaries of employees from the cabinet and its maintenance.
It happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lions, with all the transport breaks, accommodation and the others.
"To tell an MP that they don't get their money to clean hypocrisy," Blhelp concluded.
