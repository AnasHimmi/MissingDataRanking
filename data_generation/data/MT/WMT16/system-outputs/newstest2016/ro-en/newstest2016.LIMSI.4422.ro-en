UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution to the conflict" which has lasted for nearly five years and more weapons would not exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief has again called on all parties, including the Security Council divided the UN to unite and to support the negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday at a conference that he plans to meet this month with the foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the edge of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions in council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this intractable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity displayed when they failed to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thereby addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures in the polls show that Donald Trump has a good chance
Some have tried to label him as a politician "flip-flop."
Others have called him a joke.
And others are waiting for implosion.
But regardless of how some republicans are trying to remove him from Donald Trump in the polls, has not worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads with a ratio of two numbers and some are starting to seriously wonder what does this mean for the chances of appointment of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still premature.
None of this is not to say that Trump will win the race for republicanilor nomination.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, the advancement of Rick Perry to Herman Cain in the polls, but neither won in any state in the race for the nomination.
And why would they fight hard for the general election are numerous.
But outside groups such as Super CAP of Jeb Bush and the economically conservative Club for Growth acknowledge the power of Trump and begin to support him with money.
Still give you a few figures in recent polls suggesting that real estate mogul is not just passing something:
The figures show that support for Trump returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump to announce his candidacy, in mid-June, a poll conducted by Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 republicans had a positive opinion about real estate mogul.
Until mid-July, the percentage rose to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative view.
These figures are maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa found that 60% of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump would win the race for the nomination.
In a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of republicans have said they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" whether Trump would win the race for the nomination.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if Trump would win the race for the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm for Trump (43% say they would be "enthusiastic" compared with 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
The closest in terms of excitement?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other side, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "disgruntled" or "upset" if front-runner Jeb Bush wins the race for the nomination.
Most republicanilor does not consider his temperament Trump a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticised for the insults and his style add, 52% of Republican voters nationwide believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to the survey released Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
Find the same numbers in Iowa, where 52% of republicans believe that Trump has the right personality to be leading, according to the survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% agree that it does not have the necessary personality to act effectively and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament does not belong to the White House, according to the ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When taking the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters believe that Trump is authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, who is most likely to win the race for the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: in the past, GOP voters have not read very well for the future.
During the same period of the last elections, four out of 10 republicans have tapped Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP voters see plausible campaign of Trump.
Even if Republicans or back to another candidate, Trump still tops all.
Some say that the split is likely to contribute to the victory of Trump, while support for Trump will be split into more than a dozen candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by Monmouth University shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and the other Republican candidates, almost always Trump will receive majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, on 19 points of Jeb Bush and, ultimately, to 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It is almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation of one to one.
Most of the supporters of Donald Trump says it has been decided.
A new poll released Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of voters who support Trump says they do not change the option of voting.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard, and no one can say that they do not want to change their minds again.
46% say that leaves portița open the possibility of changing their choice.
However, the most important opponent of Trump is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but is twice as likely voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 republicans say they agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
When Donald Trump called on immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in an opening speech of his campaign, two months ago, immigration was the topic in the campaign for 2016.
Some are worried that add style of Trump will lead to a split between hispanici senior voters and the Republican Party and will harm rebranding efforts.
But, according to the survey conducted by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of 10 republicans say they agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, as will remain, and Trump Doland.
Frustration reaches new culmi.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their outsideri status.
According to the survey conducted by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of 10 republicans say they prefer a political outsider at the expense of someone with experience in government.
People are also angry with the authorities in Washington.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa for the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four republicans in Iowa are frustrated by republicanilor performance in congress, 54% pleading "disgruntled" and 21% "nervous at culme."
Jeremy Corbyn makes its debut at Prime Minister's questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn debut at PMQs has long been expected
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will make its later debut at Prime Minister's questions, seeing for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of six questions about who has the right shortly after lunch; his performance is likely to be closely examined by the media and Labour MPs.
In the weekly aparițiilor, he urged "less drama and more."
He also said that he could give up some participation and that they succumb to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbyn in a leadership position, coming after he appointed a "shadow cabinet" and after the speech he gave Tuesday at the annual congress tuc.
Meanwhile, the leader of the Labour Party to silence the speaking national anthem during a service held Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted criticism from some Tory MPs and made the front pages of newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn decision not to sing national anthem pointed out
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he "has kept silent respectfully" and acknowledged "heroism British Air Force in England Battle."
However, a member of the shadow cabinet of Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, told the Two's BBC Newsnight reported that he had advised Labour leader to sing national anthem of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around a dozen cabinet ministers refused to take part in the leadership of Mr. Corbyn, arguing with differences of opinion about the economy, defence and foreign, while less than one-sixth of parliamentary party has supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin brant, says the political "gets" in Labour after the appointment of Mr. Corbyn on his position in the European Union and the benefits.
Mr. Corbyn said at the conference tuc that Labour will bring changes that will completely eliminate the idea of limiting.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Work and Pensions Minister, said the party "is very clear" solely in opposition to the government's plans to reduce the 26.000 pounds to 23.000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader facing David Cameron speaking in the last decade, when he assumed the leadership of the Conservative Party.
Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from external sources" for questions to ask Cameron God, and that he has received more than 30000 suggestions.
Islington North MP said that PMQs involves a very high level of confrontation and that it will refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take place at PMQs when he cannot attend - for example when Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also expressed the view that will allow others to speak occasionally, saying that he had addressed to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he assumed the leadership, Mr. Cameron said that he wants to give up the political style of "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs but acknowledged a few years later that he failed in his approach.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, PMQs was considered a key barometer of the reasoning of a leader, how he leads the Chamber of Deputies and its position among fellow lawmakers, although critics say it has become a caricature, and that requires a deep reform.
"Framework in Joburg": homeless youths enjoy photography courses
It is difficult to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood have found a way to learn a profession and to earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio to teach homeless young people to take photos of areas where they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports says higher wages could harm expansion
Chairman JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that an increase in the minimum wage in Britain could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, it is unlikely that the purchasing power to overcome the higher costs for the workforce within the firm, he says.
The costs could have an impact on the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and criticised for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was collateral victim in "storm" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behaviour deserves more words of praise and criticism, Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest of the talented duo set often called "KS,," was dragged into disagreeable in the spotlight by a scandal in which Kyrgios derapajul played with Stan at the Montreal Masters.
In a very hard playoff match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the referee seat had to intervene twice in order to split the Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: "ought to put him down on Kyrgios, and I would have to be put down on puștiul."
Although the last time was seen as a powder rocket after crampe took and missed a possible US Open tournament, angered Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was adamantly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is fighting with Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
"One thing I feel strongly that it is, in my opinion, Thanasi was caught a bit at odds," Healy said.
The truth is that he has broken a rocket when he lost because he was charged in US crampe, but it is not the first player to break a rocket in frustration with himself and I know the Thanasi well enough to know that it would have been proud of it.
But come on, it has permeated extremely well in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so forth, and I think they deserve more trust.
He has a great team, has a great family together and I think that has been treated unfairly.
It is a very mature young man of 19 years, he works hard and has been integrated into the team, had no conflict with other players, is highly respected in the changing rooms, trains hard, is in an excellent form, is a very balanced and mature young man, and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of its qualities and defects.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take into account the Kyrgios remiză important match, which begins on Friday, and described "joint decision" as the most suitable for everyone, but claimed the return from Canberra player long-term team.
"First, we want the team to focus entirely on remiză game and not thinking at all about the controversy around him [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick has moved very quickly, as people have said such as Federer and Murray, he is under public scrutiny and has made some terrible mistakes and deserve to be criticised, but we are trying to support them, we are trying to help him to understand the consequences of his deeds, and I think it needs a time in which it is located in the centre of attention in order to be able to reflect, which is good for both the team and for him.
Election 2016: the advantage of Hillary Clinton in front of Bernie Sanders has been reduced to half in national polls
Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, is still an advantage of two figures in the democratic race for candidacy at the national level, but Senatorul Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the primary election, a majority of Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that it has been decided on the candidate they support.
But Clinton's supporters are more resolute in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
In a poll conducted by CBS news last month, Clinton has lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percentage points.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among men has been considerably reduced and Sanders is at a distance of only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 years has evaporated, and is now on par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still on edge among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures, among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight advantage of 5 points in this group.
About half of Democratic voters nationwide say they would support it with enthusiasm for Clinton if he would be elected to run in the name of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it is the party.
Six per cent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood of Clinton's current supporters to be enthusiastic about her election is high.
Opinions are mixed in among those who do not support a currently on Clinton - only about a quarter would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would support it with enthusiasm for Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same thing about Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When Clinton's supporters are addressed an open question about why they would like her to win the race, the answer is that it has adequate experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that is the best candidate for the post (10%).
Clinton's supporters and mentions her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
It also mentions the agreement on these issues and eligibility.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential bid, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although one-third believe that we should not run.
The question on the second option for the party, voters Democrats call it a majority on Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say that Biden would be the second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the race for the Democratic Party, the advantage of Hillary Clinton in the face of growing Sanders, 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if it does not apply.
55% of Democratic voters see Clinton as the most likely candidate to win the general election; however, the numbers have dropped from 78% last month.
Biden is away in second place, but the percentage that is the most eligible rose.
However, when I asked what is most important for an elected candidate, Democrat voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no Democrat candidate or potential candidate is not considered by these voters as unacceptable as the representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well in terms of some key characteristics from the primary voters of their party.
The majority of voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden as of integrity and trust and solid leadership qualities.
Biden is best seen among all three in terms of integrity, while the strength of Clinton's leadership.
30% of Democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integră and trust, twice more than those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters also believe in general that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideology as them.
On all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist about the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State, the majority of voters Democrats are satisfied with their explanation on the subject and say that it has not affected their overall opinion about the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about one-third are satisfied.
Public opinion has been divided in March on this issue, shortly after the issue has surfaced.
Most Americans say that the controversy over email did not affect overall opinion about Clinton, while 36% say they have changed their opinion in the negative sense.
Mainly Republicans, more than six in 10 say they have changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative sense.
While Democratic voters believe Clinton integră and confidence, it continues to raise questions among voters at a general level: only 32% considered integră and reliable, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not see a integră and trust.
At the same time, 55% of voters nationwide do not consider Trump upstanding and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump have the ups for leadership.
Of the six candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush ranks first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider the upstanding Sanders is higher than those who do not agree, but as in the case of Carson, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 of Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the Brotherhood indicted for murder in the year 1 student at Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Brotherhood IDPs from the Baruch Faculty in New York attacked him brutally Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and stopped to take him to the hospital, which has contributed to his death, according to police.
Official sources say that the victim was tied to the eye, he was placed behind a 14 kilograms rucksack filled with sand and was bullied repeatedly while trying to move towards a target on a frozen pitch.
Mr. Deng was accused of head pain after they lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Brotherhood IDPs have not called the emergency number after he fainted and claim that they waited an hour before they go to the hospital, said police.
They found, however, the time needed to change her clothes of Deng, to seek his symptoms on Google and to contact him on Andy Meng, President brotherhood at the national level, in order to seek advice, police chief, Chris Wagner, said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to conceal their personal belongings and basically blamed the Brotherhood before Michael's good Deng," Wagner said.
He could not be revived and died the next day morning.
According to a report by autopsie, Deng has suffered repeated trauma to the head, log and coapse.
"Considered many families have been devastated by frățiilor rituals, in 1970 at least one student died each year due to ritual," said Douglas Fierberg, the lawyer for the family of Deng, in a statement.
Frățiile and their members should be held accountable and that the measure taken by authorities is important.
The grand Juriu Monroe district has recommended that the first five members to be charged with second-degree murder.
Thirty-two other mebrii of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be indicted for disrespect and complicity in murder.
"We want to held accountable not only the individuals involved, but if there is an organisation which has authorised brotherhood, formally or informally, will also hold accountable," Wagner said Tuesday at a press conference.
Baruch has banned brotherhood and national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with local representation.
This is what happens when the Fed will raise interest rates
The interest rate will rise and the bull market (rising market) will be red, bond returns will rise and the economy will enter recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long it will happen and how long it will take.
In economics, history offers few clues on time.
After the first would increase interest rates, the recession has occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor of how the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, central bank officials in the US have increased so strongly that investors should focus on when it starts to raise interest rates but the trajectory of time needed for normalisation.
Indeed, at stake are multiple variables.
But, ultimately, the players in the market may find that all the fuss about rising interest rates has been exaggerated.
"First increase of interest rate determined by the EDF after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of age" cheap money," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
Instead, we do not expect gradual return of interest rates in the US to more normal levels, but still to be seismic shock which seem to fear all.
But it is not possible to say that there will be no effects.
Further explain how they might react a few sectors of the economy, based on historical trends:
Bearing in mind the situation faced by the market in recent months, the anticipation of rising interest rates can volatiliza things for a while.
But, at the time, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a trend for the profitability of capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first rise, which may reflect again defazajul in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what will happen after the EDF increases.
Specifically, in the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by about 14 per cent - moving towards a higher interest rate, pretty invariabilă during the period of 250 days after (up an average of 2.6%) after which returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 per cent, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by chief strategist for Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said that the impact on equity tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rising interest rates and the benefits are starting to fall.
The recession is a fact of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the present situation, the EDF faces some conditions that have not existed before, and which could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, the gross domestic product will be closer to its historic low point for an increase in the interest rate the EDF.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 increases in interest rates after 1950, only twice in nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 amounted to 3.6 per cent, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the EDF Atlanta.
Rising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
The players in the market throughout the year were prepared for a decision from the EDF, all eyes this week for a meeting of the Commission Federal Open Market, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists agree that the FOMC may approve an increase in the interest rate at this meeting, futures trading indicates a probability of only 25%.
"In our study conducted in 1950, all the growth cycles of interest rate so far has been in a super cycle of profit growth, GDP dwarfing mountain tops before the recession very quickly after the start of recovering," the report said.
Instead, it was a strange slow recovery after the worst recession in the period under review.
This current cycle is by far the longest wait for the EDF at the end of the last recession; it was the record of 35 months, and it has reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is more quickly than in the case of actions in the case of bonds when the EDF modifies its policy.
In the case of Bonds, it seems that the benefits of changing direction once it produces the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of rising interest rates, bond returns immediately falling," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategies agree that these increases in interest rates will determine the profitability between short-term bonds and the long-term, aplatizând curve.
Bonds with high profitability is doing better in such an environment, although "are still cautious about forcing profitability," said in an analysis Kathy Jones, an analyst at fixed income at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones agrees that the markets have already been adapted to the expectations of the EDF.
"In addition to dollar strength and lower inflation estimates, there are few signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of a tighter monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Interest rates on short-term increased profitability curve is fairer, spread-ul average interest rate of credit has been extended and volatility has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the EDF tightens policy.
Overall, companies operating in the US will benefit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with big debts will have to suffer because the rising dollar will lead to prices of their products in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial surge of interest rate," said analyst Goldman Sachs in a report to clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets overtook those with a weak balance sheet after each of the increases of the interest rate in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with big business in the capital as well as low volatility stocks have also passed similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
The debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a large percentage of flotantă debt lost most of all, says Goldman.
Consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Those who save could also benefit, although experts may not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after FM Classics, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticised the radio station for "prostește"
He says it is becoming increasingly similar to commercial challenger
He also made the BBC Music Awards, saying that the Brits were plagiarism
My colleague Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, saying that this issue is not original
BBC Radio 3 "turns into" FM Classics, said a senior MP, putting pressure on the post to prove that it is doing something that commercial broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has also sent BBC bosses that public radio station "prostește" and increasingly resembles commercial opponent.
"I think Radio 3" prostește "- although I do not like to use the word - but I have the impression that turns into FM Classics," he said.
He also made the BBC Music Awards, launched last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, launched last year, appear to be Brits under another name.
So, if you are trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind which merely duplicate what is already on the market, "said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC has denied the allegations, saying that BBC Radio 3 is far outside his challenger trading on live music and educating the public.
I will not be anywhere about classical music we hear from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important Radio 3 commitment to discover new music and new parts," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that we need to work harder to attract audiences from the previous period because the British have little knowledge about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under BBC logo criticised during a meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport committee that would go on the trail to its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the show bought by BBC talent from Dutch producer Talpa Media for the sum of around 22 million pounds.
You understand why there are often discussions about the issue because it is not original and does not distinguish itself through anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the show conducted by BBC1 - Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - to be achieved "in a specific manner."
He added that he wants the corporation "to find a chicken with golden eggs in their own backyard" next time when they launch an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the future of the new seasons of The Voice or to spend the money that is spent on licensing on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August and could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales rose by 7%.
In the past month there has been the most sluggish growth since 2000 so far.
Online sales have taken off three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phone to make purchases.
Experts agree that Black Friday-ul in November could lead to reluctance to expenses.
For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned commercial streets of Britain into ghost towns.
Experts say, however, that there are signs that online sales are shrinking, the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total amount of money spent in August was the smallest increase since 2000 until now, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are shrinking, the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we look at the level of growth in the previous years and we are going back to 2000, there has always been a trend of streamlined," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the index of IMRG sales, for the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when shoppers began to use mobile phones to make purchases.
As such, it has increased the number of people who could make online purchases and be able to do in various circumstances, such as canapea.
But now that has lingered a little, you could see a drop (of growth).
The Black Friday, imported from America, is listed as one of the reasons for a drop in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, shoppers would refrain from making purchases before the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers flocked to the computer to get their hands on their bids, which led to the collapse of several retailers.
Experts agree that Black Friday, when shoppers were beaten up on bargains, could lead to reluctance to buyers.
A study published by British Global Retail Consortium has determined that at least 1 £ 5 per £ is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently available via online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After sanctioning Bin Laden family, Muslims bury victims killed in the collapse of macaralei mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were plimbate streets by Muslims, the first funeral taking place in mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for collapse.
Health Minister said that in total, 394 people were injured in the crash of macaralei
In a stroll down the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them on the 29 victims, killed by a crane cables at a large mosque in mecca.
Dressed in white, those who are crying death joined on their way to express their condolences, until the first dead arrived at the end of final journey at Al-Moaissem cemetery.
Sad memories preserved holy place, where just a few days ago crashed a construction crane through tavanul moscheei, dropping the faithful.
The bodies were released for the funeral after the Saudi king has sanctioned the construction of the Bin Laden family for disaster, which also ended with 394 wounded.
In the streets, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them on the 29 victims, killed by a crane cables at a large mosque in mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when collapsed macaraua.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents in advance of the annual Hajj pelerinajului.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to the mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims standing still in town.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group would not have had to leave the macaralei raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi News Agency, said the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the crash.
The service in the English news agency gave no detail, but said the company's leaders have been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier during the week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of macaralei in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before Hajj pelerinajului taking place later this month.
Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse and macaralei Group representatives could not be contacted for comment.
Royal decree has blamed the group for failing to use up-to-date security measures and did not coordinate their work with the weather.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and carried out major construction projects.
The latest al-Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "turncoat," dezmoștenit family in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in conditions of strong wind and rain, with only a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, essential travel at least once in every Muslim life physically fit.
Authorities say that 158 people remain in hospital.
The authorities have decided that the relatives of victims to receive a million Saudi riali (174.000 pounds) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other injuries will receive half of that amount.
The pros and cons of credit conversion in elvetieni francs
The market has already occurred two offers of conversion in lei of credit in elvetieni francs, the main advantages being excluding currency risk and reducing rates.
The disadvantages can come over several years, when variable interest can lead to higher rates.
Transylvania Bank has just completed the process of conversion in francs credits for Volksbank, while Bancpost announced the offer of conversion to their own clienti.
According to data accumulated by analysts FinZoom Financial portal, Bancpost provides three years of fixed interest at lions, 1.5%, the highest on the market.
On the other hand, the conversion of Transylvania Bank was 83% of clientii with mortgages in francs due to second successive cuts: it has been reduced by the value of the balance of risk and management fees paid by the customer, then it has been applied yet its additional reduction of 22.5 per cent on balance in lei.
Both offers reduced rates of clienti monthly plateau equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate of 42.5 per cent, while Bancpost, with 33% in the first three years and, in theory, with 18% in the next five years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the credit crunch in lei covresiei in CHF is to remove the currency risk, the consumer is protected from future francului cresterile, and credit repayment will be made in the currency in which incaseaza salary.
Another major advantage of both the conversion offers is that there is a reassessment, does not require additional guarantees and another proof of income.
In practical terms, there will be a new look at financial and legal credit and there will be no additional costs as in the case of refinantari.
Both banks also offer a discount on the monthly rate, compared to the plateau clientii before the conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the early years is more of interest, and the client very ramburseaza in particular.
Bancpost offer with a great interest in the first three years seems to be beneficial for clienti.
There is no cunoaste but how it will evolve interest after three years.
The margin could be greater than 3.25 per cent, so the total, and the reduction of costs is still small.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest, as is the index ROBOR to increase significantly in the next five years (more than Libor index - CHF).
For example ROBOR in three months is now 1,44%, but in 2013 had reached the value of 6% in 2009 to more than 15%, and in a few days in 2008 to overcome 40%!
In addition, it is possible to guard and other costs, in the initial nementionate.
Now is the time for decisions on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The ațintește their gaze towards meeting scheduled over two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will decide whether to grow or not the interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, slightly more than half that last week thought that the decision will be taken, now I think the situation will be maintained for a while, and that interest rates will be kept in the current 0-0,25%.
This is a historic event because seven years have passed since the Fed has brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are dealing with a situation in which a major central bank could drop the rate again and to initiate a process of normalisation of interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, senior analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, bringing the trillions of dollars in stock and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Fed must not ignore the global situation less rosy.
He warned the markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 TEC.
Stars who lost their allure
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in the past few years.
In 2001 he battled leukemia and in 2009 lost his partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.

All this was certainly a cost.
Luke Shaw player from Manchester United sits on several months because of double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double jaw in the leg in a match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, which ended with a defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event, which brought tears in their eyes, and which will keep him on for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
Injuring came in the wake of a wild reaction from Héctor Moreno in minute 15, after Shaw, aged 20, broke PSV defence.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "Are dual jaw knee and is in hospital."
It will be transferred tomorrow or tomorrow will then be operated in Manchester.
It is appalling - a boy who came to Manchester United when 18, encounter difficulties, then fantastic plays and now goes something like this.
In the dressing area was put on oxygen mask.
Plângea.
I am not a doctor, but the double jaw is repausul for six months and will not play in the grupelor.
I hope to be able to play again this season.
It appears that Moreno was lucky and escaped from the red card and the concession of a penalty kicks.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal has suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for themselves when they say that it is a foul and red card.
It was a very ugly intervention, with two legs.
A message on the Twitter account of Shaw: "Thank you all for your messages, I have no words to express how I feel, start the road to recovery, I will come back stronger."
Similar news: Manchester United hit by injuring Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
Fullback England team is a further reason to catch up to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It is a very injury urată."
Everyone is very sad when a player is suffering such an injury.
Our players are never accidenteze to an adversary.
Moreno broke his leg off playing for Mexico's national team against the Dutch national team led by Van Gaal at the World Championship in 2014.
"Is very difficult because he did not intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it is a very serious injury, it is not good," Cocu said.
I have not seen the stage.
I have not been able to see the ball, heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it, but I could not see the intervention of Luke.
In a statement on SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to get through with something like that.
I feel bad foare, I am so sorry.
PSV player, Andrés Guardado, also went to hospital after an intervention on the part of Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly stuck England omission, but is still toughing it out
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but having seen the squad to tour England, do not take into account a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in Test matches.
I would not rule out the option of a victory.
Maybe the team of Alastair Cook has less experience than three years ago, but has good players on spin in the batting and collective morale is strong; there will be marked in 2012 but will have a positive attitude youthful.
Moeen Ali and spinner Adil Rashid, even if it is unknown at the level of testing, is an option for attack.
Similar issues: Adam Lyth has left England's squad for Test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as the head coach of Yorkshire, I find it difficult to look at the decision not to select him to Adam Lyth in the team.
He played seven Test matches against two good strikers, in difficult conditions, and simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no question marks over Joe Root, for example, until they have made the announcements because - and this is what I said before - the players are their selecționeri own.
Some fifty years and perhaps their Lyth run-ul would be extended, but his fate is in his hands.
I hope that if we do more for Yorkshire run-uri will have other opportunities.
Head coach England team, Trevor Bayliss, has praised the attitude even when the performance was not commensurate with his ability, and I am not surprised at this; above all, he is a man of the team.
It is hard to answer the question as long as it is seen as a batsman in Test matches.
Lyth has had seven run-uri - as well as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton had luck at home and away.
The only complaint that I didn't have was that England preferred him on Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top form - but the missed opportunity is in the past.
The team is Alex Hales, a batsman who cotez him very well.
It is a cricket player who has "factor X" and we have seen earlier in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us on a pitch Trent Bridge.
We should give it at least the same opportunity as those before him, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched for Moeen to open the mouth along with Cook, which would cause extra spinner while retaining four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a aruncător could not hit there and this cack-handed player has already shown that it is naibii.
Perhaps Moeen has not brought success in his district, Worcestershire, but was 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches for 38 first drop before getting open in 2001.
He immediately removed three centuries and has not looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as his back-up spinner, and although I had a limited contact with him, it struck me that it is a very impressive young man.
People would be able to judge his age age - with an average of 31 at the mouth and 35 of the ball - and could believe that it is punt, but there is a lot of spinneri and selecționerii opted for youth.
Many will learn from this tournament.
England has made some changes and the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a blow to the maestro.
It is one of the best players and will bring great experience, given that he played in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and ambition.
I have always believed that he was born in order to engage in international cricket-ul, either as a player or as a coach, and just as Mahela, has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the dressing area, even though I am sending messages that were sent out and before they can bring fresh air into the team.
His teammate Colly Durham, Ben Stokes odihnește matches a day, Root received a similar reprieve against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although not all agree, duo's and selecționerii does not make the programme.
And we must remember, the jobs of players depend on the results they make.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
The Brexit could win if the economy stays in until 2017
With each passing day, the renegotiation of David Cameron to keep Britain in the EU are mounting in a mess, even without the genialului Jeremy "yes or no?" Corbyn at the Labour Party or tuc on Tuesday to bring serious criticism from Europe.
Foreigners and its characters such as Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained that past - sunk in similar crises in the EU - not all - some Member States are powered by the United Kingdom for concessions and adjustments to the Treaties on which the majority do not want them.
In Brighton, at the annual meeting, tuc decided that they do not want it if it would erode social protection.
We could even call the "selfie" of Dave and George.
Prime Minister and Chancellor are attending summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local representative, then go back home and say they have won allies for reform.
It is only about me.
My friend, who wants a Britain with outward angle under the roof - "can't be left alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more obtuzi ministers and officials in some capitals have reached the point where they do not care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, German chancellor highly cautious, is an ally, but has been in office for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation to unravel, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), which were too much.
In 2017, France's president, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his strength is in decline.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain is one of the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland out of Britain - something that we do not want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to make remarks which do not help, in the style of the SNP, in the campaign for a referendum in Britain in 2017 to speed up Brexit, suggests my amicul.
"Renegotiation was" and "Britain has achieved nothing of value in renegotiating."
Europeans know their skin acaparatoare can be Fleet Street and are skeptical of the media barons oligarhică looking sceptically, because they did not participate in the referendum in 1975 inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our entry in 1973 in 2:1 ratio.
He could vaguely remember Boris Johnson, euro-oportunistul, who became famous at the beginning of the 1990s when he was corespodent to Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew their enemies.
The mix included pungași neplătitori, foreign fraudau phone and pseudo non-domi owning most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair see them pretty much the same, but he realised that when you are imprisoned in a doghouse with a nervous gorila, we must give them bananas in order to divert attention from the thought of you eat at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to the idea of a referendum on Cameron's, given that Blair has made a concession on the principle of the EU constitution abandoned, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave an exit card.
The media has not forgiven him for that.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who struck me as a friend on Monday back at Westminster - I told him not to spend more time with me - seems to be in danger from the Murdoch egg boycott of Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but we need to develop a coherent strategy for cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left it open on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn in Europe is what I would call for leniency.
He says he would like to remain in a reformed EU.
The majority of those who do not agree with "anglicismul" conservatives could agree with that.
He said that Hilary Benn "A, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when cercetașul he struggled not to recognise that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as minister of shadow on financial issues was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on TV to be unfairly Labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing their position in the cabinet.
The battle of Hilary was more attractive.
But the fight to remain "in any situation" - the expression of Benn - do not correspond to what McDonnell said, nor what JC said colleagues and lawmakers in the private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of the image that it wants Corbyn to send a note to me and raised awareness on me - messaging discipline remains important in the television era, and especially in the maelstrom of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is not fair to give Cameron a favour ticket in Europe, allowing it to take good laburiștilor support in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins believes that certainly did.
But the basic sofismul of McDonnell and Corbyin with regard to the quality of EU membership - in line with their past anti-capitalist - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among dissidents left for narcisismul small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sofismului on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant about the fact that JC will not campaign for withdrawal - diplomats will be obliged to try to understand.
Why should waste Paris or Berlin political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions from Britain when it might be worthless?
The US are already pretty disappointed about the englezilor poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cut costs, as I was reminded of the British influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with links to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the magazine's editorial team British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined The Lancet in criticising evidence used by the Department of Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE has published the benchmark last month and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."
Some researchers have questioned the robustness of data and pointed fingers at links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical magazine Lancet attacked "the extraordinarily fragile" who founded the first PHE.
Two other researchers who write in the BMJ have questioned the claims and their base "on solid ground or sand mișcător."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said it expects the PHE assertions that "current estimates indicate that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In reality, a single meeting attended by 12 people has led to the elaboration of a model of decision analysis with multiple criteria (MCDA) to summarise their views on the negative effects associated with various products containing nicotină; the results of this meeting were presented briefly in a piece of research.
McKee and Capewell and said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director has said that it had previously received funding from the British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.
It has also validated the accreditation of BAT in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting said it received funding from a producer of electronic cigarettes, but not the financing of which there are reports that we have received from the producer of cigarettes and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
It has not been provided on the basis of the arguments that have been selected panelului members, but among them are some "leading" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even says in the paper industry.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control section of the PHE.
The research group "it whitewashes convincingly" that lacks "solid evidence on the deleterious effect it has most of the products according to the criteria of the majority of," said McKee and Capewell.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell said PHE claims that "so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or nonsmokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health department of the PHE, says it has responded to the allegations in the BMJ.
He said: "electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of the two people who have smoked all their lives lose their lives because of this defect.
All the evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic cigarettes for health are comparatively minor, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information arising and those that do not arise from evidence, given particularly high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Every year, about 80000 people die because of diseases associated with smoking and the annual costs incurred by the country's health care system due to smoking up to 2 billion pounds.
Clearly expressing current evidence - namely that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not devoid of risks, they are only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - our national debt.

One of the announcements made parody of the Special Patrol Group.
According to Garvin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more questions and seeks to make political works accessible to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists converge on working with activists in protest movements, realising that they need to go out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society.

The creative director of VCCP "Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding advertising for arms fair - with an empty space in the Excel - and it was thought" shall provide them with a campaign that seeks to avoid a."

Eight golden rules to live at home
11 years have passed since I moved into the home, when I was a young man of 19 years old, who still believed in moral berete and relativitate, but just now I remember the forced zâmbetele enervam - and the numerous complaints to others.

Violinist David Grimal: in the era of Bach there were no global tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu, were people who work, artists and business representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only for the little-known Serbian singer but also as the initiator of a project less rife, downright "strange," as he says even he, Les Dissonances - an orchestra of solisti international and musicians talentati interpreteaza simfonic repertoire without having a conductor, and this is what makes him at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu festival with two performances: a play on Sunday, in which the little-known Serbian singer was David Grimal, the orchestra founder, and one on Monday, when the spotlight was the cellist Xavier Phillips, the works composed by Enescu nelipsite.
Both performances, held on the Ateneului scene, audiences showed another way to interpret music.
Les Dissonances has appeared on the musical scene in 2004, at that time, as the only classical music ensemble in which there was no conductor.
Conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand the musicians need an education to become solisti, either to become interpreti in an orchestra - speak of instrumentisti, and not by composers.
They are formati as "hard-working specializati."
They have the impression that they need a conductor.
In another part of the scene, the audience, all musical fetisizarea axeaza is the conductor.
And so, businessul, musical industry, marketing.
Therefore, no longer talking about music.
So, if you look at this world, we are on the one hand calificati workers, which is stupid, and an audience that can listen, but must priveasca, what is so stupid," David Grimal.
Violinist povesteste that change in the way the music came from "deceptiilor music" from his career of little-known Serbian singer.
As I was an athlete at a high level that we needed to do the same May exercise in the world with different orchestras, in order to gain money and to make money and music industry.
After 10 years, when I was around 30 years ago, I found it very depressing, so that no more gaseam creativity and umana fraternity in this system.
So, I have never found any sense to continue on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This is happening in 2004, and at that time nobody facea anything without a conductor: "Musical world, extremely conservative, has no such projects."
"How to Do you do marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no ego?" they ask me the artist.
David Grimal recognise that Les Dissonaces represents a "luxury," saying that none of the musicians who belong to the orchestra does not depend on the success of this project to life.
In 10 years of existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a musical piedica in the act: "Curiously, as cantam a wider repertoire, with seems so simple, so that all the musicians are obligati to be featured in the work and not only in part," sustaining Grimal, adding that the spectacle of Sunday "was 74 conductors on the scene."
In his opinion Grimal, Enescu Festival is a "very courageous," just for the guest and Les Dissonances: "A great festival, where they are present the greatest orchestras in the world who sing and 3 times a day, and in the midst of these guest orchestras and this strange group."
In a temple of traditiei orchestrale, as is the Enescu festival, and interest for something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking about the work of Enescu, violinist recognise that feels music Romanian operation of the famed Roman composer, so that there was no need for a special approach when he introduced works by Enescu in repertoire or.
Grimal noteaza Enescu music is very instinctiva, but this is what happens when we talk of George Enescu and music Romanian operation, "and there was a George Enescu music was French."
Grimal militeaza to change how they do educatia musical, as having "the profession of musician, as it is today, has a flavour of death" and that "the future of music is music itself."
We do not need to make the world five times a year if not serveste to anything.
In the era of Bach there were no global tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu, were people who worked, who were artists and trade representatives.
For me, holding concerts, festivals, tournaments, albumelor launch, all are formidable, extraordinary, but are in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system in which creativity is suffering, there is no freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Cernavoda before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before his intrati in the EU, aveati vegetables and meat."
In order to enter the EU had to adoptati sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are arriving in the supermarkets, as happens in France.
The music is happening, it is the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes red may not too nice, but when their red taiem are adevarate.
In a world ideala, it should be that his return to music in the centre and the institutions and industries that gestioneaza this system to understand that music does not need to be sold, but it needs to be impartasita, and this can be done since educativa policy.
"If we consider - like a coreenii, the Chinese, the Japanese - as western-oriented music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce his invatarea in school, we reintroduce concerts on TV and that education would no longer be required to sell musical by-products," believes Grimal.
Of course, there are things in musical educatia who remain very communist, that's everywhere, something very militarised.
It depends on the discipline comparam if a musician with a soldier, or if these a musician who will sing in an instrument, as it is, before all, musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, but if we want these to be a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want these to be a musician, it is something else.
After your parearea, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? "they ask me French artist zambind.
Grimal suggest that, for artists, reward another way of making music just comes from overcoming the status of "soldier," overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Discovering musicians at a certain time as they are not soldiers, and that is why after leaving concert zambitori."
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and about his vision of music and the artist in the "Ideilor Festival," a public debate held in the George Enescu International by Aspen Institute Romania.

Cinema City is looking for "Micile voices."
Cinema City is the most pressing challenge for children: a doubling of two characters from superproducția "Snow Crăiasa 3D"
You have a baby super-talentat and spontaneously, whom we love movies?
It gives them a chance to reach vedetă.
In September, in the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to find future stars and who were between 8 and 16 years, Cinema City is looking for "Micile Greater voices," giving them the opportunity to double two characters in a famous film animation.
If the classic offering is the emphasis on the voice actor features cartoon character, lately, the creation of the story are taken into account and those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually very popular actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices, and that is why we start a campaign like no other.
We want to find the right place and cause parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They will be part of a special experience, because the characters are simpatice and replicile are funny.
"Children will be fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of players," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.

What we need to do is parents to access micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where to enroll the child in the contest and to prepare it for the voice.
Later, we have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, to download the texts on which the child is expected to read them and then the child will be playing their own version of dublaj.
Four films about friendship, fairytale heroes, magic and hope they can choose to support competitors: "The Yellow feathers 3D," "Mune: Gardianul 3D Month," "Blinky Bill: the Koala poznaș 3D" and "Maya Albinuța 3D."

FedEx earnings are mixed, dropping fiscal forecasts for 2016.
Fedex reported disappointing results for the last quarter, in the field of giant supplies by reducing profit estimates for the full year due to lower demand for transport services and increased costs for its transport division on land.
The company also said that it plans to hire around 55.000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
During the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares have fallen by around 2.5% in pre-market trading, with 45 minutes before the opening clopoțelului Wednesday.
Fedex Corp. said it expects to earn between 10.40 dollars and 10.90 dollars for the fiscal year ending in May of next year, with 20 cents less, according to a previous estimates.
Analysts had predicted the figure of 10.84 dollars, according to a survey by FactSet.
The estimate comes despite rising prices by 4.9 per cent on average, with the entry into force on 4 January and higher suprataxele for land transport of large packages or with great difficulty, which will apply in November.
The company said it still expects earnings growth from the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and the development of e-commerce.
The president and general manager Fred Smith said "company faces an economic situation considerably weaker than expected, especially in terms of production and global trade."
Plans for employment during the holiday season were announced a day after UPS contestant said that it plans to hire additional workers 90.000-95.000, about the same number of employees as we did last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx won 692 million dollars, with 6% more than last year.
Earnings per share were 2.42 dollars, below average estimates of 2.44 dollars per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5% to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analysts who participated in the poll conducted by Zacks called for the amount of 12.23 billion dollars.
The company FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international transport, which led to the stagnation of registered revenues of its Express unit.
But the boom in online shopping has săltat the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, division ground revenues rose 29%, but operational revenues have virtually stalled due to higher costs for large packages and their own insurance.
Express unit has seen an increase in revenues due to higher commodity prices, while revenues have fallen due to rising costs.
In pre-market trading, with about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares scăzuseră with 3.85 dollars, or 2.5%, at 150,15 dollars.
Tuesday at scăzuseră closing 11% at the level of a year and 17% compared with the maximum recorded record on 11 June.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meetings in recent years, those responsible for drafting the policies of the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a table of Honduran mahon with 27 feet to decide whether the time has come to increase a key rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at the end of the session hall of the central bank, will see a mural painting in the United States.
The map is intended to recall that Janet L. Yellen, the EDF President, and his colleagues need to put the economic interests of the nation above all.
The Central Bank has received a double burden from Congress: to maximize the rate of employment in the US and to maintain price stability.
However, since the great economic crisis, the EDF leaders have confirmed that there is a third nescrisă task: financial stability.
And this third task could be X factor in a decision too difficult to predict, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is ready to be dezbărată of unprecedented stimulus provided by the interest rate on short-term almost zero in force since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data indicates a strong growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could terrify the EDF officials already cautious about adding volatility by increasing the benchmark rate for federal funds - even with a quarter of a percentage point.
"Clearly, the labour market and inflation will be the first and the main issues on which they will pursue," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the broker's firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
," However, I believe that if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, growing uncertainty on the world market is sufficient to provide arguments to wait," she said.
There is no consensus regarding the decision that it will take the EDF, which itself causing instability in the financial market.
Nearly half of economists recently polled by Bloomberg had predicted a rise in interest rates this week.
But financial markets expect the EDF to postpone an indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the EDF is increasing the interest rate, except where those who are drawing up policies that would soften the blow by promising that it would take a long time until the next boom.
On Tuesday, the industrial average Dow Jones climbed 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The boom was triggered by expectations that the EDF makers will keep interest rates stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising for the EDF to raise interest rates at this time," Lonski said.
If the EDF makers would do this, "should act in depth in their policies in order to avoid panic in the financial markets."
Other experts have said that an increase in interest rates would calm financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty of when the EDF will act.
Just over a month ago, the EDF appeared to be on track to increase the rate of % this month, the first small step towards slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the US recovery.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that expect an increase in interest rates this year despite the objections raised by liberals that would need more economic progress.
Although employment has slowed in August, the growth of the labour market has been strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and almost considered the level of the EDF as full employment of the workforce.
Wage gains have shown signs of growth.
And although inflation has continued to reach an annual target of the central bank, the EDF makers have said that a key reason was the temporary effect of oil prices in sharp decline.
The "can cope with the higher rates and needs them, given the strain on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets worldwide have begun to enter fibrilații at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
Industrial average Dow Jones has fallen 16% below peak reached record highs in May, as investors have feared that the slowing Chinese economy will drag down global growth.
The market was somewhat reculat this month, the Dow index is now about 10% below peak in May.
For the EDF makers, the market turmoil adds to the complexity of the calculation of the increase in interest rates.
"What happened in financial markets and news about the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be more decisive in meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a researcher with experience in the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and was officially the EDF.
Now, he expected to wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is great uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and that they do not have data on which to build further events in China," Oliner said.
The global economy is not one of the major interests of the EDF, so it should not be taken into account in making decisions.
But, in reality, the EDF has become monetary authority worldwide.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been huge.
Simply alluding to the then chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the EDF could "decrease" monetary expansion has triggered earthquakes on global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are becoming more twinning, it is expected that the EDF officials not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decisionmaking is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, the head of global strategy for the firm's management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President Federal Reserve Life Bank in Richmond, it will, said this month that "the EDF has a history of bloated response to changes in the financial market which seem to have no connection with economic bases."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, a body with the role of the decision, which has supported an increase in interest rates, offered for example decisions in 1998-99.
A financial crisis that hit Asia has prompted the EDF to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.75 per cent in three meetings, despite "implications with the possibility of limited identification for US development," Lacker said.
A year later, the EDF officials have returned to their respective scăderilor.
The EDF should put the issue of financial stability in the first place only in the event of a major crisis, such as the earthquake was on the market in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the committee setting interest rate from the Bank of England.
The last turbulent period is nowhere near at that level, he said.
"Certainly that we do not want to get into the situation of our fears of a rise in the interest rate because they were distressed markets," said Posen, Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Life holds a further dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something will change in this respect, I do not think we should take action prematurely.

Four people died after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a six-year-old boy aged 4, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country's new constitution, said Wednesday an official.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 kilometers west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, more than 1000 protesters gathered in front of a police precinct, and some of them threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said that police forces have used tear gas after they were fired in the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, two dozen police officers were injured and five civilians.
It was not clear immediately that rubber bullets, which they know that they can kill, but are used usually as an alternative, less lethal, have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the ethnic Madhesi says that the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute the influence policy.
Protests were also in western Nepal, where Tharus ethnic group wants their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in clashes triggered on August 10,

Surgery to reduce weight could be useful in the case of diabeticilor with mild obesity
The benefits of reducing chirurgiei weight in the case of people with mild obesity, with zaharat diabetes type 2 could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether diabeticii with mild obesity live longer after surgical intervention for weight loss than those who are nechirurgicale treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralise data on mortality," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, she wrote an article about a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Surgery for weight loss, called and bariatrică surgery, using various methods to reduce bellies.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatrică surgery has proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 zaharat diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbidă obesity, with a body mass index (IMC) 35 or higher.
IMC, a unit of measure of weight in relation to short, it is considered normal in the 18,5-24,9.
The IMC at least 25 indicates that a person is supraponderală and people with IMC over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate accessing IMC-ul: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan have used data collected in 2007 in a trial that compares two types of bariatrică surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomie manșon - medical treatment of type 2 zaharat diabetes in people with mild obesity.
IMC environment for people who have undergone surgical intervention has decreased from 31 to 24.5% to the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, the IMC to people who have received nechirurgicale treatments against zaharat diabetes has remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
Among those who have undergone surgical intervention, zaharat diabetes has been completely healed at 36% and partly at 28%.
In the group treated with medical methods, by comparison, zaharat diabetes has been completely cured in just 1% and partly to only 2% of subjects.
In addition, arteriale tension control, trigliceridele and LDL cholesterol "were generally better in surgery group," concluded the authors.
The researchers also had a sanguin level of hemoglobinei A1c, which reflects the glicemiei over time.
The researchers write that the optimum level of hemoglobinei A1c is below 7%.
After surgical intervention, the average level of hemoglobinei A1c has fallen from around 9% to about 6%.
However, in the group treated with medical methods, stood at around 8%.
But this "glicemic" improved - reflected in improved levels of hemoglobinei A1c - have not reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to senior researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team has also compared the average associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with gastrectomie manșon group with surgical intervention bypass lost more weight (18,7 14.2 kilograms), has made more substantial drops in the value of the IMC (7.4 5.1) and of hemoglobinei A1c (3.1% to 2.1%) and presented a higher probability of complete remisiune zaharat diabetes (46.9 percent from 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study on people with great weight in Sweden that surgical intervention prolongs life, says Blackstone, at Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who have undergone surgical intervention bariatrică showed a probability of around 29% lower to die after 15 years, compared with a group that has tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study has not shown a survival benefit in patients who have undergone surgical intervention, Blackstone said, is a positive aspect for people under 35 IMC interested in the procedure.
"This is where this piece is critical, because they say that surgical intervention is safe in the group with IMC," without increasing the risk of death or renală disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should begin to take seriously the patient's IMC-ul reach 27-30.
"I think we wait too long to urge people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have scurtcircuitat predispunându bodies in obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe would not be able to receive all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader has sent a call for an end to violence in the mother of refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in a speech he gave at the opening of the Dalai Lama for compassion in Oxford, dedicated to studying ethics, earlier in his trip for 10 days in Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of individual nations and even of each continent.
He also stressed that, although admirable, the response of countries in western Europe on the refugee crisis is a bad situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama has praised German and Austrian efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful for a few thousand refugees, but we must look at the same time to long-term solutions to bring genuine peace and development, especially through education, in Muslim countries," he stressed.
After all, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush after the terrorist attacks on 11 September, saying that the violent response from the US led to an uncontrollable chain of events.
After the events of 11 September, we sent our condolences in a letter to President Bush and I told him to solve this problem without having to resort to violence.
I know that his motives were strong, but he used the force and led to unintended consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingerat hands detergent in the last 4 years
According to anti-otrăvire Center in Georgia, anti-otrăvire centres in the US have reported an increase of nearly 400% since 2010 in terms of the number of children under 12 years of age who have swallowed up detergent hands with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Centre in Georgia anti-otrăvire, cases of ingerare detergentului hands in children under 12 years of age reported at anti-otrăvire centres have climbed from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children have more access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them end up in the emergency room," said Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some children deliberately drink detergent and others do in order to impress friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
YouTube videos can be watched showing them as teenagers drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that teenagers are mixed with water detergentul mouth with alcohol to get a drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the smell of detergentului.
"A child thinks that makes them evil,," says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (hands detergent) are the designer clothed.
Hands detergents with garlicky flavour of strawberries, strugure, portocală are the most attractive for children.
Detergentul contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in small children, only a few înghițituri can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the centre of the anti-otrăvire University Hospital in Kansas, for the Fox 4 in Kansas City.
Thus, avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these detergents in accessible places and if the lower reaches them, it is a quick way to consume much alcohol.

Why are witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Later today, except for a belated legal intervention, I will watch it sentenced a man to death.
If it happens, and I hope that does not happen, I will sit in a room for observers in the execution of Penitenciarului Oklahoma State, and I will see how Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four witnesses to his death.
The invitation came the first time in January, through his best friend, and, although I was shocked, I accepted.
Nears its day, I purport the idea.
So, what to do?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can be witnessed executions in America, and because it usually demands exceed the number of available seats, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
Those elected will look with impartiality.
I cannot do that.
I would sit next to closest friends of Richard Glossip, moreover I have developed my own connection with him over the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two hours.
I love the type.
Often laugh at when talking.
Prison authorities say that they cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will be allowed to have a carnețel and a pix for me to write down what I see.
We will have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma has accused me on Twitter that compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story about the detainee as he wants to gain access.
I have complained about it.
He acknowledged that "could make better," but it still feels wrong.
Richard Glossip did not agree with some of the things we said and I wrote them.
I do not know what to write, and I would not do it even if I would ask.
I told him that I can remove from the list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants to be an international report to write about this topic.
Believes that, if it dies, it will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for The Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to a series of multimedia files that have been made.
I will not go back over all details here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese made him guilty of complicity.
But I think it is very likely not to be guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think that his execution is wrong.
And I will be dying from this perspective.
I cannot pretend that I am totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
To me you will find out how it is to watch a man whom I love dying unnecessarily.
Peter Moody claims that stewarzii tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw from race
Peter Moody said stewarzii Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy on its grajdurile last year and has threatened to immediately withdraw from the race.
It has launched an attack against stewarzilor and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they ran a personal campaign against him, the straw that broke the camel's back was the removal of the Lady Tatai race due to a treatment administered on race day.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the races, and that is placed in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome of the test for cobalt to Lidari, for which there is no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed up the words on his statements about spies and did not want to resemble "sly which do not reach the grapes."
"Was not going to say anything about the issue, and I have remained silent for a long time, but sometimes reach a level of frustration is so high that it răbufnește suddenly," Moody said.
It is known that has continued.
Sometimes react and must bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have said.
Tonight I will go home and I will sleep soundly.
I want to go with the chin up, and I wish the owners with which I am working to see that I strive to provide them with everything that is better.
From the moment they begin to believe that this is not what happens, we need to give up the job of trainer.
At that time should be thinking about what I will do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody threw the bomb in an interview given to racing.com who said that the integrity department has tried to spy on them grajdurile.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whose name I will say if I asked - and offered to hire him to my grajdurile to provide information about the work there," Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously, I consider it a trișor.
If so, then we should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, the current chairman of RVL and Bernard Saundry, Executive Director of the RVL current CEO, knew at the time, and I know today.
Should I think that is something personal?
It is necessary for RVL to begin to have backbone and can hold accountable people outside trainerilor for what is happening in the industry?
I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe that's how I see the other.
Perhaps we need to take my license and I have to step aside, and I have no doubts that the statements they make now could lead to think about this option.
I arrived, but at the point where I no longer care and that I am sad.
I am greatly saddened.
I will put pressure on and I will get them to take a decision.
My family supports me, and I can go.
Trainerului frustration grew with long investigation into the cobalt testing involving Lidari and removal led to assert that could "to put their license on table."
Moody, whose name is most often associated with driving campionului undefeated Black Caviar, has labelled the rule of the day of the race as "ridiculous" after it was applied to the feet of horses a stopgap with mud or argilă, which violates the rules.
Breaking the rules.
We need to make full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees has put him in the mud on foot.
It could have happened only last night.
It could have happened yesterday, what has happened.
It happened on the day of the races.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment in the event consisting of cataplasmei application, for which stewarzii opened an investigation.
It is a joke.
People who make these rules do not know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who struck and fled the scene in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist produced in Cobram at the weekend and followed by fleeing from the scene.

Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy, responding to the allegations of wrestling.
Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy, called the criticism on the tactics of placare used by his team as "skewed toward" raised by the two main favourite in the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson, said that the referees have allowed players to "to take it to grips" team won the match nervous in the final qualifying match on Friday evening in Sydney.
The coach of the Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, has made a slight reference to after his team's victory in the qualifying match against North Queensland cowboys, played on Saturday evening, when he called the match a "demonstration of" rugby league and said that the two teams from Queensland are too in wrestling.
Bellamy jumped on the tactics in defence of placare addressed his team and said the players were focusing simply on "contact" when placau.
Bellamy says he has gained confidence after two senior coaches criticised the team, meaning that they were worried that will defeat them.
"And things do not stop there - I have not heard Trent Robinson complaining about wrestling when they beat us with the 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so that in the last six weeks we have really focused on contact in placări and so we have changed the situation.
Trent is in office for three years and obviously has a wonderful team, so that probably is not accustomed to losing, and it was a shock to him.
Nostim as always happens in this time of year.
Bellamy has contradicted the idea of Bennett "anima football," recalling his mentorului St George-Illawarra Dragons Bennett won the championship in 2010 by playing football" boring."
Wayne is talking about suspenseful football.
He argued the comparându game Saturday evening with our game on Friday evening and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that, in 2010, St George has received much criticism because it was a boring team and Wayne said he is not interested in either black under unghie.
But now has a team that can play what we see as exciting football, especially thanks to mijlocașilor young quick.
This kind of game you want to do it when you have such players.
He made this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two Ivorian like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play that way.
For me, it gives me more confidence because they say these things because I am somewhat concerned about the match with us.
Six weeks ago you probably are not thinking of us when they are thinking of important matches.
Bellamy has also pointed out that the match between the Roosters was stiffer competition compared to the match between the Broncos and cowboys.
The game from the Broncos was probably a good game, I have not seen him yet, but the score was? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two attempts, the mean suspenseful game?
Or suspenseful means to make breaks and not to marchezi?
For me there are plans.
If I talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet.
Is this trade last week because they have earned the right to play at home or with North Queensland cowboys, or with the Cronulla Sharks in preliminariilor final next Saturday at AAMI Park, putting tickets on sale starting next Tuesday morning.

FriendsFest: the series of comedy that has taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar personajelor series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the peak of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicidul was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in Britain, and is three times more common in men than in women.
In a bid to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against miserable life (Campaign Living Miserably (calm)) has designated 2015 as the Year Bărbatului, wanting to question culture that prevents men to ask for help when they need.
Friendship lies at the heart of the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted on more than 2000 high school students who showed symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by many friends "with a healthy state of," its chances of recovering doubles.
Similarly, for those who are not deprimate, a circle of mentally healthy friends halving the likelihood of emergence of mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to take effect, it first must be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is on style and not substance, immediately the response often comes before contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create looks for a strong personality, open for fun and success, even though in reality the isolation is the one that dominates.
This success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinseci values; money, image, social status, all with the intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which even more deeply affects our mental health.
Billionaire inventor of an aul video game recently explained that the money does not buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that he had looked on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the workplace but their own personality, which looked through interacting as friends.
Îmbrățișărilor frequent humor of Joey and Chandler, when watching football in the cosy seats and his passion for Rachel Ross came from the fact that it is known that men can be associated with this situation, even though they often are willing to explore their feelings.
As I explained to a social worker:... "my job to listen to people with suicidal tendency and deprimate showed how even the smallest interactions" with friends can make a difference.
Often, people who come to us do not feel able to speak with friends.
The old adage descurci alone is strong, as the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that I have come to mind when I try to offer more psychological mechanisms for adaptation in the long term.
The show has singled out the small moments of friendship between men.
No matter how much it helps objective, outside intervention, phone-based, people in times of desperation, long-term support comes from the family and close friends.
So, if you participate in this last week at FriendsFest held by Comedy Central, complete with restoring the platourilor video to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends at a coffee at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone in Starbucks, smiling at me and you welcome.
You never know what difference could make your friendship.
Friends airs on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - at #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG to set aside Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates along with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he scored against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored in the match on Tuesday his debut in the Champions League and helped PSG to assert itself in the Swedish team Malmo.
Still you get cronica game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have done their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting a series of groups matches Champions League, with a reassuring victory 2-0 against Malmo in a match played on Tuesday in the Park des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes to start his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing French champions the advantage although they missed a number of occasions before to secure an advantage with the goal he scored 61 Cavani in the minute.
In Group A along with Real Madrid and Șahtior Donețk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the French team is not only qualification in the next round but also an improvement in the journey towards quarterfinal in each of the last three tournaments.
But, although they have taken the points, students Laurent Blanc was far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who has squandered the opportunity gap after which was replaced by the team from his hometown and club at which he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"Is not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so the victory 2-0 creates problems our opponents and sets a comfortable margin over the next ranked, even if there is something that we must improve throughout the season," said Blanc.
It is a good sign.
We wanted to win, and I did it, although I am sorry that I have not been able to give one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after injuring at one of three changes to the team in Paris, with a remiză 2-2 at home to Bordeaux in League 1 at the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight at the minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who will lead PSG at the next level in Europe and has demonstrated this when țâșnit shift of Marco Verratti behind his defence before Malmo incredible over Johan Wiland, in the long run from the right gate.
But if you expect PSG to win pocnind victory in their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-off to arrive at this stage and entered the field with nine holders of national teams, with a defence of five men and two Ivorian defensivi, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, the exception a set-piece from Nikola Djurdjic who went to the post of Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players have slowed several times, giving a few unnecessary passes and nefinalizând interventions, even Ibrahimovic who has missed no less than five attempts in the first half and was then replaced by Cavani even after the resumption of the game.
Ibrahimovic has proved much more skillful in supporting his colleagues, his shift was the Di Maria sent in a shot diverted by Wiland over 52 in the minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after an hour of the match, thanks to Cavani, uruguayanul who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from his centrarea Maxwell.
This gap has eliminated the hope from Malmo to reechilibra score and only a superb stop of Wiland distance for rejecting David Luiz has kept the final score before new intratului Ezequiel Lavezzi to cancel a goal in stoppage time.
Norwegian coach of the team from Malmo, Age Hareide, said afterwards that PSG were a class above and that "The last game we played in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, I have only played professionally in Sweden, which is not up to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Hats off to PSG.
They have made an excellent game.

"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost self-restraint, and through its irationale tribunal, jigneste Ungarie," said Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs in a statement.
Civilizati European politicians say no such uncontrolled slander.
"His remarks have only one explanation: lost total support in domestic politics in Romania," said Hungarian foreign policy chief, according to MTI.
In a posting Tuesday night on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said wants stern warning and his sanctioneze behaviour of senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "is a rusine for culture and values of the European Union."
I do not want to raspund the challenges coming from the Hungarian government.

Romanian Prime Minister said that he is a believer in some ways rationale and sustainable in the case of the refugee crisis, acknowledging that brutalitatile and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Ghimpata sarma, aggressive laws, inchisori and brutality of course will not solve the problem - only to suggest that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, are decidenti policies with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya and other countries are fleeing from the refugees!
"I believe in solidarity, in ways rationale and sustainable, and especially in the superiority of European values - what we are seeing in recent days in Hungary is in complete contradiction with these goals and values!," stressed the head of the executive.
Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, described as "mere lies" remarks by Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta on the management of the refugee crisis, acknowledging that those statements are inappropriate for a leader in the 21st century, according to MTI.
The Hungarian foreign policy cited Tuesday as "extremist remarks and false," the Romanian prime minister of the tin domestic policy in Romania and has made it clear that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto was referring to a statement issued Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I said and I always say is that I am xenophobic rhetoric against his idea inchidem borders, for all those who are terrorists, they are rubbish from the Middle Ages and I oppose this approach.
If we can get to many, receive it, the problem is our logistics capacity to treat those people as people, not as he takes aim at nostri Hungarian neighbours, to be and with inseriatul.
"This is what I do not agree," said the chief executive, briefing the media at Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government in Budapest has decided to begin preparations for the land border with Romania to fence Seeking on the border with Serbia, in order to deal with a possible change to the route used by migranti.

How has inchis Haghi contestatarilor mouth
Considered the world's largest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labelled, after withdrawing from work, as a weak coach, which may not be able to achieve effective and in the new posture.
After experiente unhappy at national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, after a year, the role of coach at the Future of Constanta, the team on which a patroneaza.
Fixed after a year of taking office, he has shown that it is able to transform a team to save zbatea from relegation offence.
So, after a year of days, the Future, with coach Hagi, 16 victories, 11 remize and infrangeri 11.
Bilantul is one of the top teams knocking on European cups.
Things took a turn and better for the Future in this season, as the team finished second in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the Astra Giurgiu.
The future and is the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (on par with Astra), more than double than Star.
On the other hand, even though the team has brought many players experimentati, Hagi has continued its policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the starting lineup occurred names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club has moved from a Future team to watch as well as teams from abroad, such as Hagi sold in this summer of 1.5 million euros - Ianis Haghi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexander Mitrita (Bari - 500000 euros).
Along with the Star, Future is the only profitabila team in League 1, according to data from the Register;.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.
It's a legitimise strategy, but afterwards you cannot ask him to be treated as saptea country in the EU.
Large countries come up with solutions for the EU, said Cristian Ghinea, a member of the College of the Director of the Centre for European Policy.
In an interview com economic, Cristian Ghinea said that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the police will not continue operating in this crisis: "May have doubts over the quality of values with which these people."
But there are masses that have been started and we cannot return history.
Migration is a reality in which we must adaptam as well and adaptam them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Ghinea, we were in an extremely emotional moment, in which politicians feel the need to show their muschii.
After he passes, Europeans will not be his dispusi step to free circulatie, but use the Schengen rules should be changed: "There is now an animal created in another era, and that was not adapted to the situation now."
Where we are in the refugee crisis after the JHA council which, in fact, nothing has changed?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All the forecast for saying that it would have had the necessary votes.
Prior to the Lisbon Treaty, the JHA apply the principle of unanimitatii and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very integrated in the fields of justice and internal affairs.
After Lisbon, apply normal procedure, in which the EC is taking the initiative, and the board approved a vote of 55% of member states, i.e. 16, which represent 65% of the EU population.
The calculations were saying that the votes were there.
But they did not want to go ahead.
For it is a sensitive issue, even rejection reactii occurred in Germany against the policy of openness to Chancellor Merkel and did not want as many countries as a reaction to "send us migranti per."
They have therefore postponed final, but the problem remains that, obviously, this wave creeaza a key issue for guvernanta Schengen and will likely see the big changes there in the next period.
So binding quotas were not really removed, but the subject was only allowed to be more raceasca?
Yes, on the other hand, it speaks about the greater involvement of Frontex in managing external borders, meaning a shift from individuala responsibility to members who are at the external borders of Schengen at the Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey and is Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migranti has given the limits of the Schengen system.
Perhaps it will be in Dublin, according to migrantii that are the responsibility of the state in which the first time, for it is not sustainable.
If Greece capoteaza, you cannot say that is infinitely Greece's job.
The problem is common.
Just as the problem is, a solution is possible without a precise mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, partition of reception?
No one knows exactly how they will continue operating mandatory quotas, whether it will reach them.
So the question remains: what are you doing with a man who does not want to blame in Romania or in Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I do not believe that it will hit European countries to take up migrantii: you go to country X or Y.
Expected to reach single screening centres in Greece or in Turkey, where his work on asylum applications.
It works in the ways of this kind.
But the problem is not a simple answer.
There are countries that have dozens of years of experience to try to integrate migranti, there are countries without any experience, such as Romania, where the migrantilor will increase the hate.
What is clear is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who is in poor camps and who barely started to go to Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% have got to go, it is hard for the past winter in the Mediterranean, but are next year in a wave can be even higher.
What do we do with these people?
My pronosticul is that we will be obisnui with this issue, we will no longer look so catastrophic in the eyes of the media.
Vorbeati countries with more experience or more.
It seems that there is no place where it was really the integration of large groups coming from a extraeuropeana culture?
I look at Magrebieni in France, Turks in Germany, they are all enclavizati.
I would not go towards radical statements.
Sure that their integration is more difficult than in the case of other migratie waves, but this does not mean that it is not at all integreaza.
Some neintegrata creeaza major social problems in France, in Germany, in Britain.
But it means politiensti will not continue operating.
Fortress Europe is illusory.
We have fiddled with the mechanisms of integration into European societies.
There were greseli.
We need to be more pretentiosi.
To ask these people to learn the language, try to take over its values, its no longer stay with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family including convenienta weddings.
We have separata impending problem of these people to the long-term problem of their integration.
If others failed in long-term integration does not mean that we need to look at them as ineaca in the Mediterranean.
That may have doubts over the quality of values with which these people.
And if there will be an intervention in Syria, which I do not believe, does not mean that it will recover overnight and one back.
His solution, see bulwark within Europe.
There were inchis national borders, walls, reintroduce border controls at Schengen use.
It is the European project in jeopardy?
The European project itself does not use the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built fairly minimal and aranjand rules so that the pressure was too great for the countries in which they set foot for the first time this migranti.
- New free circulam there and there, but it is one of the problems.
In the face of such a wave may not be, as some countries do not.
When there were also waves of emotie, politicians will show that they are doing something, but in the long term it does not change much.
After the bombings in France we have no more antiterorista draconica in the EU than we had last year.
It is a wave of public emotiei which is instaleaza in both directions.
And it's so instabila from one week to another that you cannot make decisions based on them.
We have vorbarie, many statements from politicians to home aflati under pressure to be virili.
And, then, the dramatic case of inecat child in Turkey and public opinion is emotioneaza.
After going public emotia, we return to the reasons why we created this use, this freedom of movement which is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the only real market.
And I do not believe that Europeans will backs the principle of libertatatii movement.
The other rules will be different.
There is now an animal created in another era, and that was not adapted to the situation now.
How Romania has played so far in this crisis?
As a small country, who believes that, if they hold sapca eyes and plug their ears, disappears.
The girl waves realitatii migranti, one chooses to be part of the solution or package that is not your problem for the small country.
We have done this, it's a legitimise strategy, but afterwards you cannot ask to be treated as the saptea country of the EU.
No esti, not playing at the level of a great country.
Large countries have come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, not just talk about their quality.
As Poland has done.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that romanilor ' appetite for Schengen will decline very much.
President Iohannis says that it is good that we have not already gone.
So we move from intrarii despair to a more pragmatic stance, but it remains the goal.
Of course there is a risk if Romania and Bulgaria to enter the Schengen migrantii to see us as an alternative route.
What does not mean that there is a reason to do any more in Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, Schengen there will be, but in the sense in which external borders will become a joint responsibility, will be unique rules of acceptance of migrantilor, single deportation rules for those who do not receive asylum, unified rules for countries that are considered safe.
Ukrainian president said that after Russia has moved from Syria to Ukraine has never killed anyone.
There is a connection between the two sites, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrata power.
She believes that to be mean to incurci Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military effort and the Putin regime, likely the Assad regime would have crumbled long ago.
And it was nice to be prabuseasca before the principal or his opponent or Islamic State.
Any two years has been a struggle between the Assad regime and militiile secular and moderate Muslim countries strenuous Gulf and Western.
Then there was the Islamic State, and now I do not know if we want the Assad regime to his manner.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but may not participate in the solution.
She creeaza outbreaks of instability and chaos that cannot be shut.
But esti great power only if the solution.
The off-side game is just a strategy to gain time.
Likely that Putin is expected to make bids, he press butoane to resolve the situation.
The offers do not come for the world is not convinced that he can solve it in one way or another issue created by him.
But I disagree with theories which say that these people are manati invizibila.
His eyes are stronger than Putin is.
What a button
Millions of users of Facebook have been rife with "Like" button, and now representatives of the social network pregatesc opposed, the "dislike."
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, a co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account, or that the button will be available soon, New York Times reports on the blog.
Zuckerberg said the "dislike" button will show rather a nuanta what feels a user than a mere optiune.
However, the announcement has raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly.
Zuckerberg cited wants to avoid when someone on the account posteaza or an important event in life, and someone else will "dislike."
Network users, which reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have been long-time to take the opportunity to express their negative emotiile or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg has said that it is not very comfortable for people to be "Like" of current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a death of a member of the family.
"Can you do not feel comfortable giving him that Like postari," the envoy noted Facebook.
A new Facebook button has not been placed well for everyone.
"There was already destula hatred on Facebook and on ordinary social networking sites," commented Atiq Haneef in Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where this article was posted on this topic.
"I will give you 'dislike' butonului 'dislike'," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiolog in Atlanta, claimed that there is nothing in an irregularity with this button, encouraging people to take different views on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, media analyst at eMarketer, noted that it is hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotii.
Moreover, she claims, the approaching election campaign in America, and the "dislike" button would create a total disaster.

Hungary on Tuesday took only 70 migranti, a thousand fighters in the table on its southern border with Serbia, said government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary declared a state of emergency earlier in the day in second judete along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, inchizand a main crossing point and announcing that it would build a fence on its border with Romania, aminteste DPA.
Drew the sudden reaction from Serbia.
Yesterday they said that they would seal boundaries for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to claim asylum.
"As what do you see, this is totally different," said Serbian Minister for refugees, Aleksandar Vulin.
Before imposing the new law on imigratia, a numar-record 5.809 migranti entered in Hungary on Sunday, said police on Monday.
Also, more than 170000 imigranti in the Middle East and Africa were patruns in Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
To avoid being registered and tries to push in the West, especially in Germany.
"The new" office of the County Council is to pice.
Two builders, in insolvency
Massive investments made here in recent years, with a view to changing the institution, is to remove it because they have been stopped several times.
Two prominent builders who worked here went into insolvency during work.
County Council headquarters in Vasile Alecsandri Street will come to remove himself.
In a year and a half when we have completed the work of strengthening and building refuncționalizare, the works have not even reached half.

CJ decision to break direct negotiations has been challenged in court by Romcatel Impex.
The ieșean sent a complaint to the CNSC, which was dismissed as belated.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another draftsman.
Romcatel Impex has the opportunity to attack the CNSC at the Court of Appeal, only after a final ruling could take into account another finding draftsman.
Thus, the consolidation of the building could resume as early next year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, the technical recovery should not take much, but we need to arrive at the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see whether the CNSC will be attacked or not," said Timofciuc.
The former headquarters of Chesturii Police began in 2011.
The first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after efectuaseră works of 4.5 million lei.

Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of President FRH, Alexander Dedu, Romania can host a major handbalistică competition only in 2024, and the women's handball team to qualify for the Olympic Games will cost a fortune.
The Romanian Handball Federation, Alexander Dedu, said yesterday, during a meeting with the media, that is a great pride that our country has three teams in groups Champions League.
In terms of national women's handball team of Romania, "the main goal is qualification for the Olympic Games in Rio, but it must go through two stages of furci between the lifts, primarily the World Championship and secondly pre-qualification tournament," said Dedu.
We very much want to qualify for the Olympic Games.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical stafului led by Tomas Ryde.
Staf, which will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a coach second, a doctor, two masori portari trainer, physically preparator, head of delegation.
We have asked for some qualifications to get things exactly material for physical training, which I have never heard.
It all to arrive at the Olympic Games. And I will do everything it takes for me to take them.
We are talking about a massive investment, there are many, many money.
But this is the way to do so.
Because at the moment we are in the stone age with preparation.
"The teams that we do have these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who noted that trying to get the money needed to purchase these products from plan and COSR.
FRH president has referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
There is no room in Bucharest.
It is a matter of infrastructure, and it is shameful to be questioned in a European Championship gym.
Let us not forget that in other parts of the world Olympic neighbourhoods were built entirely in a span of two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona was a dump, and has now reached a milestone of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the organisation of the 2012 Olympics has been a success and in terms of its investments.
"In my view, in 2024 we can host a major competition," said Dedu.
He added that international handball players are willing to give Romania a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions in Romania.
Mr. Gațu went on a project, people have given their agreement in principle, but it has become clear very quickly that it will never build the room.
And I have had discussions with EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organise and they say that I agree and to invite them in the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then discuss in detail.
"So we all open, and the EHF and the IHF, but we have no infrastructure," the official explained FRH.
Former handball player has avoided to assess the chances for women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be reserved in their forecasts, that if they do not turn against them."

After traita neither I nor my wife no longer want to calcam vreodata in your city.
No, they were hit by erroneous information in leaflets, nesimțirea rapt controllers, and bonus, a fine, "they say the law."
The spouses arrived in Iassy a few days ago, were cazat at a hotel in Centre and asked tourist leaflets.
They have also received a leaflet in which the RATP trails were overlooked.
"Armed" with these maps, wives visited Iașul.
But, two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to reach the Palas Mall.
Because it was not hold with tickets at station near Copou Park, they were based on the information printed on the leaflet: they can take ticket via SMS.
No one has said that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the leaflet, they climbed into a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions of the leaflet.
Unfortunately for them, their appearance was a team of RATP controllers.
They said that there was no longer service for 2 years and that has been announced in the press that has been cancelled.
I de UNDE STIU SA, which has been written in local media, I came up with an evening visit to the city?
I have spoken with controllers, I explained the situation, as they did not lay them, it's not their job.
The attitude was very sfidatoare.
They say that what they can do is to make deie only a fine instead of 2 (me and wife).
"I pay, I did not want to break up I visited booth at the gendarmerie and giving there!," says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family has been amended due to erroneous information on the leaflet and controllers who "have applied the law to the blood."
It is not fair, and I made a complaint to RATP Iasi to get my money.
It is not about money, I am not exaggerating, but the idea is that I have also been fleecing them for.
Unlucky for rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in custody
The trial of the seven rapists in Vaslui moved yesterday, at the Court of Appeal Ia?i.
Ieșeni magistrates have prosecuted the first trial in a nepublică session in which seven young men accused of batjocorit a young of 18 years have asked to be placed at large.
Before the actual start of the trial, one of the judges ieșeni whom the case was assigned, Viorel Munteanu, has made a request for abstinence, which was accepted by his colleagues on the court.
Magistrate served until later this year at the Vaslui, where the president was Section pe­nale, he was the one who, on 9 April, acknowledged a lawsuit brought by four of the defendants, with their placing under house arrest.
Currently, the file is judged by a completely including the Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, the file has formulated an abstention and Judge Dan An­ton, on grounds that his daughter is in a relationship with one of the rapists lawyers.
The two judges ruled that rapists from Vaslui to remain in custody.
Ti­nerii will remain in jail for at least another 30 days, when they jude­cătorii re-discuss the possibility of their release.
Urmă­torul trial will be held at the Court of Appeal Ia?i on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal Ia?i, duba with which they were transported in Vaslui rapists was involved in an accident in the Păcurari, entering the car in Iasi belt.
Iveco autoutilitara with which the seven rapists were transported to hit a car that Volks­wagen ieșise stradela Canta, while the driver tried to vireze on the left.

The car entered in Iassy here because employees General Board of Penitentiaries Administration chose the route from Vaslui to Iasi at Grajduri, then on the round-road.
They shortened the way with a few kilometres.

In order to pass on the other, the guards surrounded the back side of mași­nilor, while arestații came out in speed, two by two.
"The incident was not reported Police, because the do­uă car drivers were gentle on the damage that must be paid," said Chief Commissioner Mădălin Țăranu, within the framework of the IPJ.
Large migrations
Romania is not, nor will it be ready for what will follow.
But Europe?
I say this at the outset, loud and clear: those 7000 refugees who should and need to naturalise them is, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge in comparison with Romanian state capacity to manage such a project.
For Romania, even voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of around 1500 victims, far outweighs the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will even accept to settle in our towns, the chances of integrating them quickly in Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
I am convinced that they will be the first to lose their patience.
Parazitat mobsters and paralysed by a political class venală, the Romanian state is impotent in all areas.
Failure to integrate the Roma is just a trivial example.
Besides, the governments of any colour would not have been able to absorb European funds, to make roads, modern nurseries or schools, to ensure a decent healthcare, to collect mess on the street, to create jobs paid honour or to keep their own young generation at home.
Why would they establish refugees in another country in which they are fleeing?
But what makes a great wonder in particular is the hypocrisy that is treated in such a crisis.
Then we are first fățărnicia belicoasă strong states of the EU, which demonstrates the utmost generosity when it comes to share troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fricoasă of Romanians who, although they have relatives scattered everywhere, do not accept him yet on the other - in another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably afraid not to steal careva national life.
In the end, and there is a hypocrisy of many migrants, which, although only invoke war horrors as the reason for the departure, it does not accept any other destination in the brain than Germany or Nordic countries.
However, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan it is not war.
Also, the simplistic manner in which it is considered a crisis can only be mocked.
We have eliminated the causes, some argue, and playing strictly on the political correctness, are calling for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania it is peace, and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians to leave their country every year.
Why do they leave?
In this crisis, the European Union has been revealed as a anchilozată building, torn and broken.
Deplângeam that Romania is not able to invent a draft country, but here is that the EU does not have any plan for the future.
And improvizațiile and threats do not help anything.
Then, what is more, if the only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - the right to free movement - could be called into question due to waves of refugees who cross borders for cheese?
At one point, the war in Syria ends.
And not the crisis of migrants, however.
In the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia, and especially in Africa, for a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not nor will ever be pregatită for what will follow.

Two of Tomești frățiori have swallowed up somnifere.
They have been taken to hospital
Two children of 9 years and 11 years in Tomești, brothers, have swallowed up more than Diazepam pills.
They found pills at home and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was a treatment, and medicines were not hidden.
The children were taken to the hospital "Saint Maria" in Ia?i.
They are in stable condition, as they say doctors.
Exclusive: a meeting that breaks your heart.
In 20 years was a courageous: biological parents
Lost in hospital in unclear circumstances, in the dark during the 1990s, when only two months of life, small, bolnăvioară and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same year in which the adoption was loosely regulated, a young ieșeancă, now a Bride and beautiful girl, has reunited the other day in Iasi with biological parents in a village County, after nearly two decades in which no one knew anything else.
Crina will mark these days 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to give their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, in Iasi, in order to know the past unclear.
"The Iasi," which has witnessed efforts to search the family home after a few extremely vague clues, was a witness at these meetings, which basically cut your heart.
Reporters, emotion moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are downright moving and awesome.
The story begins Crinei 20 years ago in the village of ieșeană Ruginoasa, when only two months.
Then, due to health problems, the girl had to be internată in hospital in the city.
Home began to misunderstandings between parents, and his mother had to părărească homes.
He decided to keep the girl, and for me to send me home.
The girl stopped, and then I never knew anything.
"When I heard that he was in hospital, it was too late," remembers îndurerată Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was internată along with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pașcani, and then the girl's father, Costică Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, the Teleorman County.
Their lives were to break forever.
They never found her in the hospital Crina
After internare, Crinei father went to work in another city, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Ia?i, and father, when he returned, he never found it.
I think trecuseră nearly nine months when the girl was in hospital.
"We have thought it is abandoned," says a nepoată family.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother was unable to come up with Crina in Ia?i, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one was more interested in the fate of the child in all this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection Ia?i, who then gave it to the care of Bucium Plasament.
There were years in which abandonment and adoption were more easily dealt with today in Romania.
The Bucium was found by Italy's Salvadore and his wife, a couple of Palermo who wanted to have their child but has not managed.
They were in love with the place of Crina blonduța, and after some time it will have to move permanently with them in Italy.
The small had already done almost two years ago, as long as it took the adoption formalities.
When I saw the Crina, I felt like it was our girl.
"If my wife would have given their lives," says smiling Salvadore, adoptive parent father, while gains in the palm of the girl's unsubstantial hands.
At home, parents Crinei, Alina and Costică, continued separate searches, each where he could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no response could be his child.
Police then told that it is possible to be deceased, but the Ia?i parents have learned what really happened with their girl.
When I come here, they told me that it's plecată in Italy, to Palermo.
And looking for a no longer had.
We asked God to be good.
I thought about it in all the years that have passed, but have not been able to umblăm, to find it.
"It's hard," tells us with tears in the eyes of Crinei biological mother.
But, even if they have the past, parents of Ruginoasa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife have explained where the girl's comes and that her past links with Romania.
When I was little I learned.
I think we had five or six years.
I reacted as a copilă, I was curious.
"I wanted to know my parents in Romania," confesses delighted Crina.
And her dream was to become a reality.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romică Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Disease Prevention and Drug Enforcement Advisory Ia?i, was contacted by an acquaintance in Italy, which he explained to his Salvadore desire to find biological family Crinei.
And the search only started at a name.
After the call that we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
Primisem Balcan Costică, just a name, then the Ruginoasa.
Shortly after I had a job with the city hall there, and I could ask if there are given names.
Then they gave me some indication, only that the person found was not sought.
"It took about a month until the end of the day to find him on the girl's biological father," explains Chief Commissioner Romică Ichim.
In total, more than three months have been taken by the authorities to hunt down Costică and Alina, especially that each had domiciled in another city.
We have commenced work somewhere in March, and in the coming months we iunie-iulie completed to identify the biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that in September to hold a first meeting," added Romică Ichim.
At the weekend, Alina and Costică have seen their first lost the girl up and down the hospital in Iasi, 20 years ago.
His father, excited, barely able to contain their tears, and her hands constantly tremurau.
Change is only a few words with those around you.
A week before the meeting hardly able to sleep.
It was all excited, tremura.
"To find your child after so many years, it is something," says a nepoată, and she Costică Ruginoasa.
A meeting with his mother and brother Crinei
In talks with his girl, who is expected to study at a university ranked well in Italy, Costică Balcan said, among other things, that if one wants to return to him, in the village, to be quiet: I can give some sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and to put together a household.
It is my mother and her emotion, weep, and I find it hard to believe that something like this can happen to them.
I am very emotion.
I have never thought that something like this can happen.
I saw it on TV, I thought all these years, I had hoped, but I thought I could be myself.
There are very high emotions.
If I could forgive.
I hope to visit us in the future.
"I hope we can keep a legatură," says with big tears on obraji Alina, Crinei mother, while holding tightly in one hand șervețel.
He is still hiding tears of happiness, because soon it will be seen with her after so much bitter.
On the other side, Crina, which will be more than just a few days, this month, 20 years ago, trying to calm down as an emotional child.
I do not know what to expect, but she sketched a vague idea about her biological parents.
He believes that they are young, but now they are trying to gather their thoughts, because it has a lot to say, but nothing reproșat.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are ultimately the ones who have raised me.
It will be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a nice memory with them, because there are now so many things to say," confesses Crina.
The first family reunion in Ia?i
In Unirii Square, in the beginning of autumn, the family of Ruginoasa again unites the destiny of their girl in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years ago, finish high school, after school the Italian model, but it can begin a new chapter with Alina and Costică, her biological parents.
It is no longer separate borders or countries, but only a barrier: the language.
More than that, with the help of an interpreter, an Italian owner of the local Iașului, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make it possible to say that this is the first event of this kind, and that, in future, if they still have the opportunity to do more.
This is the first event of this kind, also an emotion, and I am glad to be a success.
We, at the Centre, have different activities, and often are associated as an institution which deals only with the consumer, people dependent on drugs.
But we are trying to bring something good back societații.
"If I had asked for such a evenimeniment, I really love to do," says smiling Romică Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Disease Prevention, Drug Enforcement Review and Advisory Ia?i.
Behind him, the Balcan, Crina middle distance recounting.
These are understandable: many have to give each other.
Truce with the weapons on foot, yesterday, the PSD.
Everyone pulls their soul
The camps in the PSD branch of ieșeană concluded a truce with a knife in his leg.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first and the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to suspend temporarily hostilities.
Under pressure from the party's executive chairman, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, ieșeni Social Democrats will send him a list of potential candidates for positions in the party.
Far from being completed, the domestic war party appears to have just taken a break to allow combatants to shoot his soul.
Dragnea has not given an ultimatum.
It has launched a very simple message and very current conditions now: try to find a solution in order not to jeopardise the party.
On 3 October we have elections in the party.
All functions will be available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain within the existing structure," said Acting Mayor Michael Chirica.
The two days of weekend talks have only led to the conclusion that nothing has been set.
In the October elections, for the post of president of the county branch of the PSD is expected to have a strong competition.
On the short list of potential candidates for the top post in the party's ieșeană branch is Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, an adviser of the county Vasile Câtea and acting chairman of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
They could also add comunei mayor Schitu Duca, Michael Mihalache.
One option considered is the leader of the PSD county councillors, Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu will not enroll in the race, sources within the party saying that he is not interested in office.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations over the past few days is the former leader of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, including applications can be made on Election Day, and would not Mira anyone if it would happen.
"What is important is that we remain united, and we will stay and after 3 October, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent Bureau County and all the structures of new leadership," said Câtea.
Until the election, the county branch of the PSD will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close aide to Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu is, however, to leave until 29 September, election preparation in practice and will be provided by the Executive branch secretary of the county adviser Mikhail Popescu, who was in cold relations with Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu praised the talks in recent days as leading to "a partial consensus."
There is a broad willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A consensus has been reached in part, in terms of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variants of intentions related to accession to the PSD Ia?i, the list remains open," commented Stanciu.
A ieșean judge refused to file rapists in Vaslui
The seven young men from the county Vaslui convicted of rape today goes to the Court of Appeal Ia?i.
Vasluienii sentenced to imprisonment of between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments on their freedom, after the court fund, Judecătoria Vaslui, set their imprisonment immediately after sentence.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal late last week, magistrate Dan Anton making a request for abstinence, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton cited the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Luca Bogdan, is his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton concubinul.
Luca defends Ovidiu Silviu Burada, who received the greatest punishment in this dossier.
As the judges have motivated sentence
Late last week, the Judecătoria Vaslui magistrate who sentenced seven people to motivated sentence.
The judge speaks of defiant reaction to the defendants, but also those who have supported him, adding that such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among the public.
"The court finds that after the placing under preventive measure of judicial control, restrictive measure of freedom but not custodial freedom, under the impact of the defendants' attitude, families and their local supporters, was felt in the local community and a strong sense of indignation about the fact that people accused of serious crimes are prosecuted under a less restrictive measure," reads the motivating Judecătoriei Vaslui.
Also, the judges were dismantled and the defence of the seven defendants during the trial cited the fact that the girl who raped her there would be "the door of the church."
"The court sublinază that is devoid of the moral relevance of the injured person, which the defendants wanted to highlight the probe they formulated, as physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be broken under any pretext," says the driver.
Corbyn, Brexit-ul and the future of Europe
In economic and demographic factors, the prosperity they enjoyed in the past dozen years can no longer continue in the coming years.
Until Saturday, probably a little known world in Romania who is Jeremy Corbyn.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many are wondering how we can affect the election of a politician who, after all, is hardly in a position of decision.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leader of stângist laburiștilor after the war.
Marxist anti-monarhist (asked at one point Tony Blair, then prime minister, to take the royal family of Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathiser of Vladimir Putin (otherwise has been regularly invited to comment on political events by the TV channel "Russia Today"), and the terrorist movement Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to abandon nuclear weapons and to get out of NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who was considered at the time of killing Osama bin Laden as a tragedy, ISIS is close to the United States.
After all the demagogilor populists, Corbyn has, of course, anti-austerity miraculous solutions.
Things of the kind that he used them and promised them and Tsipras in Greece until the chest with the real world and economic legitățile.
The economics of the new Labour leader provides, among other things, massive renaționalizări and printing of money as a solution for the financing of development projects and to cover some very generous social benefits.
Sure, some might wonder why the solution of printing money is not widely adopted across the globe, then we will have an overall global prosperity!, but who is to prevent more such details.
Sure, we can tax them to blood bankers, becoming a kind of enemies of the left, but as has been seen by so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterrand and Hollande.
Additional sums are quickly înghițite generous promises, without backing, populist demagogues.
As it drew attention to Margaret Thatcher, "the problem with socialism is that at some point ends other people's money."
Few give it a good chance of Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister ever.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, which however was not as extreme in the belief that the party's leadership has failed miserably in the elections.
And then still exist in Britain a muncitorească class, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential than now.
In the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant in the labour force, and extensive automatizări resulted in the industry to be heavily qualified, the rhetoric of Corbyn has a limited appeal.
But, even in opposition, he can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
In its latest Financial Times believes that the election of Corbyn is Brexit-ului chances, leaving Britain in the EU.
The new Labour leader has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the European Union.
In the eyes of radical Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a proponent of globalisation that austerity has been imposed on the poor.
When combini such ideas with the view expressed by the radical right, with rhetoric anti-immigration and look at the refugee crisis that is shaking the foundations reach an explosive mixaj.
And not only for Britain.
But if the British decide following the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the symbolic loss of capital for the entire European project and deep fault lines created inside the Euro and now why refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leaves room for scenarios of the most worrying.
The more so as to a whole series of Member States, London was a counterbalance to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin is increasingly becoming dominant actor).
Admittedly, British business, the City, are strong advocates of the country's backwardness in the EU.
But Europe today is no longer in the past.
There are many resentment, which are growing in intensity even during these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels had just recently a specimen in a speech by Jean Clude Junker, an increasing trend to take major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States and in consultation with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And that is what happens when the electoral support for the antisistem, anti-immigration who are at the same time, and Eurosceptic is rising dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative overtones has reached higher levels than ever in the past.
And the conclusion that it is a Financial Times when it assesses Brexit-ului chances.
Pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from the national interest.
If voters decide brain, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But the victory of Corbyn recalls the excitement in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe may be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we will see a greater integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and at the periphery of the decisionmaking process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras, the Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States is fueling its populist rhetoric of accumulated frustrations in oocidentale societies.
In economic and demographic factors, the prosperity they enjoyed in the past dozen years, generous social benefits, it can no longer continue in the coming years.
Under pressure from explosive dual crisis, Eurozone - immigration, both caused by rash decisions which have not taken into account than integrationist dogma any more political ambitions, and not the capacity and willingness of the peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence of the continent, internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can affect Romania's situation.
And it is hard to excluzi something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are unable to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brancusi, farmer's god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brancusi: "Take the broom workshop!"
The great sculptor has had a great dream: to be someone, to be famous, to hear about it all over the world.
Behind his renumelui hide, but something almost forgotten today, when we have delivered millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.
Something also has a name.
It is called "trudă."
What to write about Constantin Brancusi?
What's actually said?
His figure appeared on banknotes.
And, recently, a well-known bank in Romania has hired an actor to play in an advert today.
Brancusi manufactures and supplies money for nearly 60 years since it is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and bulevarde bearing his name.
In fact, even the author of this piece lives on one of these streets.
And when she comes out on top with odrasla, hears the following instructions: "Walk in the park, Brancusi."
The country is împânzită of its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works will be known as world, from children to seniors.
The infiltration of Brancusi is a huge one.
Even the Communists have not succeeded extirpe in Romania's memory and culture.
His quotations today plaster the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of like-uri and share-uri.
And, then, again, what would be better to say about this man?
Viewed from books and articles that try to ensure the destiny of Brancusi life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell me that, if you have not had luck to you ' re born in any big city and into a wealthy family, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
His life is Brancusi contraexemplul perfectly.
And maybe there would be a key.
Maybe there should be a text that follows.
With a sentence, no matter how loathsome they are.
Forget about cretine success stories, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on television.
Look carefully at this figure.
Do you want to know how to succeed in life, how, today, he heard a whole world?
It is simple.
He has worked all her life to be someone.
This is what has been done.
Constantin Brancusi was born on 19 February 1876, in Hobița, a small village in Peștișani, Gorj County, at the foot the Carpathian.
It is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancusi.
Although it came from a wealthy family of peasants, Brancusi leads a modest life, but one of which will have to reap their benchmarks that will guide his artistic vision.
Remembering my childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist had to confess, at a meeting with Țuțea Petre, in Paris, in 1933: "Then life was beautiful and harmonious."
For millennia, people, happy, sought a patriarchal life.
Everything was going down from one season to another.
And you know what changed things?
Great civilisation has come to us.
His childhood Brancusi was still far from a bucolic one.
One of the moments that occurred in these early years of life is highly revealing for the combination of purity and violence that have characterised the sculptor years spent in the home.
It is time for reproducing in the "Brancusi. Biography," written by Alexander Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brancusi was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when it was țuica, watching those who degustă lichidul to see if the process is carried out properly, Brancusi catch a moment of general neatenție.
Fill their căușul palmelor with țuică and drink nerăsuflate.
Falls in sleep almost instantly.
The first people barely notice after a few minutes.
My mother is in panic, then in hysteria, believing that her son died.
By evening, when his father, Radu return to living with lăutari, sees it in away desperate signs of those who are waiting for him with heart in mouth.
Spending immediately turns into jale.
The father is already thinking about îngropăciune.
However, one finds that it is good to have a phone on Brândușa Baba, doftoroaie and Brâncușilor servants.
Brândușa checked my breath, then put them under balegă horse, gathered in preajmă.
Strănută child.
The world applauds.
While the boy is left to sleep his further beția, joy, with lăutari party continues with even greater force.
The next day, the father and son meet through the orchard.
Radu Brancusi put it on Constantine to collect some nuiele and to bring them.
His father sets the top-down and nuielele boy, knocking him to remember.
And, while it feels usturimea blows, the tiny Brancusi has revelation that the world can be seen from another perspective, and that things around toppling can arise.
Especially the sun, different from the well-known, I do wonder, as you have to admit to old age, unless he himself astrul to attend his trepidation.
And the sun was just as disturbed as his father of what is being întâmplase?.
At present, the city does not work
An MP is calling on politicians to remember those who have voted him.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuț has appealed to the PSD and PNL to stop the infighting and reorient its agenda for voters.
What we see now in our politics is a big divide and both.
I have not seen anything from USL projects in 2012 to continue.
Neither highway nor Regional Emergency Spital, just watch how politicians dispute their possible locations depending on the real estate interests.
We can put a bit aside, let us gather and talk.
At present, the city is not working.
"If you are busy with internal warfare, you have no more time for those who have chosen," said Blăjuț.
He appreciated that the current political class has dezămăgit ieșean electorate, the consequence would be a very low turnout in the upcoming local elections, around 30% figure, which is basically true to the electorate of the party.
The MP also believes that voters will move increasingly towards traditional parties, expressing some reservations about the new policy initiatives, as in the "For Ia?i" which will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break from right-wing voters, not from the PSD.
Such parties are based on active civic people, who usually are right.
"Fărâmițează is further right, which is not good for anyone, nor for the PSD," said Blăjuț.
He made it clear that he is not interested in a candidacy in the upcoming local elections, denying rumours about his intention to enroll in the race for City Hall.
I said that I do not mean I ran into any local office.
I am thinking more about whether to continue as a Member and in the future.
I tried to call for unity in Iasi and in discussions in the corridors, with other parliamentarians, and I have been charged that I want to make my picture.
I do not want, but we can no longer continue in this way.
"If people have voted us, does not mean that they are stupid to vote if they do not see anything," said Blăjuț, who said that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of being made by MPs.
A colleague from Tătărași said he does not get the money and must go by bus.
Let us not be hypocrites.
They are not cheap.
Sometimes ashamed to raise money in the kitty.
At the end of the mandate shall make a report with everything we spent outside the salaries of government employees and its maintenance.
It happened to rise in a month and 30000 lei, with all deconturile transportation, accommodation and other.
"To tell an MP that does not get the money that is downright hypocrisy," concluded Blăjuț.
