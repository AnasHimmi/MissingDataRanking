Head of the UN says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says its response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that has lasted almost five years and several weapons would not exacerbate the violence and misery of millions of people.
The head of the UN again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council to unite and support the negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday at a conference that it intends to meet this month with the foreign ministers of the five permanent countries present in the council - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation intractable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they failed to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
Eight figures in the polls which show that Donald Trump has a real chance
Some have tried to label him as a politician "flip-flop."
Others have called him a joke.
Others expect the implosion.
But regardless of how some republicans trying to remove him on Donald Trump in the polls, has not worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads with a percentage of the two figures and some are beginning to wonder seriously what does this mean for the real estate mogul's nomination chances.
Of course, it is still premature.
None of this says that Trump will win the race for the nomination of the Republicans.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advances are made out of Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the race for the nomination.
And the reasons why they would fight hard in the general elections are numerous.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super CAP and economic conservative group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and begin to support it with money.
I put some figures in recent polls which suggest that the real estate mogul is not just something passing:
The figures that show support to Trump returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump to announce their candidacy, in the middle of June, a poll conducted by Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republican had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
Until the middle of July, the percentage rose to 40%.
At the beginning of August, was 52%.
Currently, six of the 10 republicans have a positive opinion about Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative view.
These figures are maintained.
A poll last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa found that 60% of Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump would win the race for the nomination.
In a poll conducted last week by CNN / ORC, 67% of republicans have said it would be "enthusiastic" or "pleased" if Trump could win the race for the nomination.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if Trump could win the race for the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be "enthusiastic" about 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other side, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if frontrunner Jeb Bush wins the race for the nomination.
Most Republicans do not think Trump's temperament a problem.
While Donald Trump has been heavily criticised for the insults and his bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters nationally believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to the poll conducted Monday by ABC News / Washington Post.
Find the same figures in the state of Iowa, where all 52% of republicans think Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44 per cent are of the opinion that does not have the personality necessary to act effectively and nearly six in 10 independent says his temperament has no place in the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are obișnuiesc with the idea.
When I take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters believe Trump is authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN / ORC, to the question of who is most likely to win the race for the GOP nomination, four in 10 said that Trump.
The situation has changed towards the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, GOP voters have not read very well the future.
In the same period of the last election, four in 10 Republican elected Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, compared with only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP voters consider plausible Trump's campaign.
Even if Republicans or turned to another candidate, Trump still tops all.
Some say the split will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while support for Trump's will share in more than a dozen candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by Monmouth University shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always receive majority support.
Trump is at a distance of 13 points of Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio at 14 points, 15 points from Walker, 19 points of Jeb Bush and, ultimately, to 33 points to Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It is almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can defeat?
Ben Carson would defeat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation one to one.
Most of the supporters of Donald Trump says have been decided.
A new poll conducted Tuesday by CBS / NYT shows that more than half of the voters who support Trump says he does not change its option.
Obviously, much can happen in this, and no one can say that they will never change.
The 46% say portița leaves open the possibility of change the option.
However, the most important adversary of Trump is currently neurochirurgul Ben Carson, but is two times more likely voters who say they have decided to vote for Trump.
Six of the 10 Republican says that I agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
When Donald Trump called on immigrants from Mexico as "rapists" in the opening speech of his campaign, two months ago, immigration was a central issue in the campaign for 2016.
Some are worried that Trump's bombast would lead to a split between the major hispanici voters and the Republican Party and will harm the rebranding efforts.
But, according to the poll conducted by ABC / Post Monday, six in 10 Republican says that I agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the issue of immigration remains in the spotlight, as will remain and Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities reach new culmi.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely because of their status outsideri.
According to the poll conducted by ABC / Post Monday, six in 10 Republican says he prefers a political outsider at the expense of someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republican in Iowa are frustrated by the service Republicans in congress, 54% saying he was "dissatisfied" and 21% "nervoși at culme."
Jeremy Corbyn is making its debut at Prime Minister's questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn at PMQs debut was long expected
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, later will make its debut at Prime Minister's questions, for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions that has the right shortly after lunch; his service will probably be examined closely by the media and Labour MPs.
The weekly aparițiilor, he called for "less theatrical and more facts."
Also said he may give up some participation and that they succumb to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be the first test of Mr Corbyn MP in the leading position, coming after he called a "shadow cabinet" and after the speech he gave on Tuesday at the TUC annual congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to keep silent about speaking the national anthem during a service held Tuesday on the anniversary of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England has drawn criticism from some conservative lawmakers and made the headlines.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he "respectfully silent" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British air forces in the Battle of England."
But a shadow cabinet member of Mr Corbyn, Owen Smith, told the Two's Newsnight reported by the BBC that he would have recommended the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around a dozen ministers in the cabinet ghost refused to be part of the team led by Mr Corbyn, arguing through differences of opinion about the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, says political differences "gets" in the Labour Party after the appointment of Mr Corbyn on its position towards the European Union and the benefits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party will bring changes that will eliminate entirely the idea of limiting.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Work and Pensions Minister, said the party is "very clear" in the sole opposition to government plans to reduce the "head" from 26.000 pounds at 23.000 pounds.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader facing David Cameron at the rostrum in the last decade, since he assumed the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from external sources" for questions to ask God Cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
Islington North MP said PMQs implies a level of confrontation too high and that they will refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take place at PMQs when he cannot attend - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also expressed the idea that will allow others to speak occasionally, saying that he has addressed the President of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he assumed the leadership, Mr Cameron said he wants to give up political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs but acknowledged a few years later he has failed in his approach.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs was considered a key barometer of raționamentului a leader, of how he leads the Chamber of Deputies and its position among his fellow MPs, although critics say it has become a caricature and that requires a deep reform.
"The framework in Joburg": Young homeless enjoy photography courses
It is difficult to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood have found a way to learn a trade and earn a living.
"He was shot in Joburg" is a non- profit studio that teach young homeless to take photos of the areas in which they live and to make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports chief says that higher wages could harm the expansion
The JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says an increase in the minimum wage in Britain could mean "a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, it is unlikely that the purchasing power to overcome the higher costs for the workforce within the company, he says.
The costs could have an impact on the plans for expansion of JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by the President of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and criticized for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was collateral victim in the "storm" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios and his behaviour deserves more praise and criticism, in the opinion of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest of the talented duo set, often called the "Special KS bearing plates,", was dragged into an unpleasant in the spotlight by derapajul scandalous that Kyrgios had to Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a very hard game of skill played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair of the referee had to intervene twice to despărți on Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison after Harrison said: "Wawrinka was supposed to bring down the Kyrgios, and I should have put it down on this puștiul."
Although he was last seen making a rocket dust after he had crampe back and missed a possible US Open tournament, upset over Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was strongly defended by Healy.
Teenager is currently in Glasgow, where struggle with Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
"One thing that I feel strongly is that, in my opinion, a bit Thanasi was drawn into the conflict," Healy said.
The truth is that he has broken a rocket when he lost because the accused crampe in the US, but it is not the first player to break a rocket in frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that there would be proud of that.
But to be serious, it has permeated extremely well in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think it deserves a lot of confidence.
It has a great team, has a great family together and I think he was treated unfairly.
It is a very mature young man of 19 years, is working hard and has been integrated into the team, has not had any conflict with the other players, is highly respected in the changing rooms, trains hard, is in excellent form, is a very balanced and mature, and I think it deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and faults.
Healy also supported the decision to not take into account the important Kyrgios for the station, which starts on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most suitable for everyone, but supported the return player originally from Canberra in the long run in the team.
"First, we want the team to focus entirely on the station and not think at all about the controversy surrounding his [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick moved very quickly, as they said people like Federer and Murray, he maturizează under the eyes of the public and made some terrible mistakes and deserve to be criticised, but we are trying to support, we try to help him understand the consequences of it, and I think it needs a time when they are not in the spotlight to be able to reflect, good thing both for the team and for him.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders has been cut in half in national polls
Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, still has an advantage of two figures in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senatorul Bernie Sanders gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of voters Democrats (down from 58%), while Sanders is second, with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he would run for the presidency, is supported by 15% of voters democrats.
At least five months before the primary election, the majority of Democrats say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
The poll conducted by CBS news last month, Clinton has lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has gained a few points.
Clinton maintains the advantage among women and moderaților, but the advantage was reduced.
Support among men has shrunk considerably, and Sanders is at a distance of only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among voters Democrats under the age of 50 years has evaporated, and is now on par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in the lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders, with a percentage of the two figures, among liberals, but Sanders now has an easy advantage of 5 points in this group.
Nearly half of voters from national Democrats say they would support it with enthusiasm for Clinton if he had chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support a somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it only because it is the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters to be enthusiastic about its choice is high.
Views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48% of Democrats say they would support it with enthusiasm for Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same thing about the first ranked Donald Trump (35 per cent) is lower.
When Clinton's supporters are sending an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority is having the proper experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that it is the best candidate for this position (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentions her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
It also mentions the agreement on these issues and eligibility.
Given that the Deputy takes into account a possible presidential bid, 57% of voters Democrats would like to see him in the race - although a third think it should not run.
The question on the second option for the party, the voters Democrats call it a majority on Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half said that Biden would be the second option, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the race for the Democratic party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders's rise, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if it is running.
55% of voters Democrats see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the general election; but the numbers have dropped from 78% as they were last month.
Biden is in second place but the percentage that is most eligible grew.
However, when asked what is most important in a candidate elected, voters prefer Democrats over eligibility issues.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate is not considered by these voters as unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well in terms of several key features to their party's primary voters.
The majority of voters considers Clinton, Sanders and Biden as integrity and trust and with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen the best of all three in terms of integrity, during which Clinton's strength is leadership.
The 30% of voters Democrats don't think H. Clinton is trustworthy and integră, two times more than those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% have no opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters generally also believes that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideology as well.
On all these issues, about a quarter of the voters Democrats do not have an opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist about the use of a personal email address and server by Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State, the majority of Democrats are satisfied with their explanation on the subject and say that it has not affected the overall opinion of the candidate.
But it is different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion has been divided on this issue in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans say the controversy over email has not affected the overall opinion about Clinton, while 36% say they have changed their opinion in a negative sense.
Mainly Republicans, more than six in 10 say they have changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative sense.
Although a Democrat voters believe Clinton integră and trust, it continues to raise concerns among voters overall: Only 32% consider integră and reliable, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not believe integră and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level does not consider Trump upstanding and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white ball for the leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush ranks first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders upstanding is higher than those who are not of the same opinion, however, as in the case of Carson, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 voters democrats mayors is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the brotherhood indicted for the murder of student in year 1 at Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during a ritual of birth in Munții Pocono in Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the brotherhood IP Delta PSI within Facultății Baruch in New York brutally attacked on chun "Michael" Deng during a ritual of birth in September 2013 and stopped to take him to the hospital, which has contributed to his death, according to police.
Official sources say that the victim was related to the eyes, he was placed in the back of a backpack 14 kg filled with sand and was repeatedly bullied while trying to move towards a target on the frozen ground.
Mr. Deng has accused headaches after they lost anyway.
Members of the brotherhood IP Delta PSI had not called the emergency number after he fainted and claim that he had waited an hour before taking it to the hospital, police said.
However, they found the time to change the clothes of Deng, to seek his symptoms on Google and to contact him on Andy Meng, the brotherhood at national level, to seek advice, said police chief, Chris Wagner, at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide personal belongings and have basically the brotherhood before Michael Deng's good," said Wagner.
He could not be revived and died the next day morning.
According to a report by autopsie, Deng has suffered repeated trauma to the head, log and coapse.
"Too many families have been devastated by frățiilor rituals, in 1970, at least one student lost their lives every year because of the rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, in a statement.
Frățiile and their members should be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
Monroe district's grand jury has recommended that the first five members to be charged with the murder of the three.
Thirty and two other mebrii of brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be placed under indictment for disrespect and complicity in murder.
"We want to be held accountable not only the individuals involved but, if there is an organisation which gave the Muslim, formally or informally, we will also hold accountable," Wagner said Tuesday at a press conference.
Faculty Baruch has banned the Muslim and the Muslim national withdrew its affiliation with the local branch.
This is what will happen when the Fed will raise interest rates
Interest rates will rise and the Bull (rising market) will be red, bond returns will increase and the economy will go into recession.
What we know.
What we do not know is how long it will happen and how long it will take.
In economics, history offers few clues on the time.
After the first would increase the interest rate, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor of how the response to the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when starting to raise interest rates but on the trajectory of time needed for normalisation.
Indeed, there are multiple variables at play.
But, in the end, the players on the market could see that all the uproar over interest rate rises has been exaggerated.
"The first increase in interest rate set by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the era of" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we expect a gradual return of the US interest rates to more normal levels but still small to constitute seismic shock that seem to fear all.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Still present how they could react some sectors of the economy, based on historical trends:
In view of the situation in which the market has faced in recent months, anticipating interest rate rise can volatiliza things a while.
But, at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a tendency for the return on capital to stagnate for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which reflects perhaps defazajul again in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed.
Specifically, in the past 35 years, the market has risen sharply - about 14 percent - heading towards raising interest rates, quite invariabilă from 250 days after (up an average of 2.6%) after which returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by Nuveen Asset Management's chief strategist.
Deutsche said the impact on the actions has tended to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rising interest rates and the benefits are starting to fall.
The recession is a fact of economic life, but rising interest rates often contributes to it.
In the current situation else, the Fed faces some conditions that have not existed before and which could precipitate a recession.
More specifically, the gross domestic product will be closer to its historic low point for a Fed interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only two times nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even if in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Rising interest rates in an economy so fragile could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market players have prepared all year for a decision from the Fed increase, all eyes are ațintiți at this week's meeting of the Federal Committee of the Open Square, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists are of the opinion that the FOMC could approve an increase in interest rates at this meeting, the term transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study conducted after 1950, all cycles of increasing interest rates so far have been in a super cycle of rising profits, dwarfing the spearheads GDP before the recession very quickly after the start of the recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, it was a strange slow recovery after the worst recession in the period examined.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed at the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and he has reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of the dividend.
The main difference is that the impact is more quickly in the case of bonds than in the case of when the Fed changes its policy.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits of changing the direction once it produces the first increase / decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of rising interest rates, the return on bonds is immediately, "said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab strategies are of the opinion that these increases in interest rates will determine the profitability of bonds in the short term and the long term, aplatizând curve.
Bonds with high profitability is doing better in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about forcing the profitability," said in an analysis Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of the Fed.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and lower inflation estimates, there are few signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short term interest rates have increased profitability curve is right, the increase in the average interest rate of credit has been extended and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed has been tightening policy.
Broadly, companies operating the majority in the US will benefit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the rising dollar will lead to the rise of their products in the global market and their duty will be more expensive.
"History shows that the" quality "stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months after an initial rise in interest rates," Goldman Sachs analyst said in a report to clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets have outperformed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large receipts from capital and with stocks with low volatility have also outperformed similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), 3 (percentage points).
The debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a large percentage of debt flotantă have the most to lose, says Goldman.
Consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Those who save could also benefit, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classics FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticised the broadcaster for "prostește"
He says it is increasingly similar to commercial opponent
Has also taken the eye BBC Music Awards, claiming plagiarism Brits awards
Damien Collins attacked fellow The Voice, saying that this show is not the original
BBC Radio 3 "turns into" Classics FM, said a senior lawmaker, putting pressure on the post to prove that doing something that commercial stations are not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has also sent the BBC bosses that public radio station "prostește" and looks increasingly with commercial adversary.
"I have the impression that Radio 3" prostește "- although I do not like to use the word - but I have the impression that turns into Classics FM," he said.
Has also taken the eye BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, Brits seem to be under another name.
So, if you are trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind which merely duplicate what is already on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
The director general of the BBC has denied the accusations, saying that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his challenger trade on live music and educating the public.
I will not know anything about classical music they hear on Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important commitment of Radio 3 to discover new music and the allocation of new plays," he said.
In the first part of this year, the editor of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that we need to work harder to attract audiența compared to the previous period because Britons have less knowledge about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the banner of the BBC criticised at a meeting of the Committee for Culture, Media and Sport because it would go on the trail of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the show of talent bought by the BBC from the Dutch producer Talpa Media for the approximately 22 million pounds.
You understand why there are often discussions about the show because it is not original and does not distinguish itself by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the show made by the BBC1 - with Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - to be done "in a specific manner the BBC."
He added that the corporation wants to "find a chicken with golden eggs in their own house" next time launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the future takeover of new seasons of The Voice or to spend the money that is spent on licences in other entertainment formats.
Internet sales have recorded the lowest growth in August and the culprit could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales rose by 7%.
In the last month has been the most sluggish growth from 2000 until now.
Online sales have taken off three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to make purchases.
Specialists believe that Black Friday's November could determine the reluctance to expenses.
For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned Britain's commercial streets into ghost towns.
Experts say, however, that there are signs that online sales are, the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of the year 2015.
The total money spent in August showed the smallest increase since 2000, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Specialists say that there are signs that online sales are, the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of the year 2015.
"If you look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there was always the tendency of streamlined over time," said Andy Mulcahy, an editor at IMRG sales index, for the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when buyers have started to use mobile phones to make purchases.
Thus, has increased the number of people who could make online purchases and could do in various circumstances, such as on canapea.
But now that stalled a little, you could see a decrease (increase).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the fall in sales.
In the opinion of the specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases ahead of the event which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers flocked to computers to put their hands on the bids, which led to the collapse of several retailers websites.
Specialists believe that Black Friday, when shoppers were beaten on bargains, could determine the reluctance of buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium has determined that at least £1 in every £5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machinery, more than a third of the purchases is currently via online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the Bin Laden family fining, Muslims bury the victims killed in the collapse of the mecca macaralei
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were plimbate streets by Muslims, the first funeral taking place in mecca.
Saudi Arabia has blamed partly on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
Minister of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured following the collapse of macaralei
In the walk on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them on the 29 victims, killed because of a prăbușite cranes at the grand mosque in mecca.
Îmbrăcați in white, those who are crying death joined on the road to express their condolences, until the first dead arrived at the end of the final journey, Al-Moaissem cemetery.
Sad memories preserved by the holy site, where just a few days ago collapsed a construction crane by tavanul Moscheei, falling on credincioși.
The bodies were released for the funeral after Saudi King to sanction the construction of the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also ended with 394 wounded.
At the ceremony carried out on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them on the 29 victims, killed because of a prăbușite cranes at the grand mosque in mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, on his first pilgrimage when macaraua collapsed.
Mr Akram was in the Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj pelerinajului.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to the mecca continues, thousands of pilgrims still standing in the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group would not have had to leave macaralei arm raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi press agency, said the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the collapse.
The English service of the news agency gave no detail, but said that the company received a ban from leaving the country.
Earlier during the week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse macaralei in the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have come before pelerinajului hajj which takes place later this month.
Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse macaralei and representatives of the Group could not be contactați for statements.
The royal decree has blamed the group for not used the updated safety measures and has coordinated work with the weather.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and running major construction projects.
The Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a son "turncoat" dezmoștenit family in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in conditions of strong wind and rain, with only a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, travel essential at least once in the life of every Muslim physically fit.
Authorities say the 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities have decided that the relatives of the deceased victims to receive one million (£174.000 Riali saudiți) and the same amount to pay those with permanent injuries.
Other injuries will receive half of that amount.
The advantages and disadvantages of conversion credit in francs elvetieni
The market's already occurred two bids for conversion into lei credit elvetieni francs, the main advantages are excluding currency risk and reduce rates.
Disadvantages can come over several years ago, when the variable interest can lead to higher rates.
The Transylvania Bank has just completed the process of conversion of credit in francs granted by Volksbank and Post Bank announced the conversion to own clienti.
According to the data accumulated by analysts FinZoom financial portal, Post Bank provides three years of fixed interest at the lions, 1.5%, the smallest market.
On the other hand, the conversion of the Transylvania Bank was accepted by 83% of clientii with credit in francs due to a second successive cuts: It has reduced the value of the balance of risk and management fees paid by the customer, then applied a reduction suplimentara by 22.5% to balance in the lions.
Both bids are cutting their rates clienti, as monthly Plateau equivalent in lions before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate of 42.5% and Post Bank, with 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, with 18 per cent in the next five years.
The benefits
The main advantage of the lions covresiei credit in CHF is that they remove the currency risk, the consumer is protected from future cresterile of Francs and repaying the loan will be made in the currency in which it incaseaza salary.
Another major advantage of both offers of conversion is that there is a reassessment of the property, no longer require additional guarantees and another proof of income.
Basically, there will be a new financial and legal analysis of the credit and will not be additional costs as in the case of a refinantari.
Also, both banks are offering reduction in the monthly rate, as Plateau clientii before conversion, equivalent to lions.
Of risks
The problem is that the rate in the early years were more of interest, and very little from the main ramburseaza client.
The Post Bank with very little interest in the first three years seems beneficial for clienti.
But not knowing how it will evolve this interest after three years.
The margin provided may be looking more than 3.25%, so, in total, and the reduction of costs is less.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest, is that the index ROBOR grow significantly in the next five years (more than the Libor - CHF).
For example ROBOR three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 had reached the value of 6% in 2009 to more than 15%, and in a few days in 2008 overtook 40%!
In addition, it is possible to and other costs, nementionate in the initial offer.
It is time for decisions on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world ațintește its attention towards meeting scheduled over two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will take the crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, a little more than half that last week thought that the decision will be made, I think now that the situation will still maintain a while and that interest rates will be kept within the current 0 to 0.25%.
It is a historic event because seven years have passed since the Fed has raised rates to zero.
For the first time, we are faced with a situation where a major central bank could go from zero rate and to initiate a process of normalisation of interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, recovery with trillions of dollars in the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Fed must not ignore the global situation less rosy.
Warned to prepare markets for an increase, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is less likely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20: 00 TEC.

Luke Shaw player from Manchester United sits on the men a few months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a fractured twice in the leg in the match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, which ended with a defeat to Holland's PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the eyes and a player who will keep the men for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
Injuring occurred following a reckless interventions from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, 20 years, broke Holland's PSV defence.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "Has a double in the leg and is in the hospital."
Will be transferred tomorrow or the day after tomorrow then it will be operated in Manchester.
It is appalling - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18 years old, are experiencing difficulties, then play fantastic and now is it.
In the locker room has put the oxygen mask.
Well. Plângea
I am not a doctor, but in a dual repausul is six months and will not play in the grupelor.
I hope to be able to play again this season.
It appears that Moreno had luck and escaped a red card and the concession of penalties.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli was punished the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for themselves when I say that it is a foul and a red card.
It was a very ugly intervention, with two legs.
A message on the Twitter account of Shaw: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how I feel weakened, start the road to recovery, I will come back stronger."

Phillip Cocu, Holland's PSV coach, said: "It is a very urată injury."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players are never to accidenteze an adversary.
Moreno has broken leg playing for national naționala Mexico against the Netherlands led by Van Gaal at the World Cup in 2014.
"It is very difficult because it did not intend to hurt their opponent, and when you hear that this is a very serious injury, it is not good," said Cocu.
I have not seen the stage.
We have not managed to see than the ball, heading in a different direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it but I could not see on Luke's intervention.
In the statement the SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to pass through it.
I feel bad foare, I am so sorry.
Holland's PSV player, Andrés Guardado, also arrived at the hospital after an intervention from Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has risked clear the omission of England but it is still out
The victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after I saw selecționată England team for the tournament, do not take into account a repeat of 3-0 defeat in the test.
I would not eliminate any variant of a victory in the trip.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good players on the spin in the batting and collective morale is strong; it will be the goings marcați in 2012 but will have a positive attitude, youthful.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if it is unknown at the level of testing, is an option for the attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth has left the England team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it is difficult to look at the decision not to select him on Adam Lyth in the team.
He played seven matches against two good atacanți test, in difficult conditions, and simple but the harsh reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no question marks over Joe Root, for example, until announcements have been made because - and I have said it before - the players are their own selecționeri.
Some fifty years and perhaps Lyth had extended the run but his fate is in his hands.
I hope that if you do more run workshops for Yorkshire will be part of other opportunities.
England team's main coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised the attitude even when the performance was not matched by his ability and I am not surprised that; above all, is a man of the team.
It is hard to answer the question of how long is noticed a batsman in Test matches.
Lyth had seven run businesses - as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had luck at home and away.
The only anger that you had was that England was preferred to Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in top form - but the missed opportunity is in the past.
The team is Alex Hales, a batsman that cotez very well.
It is a cricket player who has the "X factor" and that I noticed earlier in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge pitch.
Should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea was launched as Moeen to open its mouth with Cook, which would lead the off spinner while keeping four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a aruncător could not hit there and this clumsy player has already demonstrated that it is given naibii.
Perhaps Moeen has not brought the success in his district, Worcestershire, was No 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old colleague team, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games 38 as the first drop test prior to open in 2001.
He immediately deleted three centuries and has not looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team on the back up spinner, and although we had a limited contact with him, it struck me that it is a very impressive young man.
People may judge his young age - with an average of 31 to 35 and kicking the ball - and could think it's punt, but there is a lot of selecționerii spinneri and opted for youth.
Will learn a lot from this tournament.
England has made some changes in the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the test could be a blow to master.
It is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in every situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to White Ball link out of the tournament and will bring both energy and merciless ambition.
I have always believed that was born to engage in the international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela has intuiție.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if they send messages that have been sent and previously, can bring fresh air into the team.
His colleague Colly's Durham, Ben Stokes odihnește themselves for the day, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although I am not all agree, coaches and selecționerii does not make the programme.
And we should note, the jobs of players depend on the results that we get.
Such decisions are not taken never easy.
The Brexit could win if the economy remains in the lull until 2017
Every day, the renegotiation of David Cameron to keep Britain in the EU are growing louder in the mess, even without the genialului Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn to the leadership of the Labour Party or the TUC brings severe criticism from Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have also characters such as Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained the past that - sunken in crisis similar to that of the EU - not all of which are caused internally - some Member States are powered by Britain's agenda concessions and changes to the treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC has decided that they don't want it if it would erode social protection.
We could even call it the "selfie" of Dave and George.
Prime Minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without a local representative, then come home and say they have gained allies for reform.
It is just about me.
My friend, who wants a Great Britain with outward perspective under EU acoperișul - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that several ministers and officials obtuzi in some capitals have reached the point where don't care if they stay or go.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor extremely cautious, is an ally but has been at the helm for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation to unravel, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, the President of France, François Hollande, will be reappointed or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a nationalist government right, Spain one of the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland out of Britain - something that we do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even going to intentionally make remarks that does not help, in the SNP in the referendum campaign in Britain in 2017 to speed up the process of Brexit, suggests his Serb best friend of mine.
"The renegotiation was fixed" and "Britain has not achieved anything of value in the renegotiation."
Europeans know on their skin as acaparatoare may be Fleet Street and how skeptical are oligarchic media barons who view the EU with scepticism because they did not participate in the referendum in 1975 inspired by Tony Benn, who has ratified our entry from 1973 to 2: 1.
Can vaguely remember by Boris Johnson, the euro oportunistul, who became famous in the early 1990s when it was corespodent of Brussels.
ED Miliband was aware of their enemies.
They included the pungași neplătitori taxes, foreign fraudau telephone and pseudo non- Domi who hold most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair is seen in much the same way but has realised that when you are closed in a gorila cușcă alongside a nervous, we must give them bananas to distract attention from the thought of you eat at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to the idea of Cameron's referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the EU constitution abandoned, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a card out.
The media has not forgiven him for that.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who has reached the prietenește back Monday in Westminster - I told him not to spend more time with me - seems to be in danger from egg to adopt the strategy Murdoch boycott of Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It can take, but we need to develop a coherent strategy for cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left open on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I would call with indulgence development.
He says he would like to stay in a reformed EU.
The majority of those who do not agree with "anglicismul" conservatives could agree with that.
It said "A Hilary Benn, not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and TV this week, when he's cercetașul fought not to recognise that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as minister "shadow" financial problems was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on TV to be unfairly Labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing his position in the cabinet.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But the fight to stay "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond with what he said McDonnell nor with what he said JC colleagues and lawmakers in the private meeting Monday night.
Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to send - note, I awareness and me - messaging discipline remains important in the era of television, and especially in the maelstrom of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to be given a ticket for Cameron's favour in Europe, enabling them to take good laburiștilor support in the campaign for the referendum, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell's basic sofismul and Corbyin on EU membership - in line with their past anti-capitalist - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents for narcisismul small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sofismului on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant about the fact that JC will not campaign for exit - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should lose Paris or Berlin political capital - and there are voters suspicioși - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed with poor englezilor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a Conservative government that cut costs, as I was reminded at the launch of British Influence Security Forum, on Monday.
Experts criticised the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with links to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the magazine's editorial team British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined solving Lancet in criticising the evidence used by the Department of Public Health England (PHE) in his report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE has published the report "baseline" last month and described him as a "comprehensive analysis of the evidence."
Some researchers have yet to question the robustness of the data and pointed fingers at the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical magazine Lancet attacked "the extraordinarily fragile" who founded the PHE main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in the BMJ have questioned the claims and their base "on solid ground or sand mișcător."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said they expect the PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, one meeting attended by 12 people has led to a model of multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to integrate their views on the negative effects associated with different products containing nicotină; the results of this meeting were shown briefly in a piece of research.
McKee and Capewell or said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director has said that in the past would have received funding from British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.
He also validated the accreditation BAT in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting said the funding received from a manufacturer of electronic cigarettes but not funding that there are reports that we have received from the producer of cigarettes and tobacco company Philip Morris International.
They have not been provided the arguments on which were selected panelului members but among them are a few "leading" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even say in the paper industry funding.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control secției within PHE.
The research paper produced by the group "it whitewashes convincingly" that is "solid evidence on the detrimental effect that it has the majority of the majority of the criteria," said McKee and Capewell.
However, PHE's report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell said PHE claims that "so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health department of the PHE says it has responded to the allegations in the BMJ.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One in two people who had their whole life lose their lives because of this vice.
All the evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic cigarettes for health are minor in comparison, but we must continue to look at the long term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information arising and those that do not arise from the evidence, particularly given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a disease associated with smoking and the annual costs incurred by the national health system from smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Expressing clear current evidence - namely that, although the use of electronic țigărilor is not without its risks, they are only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - our national debt.

Ads that are shame Britain's arms trade
Pursued the film made by Amnesty International against the arms fair.
Terrible ucigașe drones!
The crushing gleznelor Fiare!
Cluster bombs!
And electric batons which causes horrific pain without leaving traces!
Joyful voice and animated images leaves no doubt that the advertising for the biggest global arms fair is a charade - pantomime - fierce, conducted by Amnesty International to highlight the British authorities' desire to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International at the Excel Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also led to the setting of a large number of posters at bus stations and underground systems that need a second look.
"The important announcement, you travel with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" Says one of the announcements, using brandingul fonturile and London subway, DLR line into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will be năpusti on DLR customers are asked to contribute to stopping arms fair.
The 300 posters are made by artists who have exhibited works at the Museum Cruel Designs in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group has contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs," a package of 6 pounds of Allen keys which says "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in the bus stations on the planet."
Directed by transport in London is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of flying.
One of the announcements parody by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Cruel conferențiar Designs and curator at the University of Essex, artists are more and more questions and seek to make political work accessible to the public outside of the galleries.
Many artists are looking to collaborate with activists in protest movements, realising that we need to get out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the trade in arms who encounter navetiștii travelling with Metro.
The film made by Amnesty had more than 100,000 Facebook vizualizări within 24 hours and was created by advertising agency VCCP who worked pro bono, and graphic designer and artist who has doubled the voice also worked for free.
The creation of VCCP, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the advertising for the weapons - with an empty space in the calendar Excel - and thought "Let's give the campaign they are trying to avoid."
They played with a more realistic ads but "îmbogățindu it with animații and strong colours, was more striking."
"They have done a great job helping us to increase interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment in the exhibition," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be a need for the UK authorities to take action and to ensure that the machinery of torture are not illegally sold and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the arms fair comes from within Excel, where the eufemistice expozanții offers fantastic products.
In a press release, Saab has divulged an order received from the US Army on "AT4CS RS with launcher with support on the shoulder."
It includes a "focos with unique form that offers amazing effects behind armurii, inside the target.

Violinist David Grimal: In Bach's era there were no global tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who work, artists and commercial staff.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a solist and as the mastermind of a less rife project, entitled "strange," as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra of international solisti and musicians talentati, simfonic interpreteaza a repertoire without a conductor, and that is to be at least a curiosity in the classic musical landscape.
Les Dissonances was Enescu Festival this year with two performances: A play, on Sunday, where solist was David Grimal, founder of the orchestra, and one on Monday, when the foreground was cellist Xavier Phillips, the works by Enescu as nelipsite.
Both performances, held on the scene Ateneului, showed the public another way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissonances has appeared on the musical scene in 2004 and, at that time, the only classical music ensemble in which there was no conductor.
Conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand musicians need an education or to become solisti, either to become interpreti in an orchestra - speak of instrumentisti and not composers.
I'm specializati formati as "workers."
Professionals have the impression that they need a conductor.
In another part of the scene, to the public, all axeaza fetisizarea musical is the conductor.
And so, businessul, musical industry, is marketing.
Therefore, no longer talking about the music.
So, if we look at the world, we have the skilled workers, which is stupid, and a public who cannot listen, but must priveasca, and it is stupid, "consider David Grimal.
Violinist povesteste that this change in the way that makes the music came from "musical deceptiilor" in his career.
I was like an athlete at the high level that was supposed to make the same May exercise in the whole world with different orchestras, to many money and to make money and the music industry.
After 10 years, when I was around 30 years, I found it very depressing, so that no longer gaseam creativity and Human fraternity in this system.
So, I have never found any sense to continue on this path.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happens in 2004, and at that time no one facea so anything without a conductor: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do fancy to do marketing with a collective of musicians in which there was no ego?" They ask me the artist.
David Grimal recognise that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury," saying that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra does not depend on the success of this project to life.
In 10 years of existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a piedica in the song: "Curiously, as cantam a wider repertoire, with both seems simpler, so that all musicians are obligati be features in the work and not just in the role," sustaining Grimal, adding that at the Sunday "were 74 conductors on the scene."
In the opinion of Grimal, Enescu Festival is "very courageous," just for invited and Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary event, where are the greatest orchestras in the world to sing and 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you have invited and this strange group."
In a temple of traditiei orchestrale, as is Enescu Festival, there is also the place for something different that breaks barriers.
Speaking about the work of Enescu, Romanian violinist recognise that feels the music of the famed Roman composer, so that did not need a special approach when it introduced the Enescu works in the repertoire.
Grimal noteaza as Enescu's music is very instinctiva, but what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "so that there is also a George Enescu, who was French music."
Grimal militeaza to change how they do classical musical educatia, viewing as a "profession of musician, as is being held today, has a flavour of death" and that "the future of music is the music itself."
We do not need to make the world 5 times a year if not serveste to nothing.
In Bach's era there were no global tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who work, who were artists and not commercial staff.
For me, the organisation of the concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albumelor, are all are tremendous, extraordinary, but unless they are in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity is suffering, there is freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave the example of Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before his intrati in EU aveati vegetables and meat."
To enter the EU had to adoptati sanitary laws which are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are in the supermarket, as happens in France.
The same thing happens with music, it is the same logic.
Les Dissonances red is perhaps not too good, but when you are a red taiem.
In a world ideala, should this music to return to the centre and that institutions and industries that gestioneaza this system to understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be impartasita, and this can be done since the educativa.
"If we consider - as do Chol, the Chinese, the Japanese - as Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its invatarea in school, we reintroduce concerts on television and through this education would no longer be required to sell music by," Grimal believes.
Of course, there are things in the classical musical educatia who remain very communist, this everywhere, is something very militarised.
It depends on this discipline if comparam a musician with a soldier, or reintegrate a musician who will sing at an instrument, before all, musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to reintegrate a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want to reintegrate a musician, is something else entirely.
After your parearea, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? "They ask me the French artist zambind.
Grimal suggest, for artists, the reward of a different kind of music comes precisely from overcoming this status of "soldier," overcoming what "they believe are their limits": "Musicians are discovering at some point that there are soldiers, and that is why after the concert go zambitori."
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and about his music and the artist in the "Festival of ideas," a discussion with the audience held at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Institute Romania.

FedEx gains are mixed, fall fiscal projections for 2016
FedEx said the disappointing results for the last quarter, the giant in the field of supplies by reducing profit estimates for the year as a result of lower demand for transport services and increased costs for its division of land transport.
The company also said that it intends to hire around 55.000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares have fallen by around 2.5% in pre-market trading, with 45 minutes before the sound clopoțelului opening Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10,40 and 10,90 dollars for the fiscal year that ends in May of next year, with 20 cents less, according to a previous estimates.
Analysts had predicted the figure of 10,84 dollars, according to a survey by FactSet.
The fall comes despite rising prices by 4.9% on average, with the entry into force on January 4th and higher suprataxele for land transport of large packages or with great weight, which will apply in November.
The company said it still expects to increase the gains from the previous year as a result of the reduction in costs, higher incomes and the development of online trade.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that "the company is facing an economic situation considerably weaker than expected, particularly in terms of production and global trade."
Employment during the holiday plans were announced a day after a competitor UPS said it intends to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number of employees that we did last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx won 692 million dollars, with 6% more than the previous year.
Gains in action were 2,42 dollars, below the average estimate of $2,44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit rose by 5% to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analysts who participated in the survey conducted by Zacks called for the 12,23 billion dollars.
The company FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, which led to the stagnation of income recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping săltat FedEx Ground division results.
In the last quarter, Ground division revenues rose by 29% but operational revenues have virtually stalled because of higher costs for large packages and their own insurance.
Express unit posted an increase in revenue because of higher tariffs, while revenues from the Freight fell due to rising costs.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening FedEx scăzuseră actions with 3.85 dollars or 2.5%, to $150,15.
On Tuesday at the closing scăzuseră 11% on a year and 17% from the record peak recorded on 11 June.
The most anticipated meetings in recent years, with policy makers at the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a table of Honduran mahon with 27 feet to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the room for the meeting of the central bank, will discern a mural of the United States.
The map is designed to recall that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all.
The Central Bank received a dual task from Congress: To maximise the rate of employment in the US and to maintain price stability.
But since the economic crisis, the Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: Financial stability.
And this third task could be the X factor in a decision too difficult to predict which will be announced on Tuesday, and that will determine whether the US economy is ready to be dezbărată of unprecedented stimulus provided by the short term interest rates near zero in force since the end of 2008.
Even if the majority of the data indicates a growing economy strong, the recent disturbances in the global financial markets could frighten the Fed already cautious about adding volatility by increasing the benchmark federal funds rate - even just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and the main issues that will follow them," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerages Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, rising uncertainty in the global market is enough to give them arguments to wait," she said.
There is no consensus regarding the decision that will take the Fed, this in itself causing instability in the financial market.
About half of the economists chestionați recently by Bloomberg predicted a rise in interest rates this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases interest rates, except where those who forge policies would alleviate the promising that it would be a long time until the next growth.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.599,85.
The momentum was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will keep interest rates stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising that the Fed to raise interest rates at this time," Lonski said.
If the Fed decision makers would do this, "should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets."
Other experts have said that a rise in interest rates would calm financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just one month ago else, the Fed appeared to be on track to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer they expect a rise in interest rates this year despite the objections raised by liberals as that would need more economic progress.
Although job creation has slowed in August, the labour market growth has been strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and nearly the level considered by the Fed as full employment.
Wage gains have presented signs of growth.
And although inflation has continued to reach the annual goal of the central bank, the Fed decision makers have said that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil price slump.
The economy "can withstand higher rates and needs them, given the tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the global financial markets began to enter fibrilații at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones industrial average fell by 16 per cent below the record peak reached in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy will drag down global growth.
The market has reculat somewhat this month, the Dow is now about 10% below the peak in May.
For the Fed decision makers, agitation on the market is added to the complex calculation of the timing of interest rate.
"Without what happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be strongest in the sitting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a researcher with experience in the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now, he expected to wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and almost no data on which to base following the events in China," said Oliner.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so basically should not be taken into account in making decisions.
But, in reality else, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence was huge.
The mere hint of the then chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Fed could "decrease" monetary expansion triggered the earthquake on global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are twinned more and more, it is expected that Fed officials not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, It will., said this month that "the Fed has a history of bloated response to changes in the financial market that seem to have no connection with the economic foundations."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Commission on the open market, with the role of the decision, which upheld the interest rate rises, gave as an example the 1998-99.
A financial crisis that has hit Asia prompted the Fed to cut the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the possibility of identification with limited implications for the development of the US," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials have returned on the respective scăderilor.
EDF should put the issue of financial stability in the first place only in the event of a major crisis, as was the earthquake on the market in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the committee to set interest rates from the Bank of England.
The last turbulent period is nowhere near the level, he said.
"Certainly we do not want to get into the situation of being afraid of a rise in interest rates because they were upset the markets," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve still holds dual mandate and did not mention the financial stability and, until will change anything in this regard, I do not think we should take action prematurely.

Four people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a băiețel age 4, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at the mob who demonstrate against the proposed new constitution of the country, an official said Wednesday.
The violence happened on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal's statements, the district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a secții police, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said that police forces have used tear gas and fired shots in the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, were injured two police officers and five civilians.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which they know that they can kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group says the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal, where the ethnic Tharus group wants its own state.

Usable reduction surgery could be useful in the case of easy diabeticilor with obesity
The benefits of reducing chirurgiei usable for people with mild obesity, type 2 diabetes zaharat could keep for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabeticii with mild obesity live longer after surgical intervention by the weight loss than those who are nechirurgicale treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralise data on mortality," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, chariot she wrote an article about the new study in the Lukina Surgery.
Operations for the weight loss, called and bariatrică surgery, using various methods to micșora bellies.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limits the ability of the body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatrică surgery has proved effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes zaharat, but most studies have been conducted on people with obesity morbidă, with a body mass index (IMC) 35 or higher.
IMC, a measure of usable in relation to the job, is considered normal in the range of 18.5 to 24.9.
The IMC at least 25 indicates that a person are overweight and people with IMC over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate the IMC accesând: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Hospital General Min-Sheng in Taiwan have used data collected in 2007 in a trial in which compares two types of bariatrică - gastric bypass surgery and gastrectomie manșon - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes zaharat in people with mild obesity.
IMC environment for people who have undergone surgical intervention has dropped from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year as part of the study.
Meanwhile, the IMC in people who have received treatment against diabetes nechirurgicale zaharat remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
Of those who have undergone surgical intervention, diabetes zaharat was cured completely at 36% and partly to 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes zaharat was cured completely at just 1% and partly to just 2% of subjects.
In addition, the control tension arteriale, trigliceridele and LDL "bad" cholesterol "were generally better in the surgery group," concluded the authors.
The researchers also monitored the level of sanguin hemoglobinei A1c, which reflects the glicemiei over time.
The researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobinei A1c is below 7%.
After the surgical intervention, the average level of hemoglobinei A1c fell from around 9% to around 6%.
But in the group treated by medical methods, has been maintained at around 8%.
But this improved glicemic "control" - reflected in improved levels of A1c hemoglobinei - have not reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to the head researcher Dr. Chih Cheng HSU and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
In the fifth year, compared with the group with the manșon gastrectomie, with surgical intervention to bypass group lost more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), had more significant drops in the value of the IMC (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobinei A1c (3.1% from 2.1%) and showed a higher probability of full diabetes remisiune zaharat (46.9% from 16.7%).
Although the new study does not show a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on people with high weight in Sweden that surgical intervention prolongs life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who have undergone surgical intervention bariatrică presented a probability of around 29% lower to die after 15 years, compared with a group that has tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients who have undergone surgical intervention, Blackstone said it is something positive for people with IMC under 35 interested.
"This is the point at which this work is critical, because it says that this surgical intervention is safe in the group with low IMC," without increasing the risk of death or illness renală, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking weight seriously -să IMC's patient reaches 27 to 30.
"I think we expect too much to urge people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have scurtcircuitat bodies predispunându them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has sent a call to end the violence in the mother countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in the speech he made at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for compassion in Oxford, dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his visit for 10 days in Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should take precedence over the interests of individual nations and even of every continent.
He also stressed that, while admirable, the countries of western Europe's response to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama has praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It's wonderful care for the thousands of refugees, but we need to look at the same time in the long term solutions to bring genuine peace and development, particularly through education, in Muslim countries," he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
Need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems, "he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented about the actions of George Bush after the terrorist attacks on September 11, saying that the violent response from the US has sparked a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 11 September, we sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and I told him to solve this problem without having to resort to violence.
I know that his motives were strong but used force and led to unexpected consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.

Why are witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Later today, with the exception of a belated legal intervention, I will look like a man condemned to death.
If it happens, and I hope that does not happen, I will sit in a room for observers in the execution of the Oklahoma state prison and I will see how Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection administration.
He asked me to be one of the four witnesses officials at his death.
The first came in January, through the best friend of his, and, although I was shocked, I accepted.
As we get closer to the day, I am îngrozește idea.
So, why should do?
I agreed because I thought it is a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
Would provide a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because usually the demands exceed the number of seats available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
Those elected will watch the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to his closest friends of Richard Glossip, furthermore I developed my own relationship with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two hours half.
I like the type.
Often laugh when we talk.
Prison authorities say they cannot be and witness and journalist, so I will be allowed to have at me a carnețel and a pix to record what I see.
Will have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter that I compromise the impartiality.
That is the lesson.
Deținutului tells the story as he wants, get access.
I complained about it.
He acknowledged that it could "make better," but is still think are wrong.
Richard Glossip did not agree with some of the things that I said and I have written.
Don't tell me what to write and I would not do it even if I would ask.
I told him that I can remove from the list of witnesses.
But wants to be an international report that to write about the subject.
Believes that, if he dies, it will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to find out more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that I have done.
I will not come back here on all the details.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it is very likely to be guilty of murder.
I strongly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think that his execution is wrong.
And I will watch him dying from this perspective.
I cannot pretend that I am totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
You will hear from me as it is to watch a man that I like dying unnecessarily.
Peter Moody claims stewarzii tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw from the race
Peter Moody said Racing Victoria stewarzii or tried to infiltrate a spy in its grajdurile last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack against stewarzilor and Racing Victoria's integrity department, saying they conducted a personal campaign against him, the straw that broke the camel's back as Lady Tatai elimination from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the races and that is placed in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome of the test for Lidari's cobalt, which has no explanation.
For 18 months and has înghițit words on statements about spies and did not want to resemble "sly, which does not reach the grapes."
"I was not going to say anything about the issue and we have taken a long time but sometimes reach a level of frustration so high that everything suddenly răbufnește," Moody said.
It is known that has continued.
Sometimes reacționezi and must bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I will go home and I will sleep happy.
I want to go with our heads held high and I wish the owners with whom I work to see that I strive to give them all the best.
From the moment they start to believe that is not the case, we need to give up the job of trainer.
At that time I will have to think what I will do with my certification.
Previously, Moody threw the bomb in an interview given to the racing.com said the integrity department has tried to spy on them grajdurile.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart was standing in a room with a man - whose name I will tell him if I am asked - and offered to hire him at my grajdurile to provide information about the work there," Moody said on Racing.com.
Obviously I think a trișor.
If so, then we should give their all because they were incompetenți resignation in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of the RVL, David Moodie, the current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, Executive Director of the current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and I know and today.
Should I think it is something personal?
It is necessary that RVL to begin to have backbone and can hold accountable people outside trainerilor for what is happening in the industry?
I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Perhaps just see the others.
Perhaps I must take licența and give me a hand and I have no doubts that the statements that I make now could lead to think about this option.
However, we have reached the point where I do not care and that I am saddened.
I am very saddened.
I will put pressure on and I will get them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can go.
Trainerului frustration has grown with the long probe on testing for cobalt to Lidari was involved and eliminating led him to speculate that it could implement its licența "on the table."
Moody, whose name is most often associated with training Campionului undefeated Black Caviar, has labelled the treatment on the day of the race as "ridiculous" after it was applied on the feet of horses a stopgap with nămol or argilă, which violates the rules.
Violating the rules of flight.
Must I take full responsibility for this, "he says.
One of my employees put in nămol mistake on the leg.
It could happen last night.
It could have happened yesterday, what did.
Happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment of race in the application cataplasmei, for which stewarzii opened an investigation.
It is a joke.
The people who make these rules do not know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules but it has gone too far," said Moody.

Melbourne Storm coach, Craig Bellamy, they respond to opponents accusations of wrestling.
Melbourne Storm coach, Craig Bellamy, called placare criticism of the tactics used by his team as "distorted" issues raised by the two frontrunners in the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach, Trent Robinson, said that referees have allowed the Storm players to "take them to grips" team in the game made nervous by the Storm in the final qualifying match on Friday evening in Sydney.
The coach of the Brisbane Broncos, time Bennett, made a slight reference to the Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match with the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening, when he called the game a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland teams are not too are in wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defending the tactics of placare addressed his team and said that the players simply concentrating on the "contact" when placau.
Bellamy said he gained confidence after two major coaches have criticised the team, which means that they were worried that the Storm will prevail.
"And it doesn't stop there - I heard Trent Robinson to complain about wrestling when we were beaten with the score 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that I have not changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so that in the last six weeks we have really focused on contact in placări and so I have changed the situation.
Trent has been in office for three years and obviously has a great team so that probably is not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
Nostim as always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy has contradicted Bennett's idea of "football" Anima, reminding his mentorului St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett's won the championship in 2010 playing football "boring."
Time talking about football thrilling.
He argued opinion comparing their game Saturday evening with our game on Friday evening and spoke about how thrilling was the game, "Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George has received a lot of criticism because it was a boring team and time said they are not interested in either as black under unghie.
But now has a team that can play what I regard as thrilling football, especially because of the young mijlocașilor quick.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He made this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two mijlocași as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to do so.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat worried about the match with us.
Six weeks ago probably not thought to us when they were in the big matches.
Bellamy has also highlighted the fact that the match between the Storm and Roosters was a more fierce competition to score compared to the game between the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I have not yet seen, as was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game have been two attempts, that means suspenseful game?
Or thrilling means to do breaks and not marchezi?
Are plans for me.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet.
Storm is free this weekend because they have earned the right to play at home or with the North Queensland Cowboys and the Cronulla Sharks in the final preliminariilor by next Saturday at AAMI Park, and tickets are on sale next Tuesday, the morning.

FriendsFest: The series of comedy that has learned important lessons about the friendship between men
The absence of similar personajelor in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the peak of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicidul was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 years in Britain, and is three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign against unfortunate life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (calm) has designated 2015 as the Year of men, seeking to question the culture that prevents men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight for the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted on more than 2,000 high school students who showed symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by so many friends "with healthy provision," his chances of recovery doubles.
Similarly, for people who are not deprimate, a circle of friends mentally healthy halving the likelihood of emerging mental disorders.
Of course, for the friendship to take effect, it must first be accessible.
In this age of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is on style and not on the substance, the immediate response is often a priority before contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create buy us the pretence of a strong personalities, open to distracție and successful, even if in reality it is the isolation that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinseci values; money, image, social status, all with the intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - and more deeply affecting our mental health.
Aul billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money does not buy happiness.
The beauty of the series Friends was that focused attention on this idea.
The characters were not defined by their jobs but their own personality, which showed by interacționarea as friends.
Frequent îmbrățișărilor humor of Joey and Chandler, when watching football in the cosy seats and Ross's passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can be associated with this situation, even if often are willing to fully explore their feelings.
As I explained a social worker: "... my role to listen to people with suicidal tendency and deprimate showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who come to us do not feel able to talk with friends.
The old adage to descurci alone is strong, like the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that come to mind when I try to give more psychological adjustment mechanisms in the long term.
The series has highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps the objective, outside, via telephone, people watching in times of despair, long term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you participate in this weekend at the Central FriendsFest organised by comedy acts, with restoring full platourilor film to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends over coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smiling at me and something.
You never know what difference could make your friendship.
Friends is aired by the Central comedy acts from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - on # FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG to Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he scored against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG to impose on the Swedish team Malmo.
I present cronica match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have done its job, Paris Saint-Germain from the matches in the Champions League groups, with a reassuring 2-0 victory against Malmo in the match played on Tuesday in the Park des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes after the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the champions of France on edge although they missed a number of occasions before securing the advantage with Cavani's goal he scored in the 61st minute.
Ending in Group A along with Real Madrid and Șahtior Donețk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the French team is not only qualification to next round but also an improvement of the journey towards the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
But, although they have taken the points, students Laurent Blanc was far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity gap after which was replaced by the team in his home city and the club and began a brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so the victory with 2-0 it creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable gap over the next clasați, even if there are issues that we need to refine them throughout the season," said Blanc.
It is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I am sorry that we failed to give one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic has recovered after injuring one of three changes to the team in Paris, with a 2-2 station obtained at home to Bordeaux in the League 1 over the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month, when he was transferred from Manchester United, Argentine mijlocașul offensive was named the man who will lead PSG at the next level in Europe and has demonstrated this when he țâșnit at Marco Verratti's pass behind the defence of Malmo before șuteze incredible over Johan Wiland, porții colțul term on the right.
But if you expect someone like PSG to get pocnind victory in their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play off to get to this stage and entered the field with nine holders at national teams, with a defence of five people and two mijlocași defensivi, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, the exception being șutul of Nikola Djurdjic who passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players have slowed several times, giving some unnecessary passes and nefinalizând interventions, even Ibrahimovic who has missed no fewer than five attempts in the first half and was replaced by Cavani then even after the resumption of the game.
Ibrahimovic has proved far more skillful in support of his colleagues, his pass was the one that Di Maria sent in a șut skewed by Wiland over in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after escaping an hour of the game, thanks to Cavani, uruguayanul who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's centrarea.
This goal has removed the hope of those in Malmo that will reechilibra score and only a superb Wiland's clock from a distance for rejecting David Luiz has kept the final score before new intratului Ezequiel Lavezzi to cancel a goal in stoppage time.
The Norwegian coach of the team in Malmo, Age Hareide said later that PSG were a class above and that "The game we have played in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, I have only played in the league in Sweden, which is not at the same level.
The qualifications are not enough.
Hats off to PSG.
Made an excellent game.

How we closed Hagi contestatarilor mouth
Considered by the way the world's largest Roman footballer in history, stake Hagi was labelled, after withdrawing from the activity, as a poor coach, who may not be able to achieve effective and in the new position.
After the unfortunate experiente in the national team, the Star or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, after a year, the coach at the Future of Constanta, the team patroneaza.
Fixed after a year after taking over the team, he has demonstrated that it is able to transform a team that zbatea to save from relegation into one of the top.
So, after a year, the Future of recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 infrangeri remize and 11.
Bilantul is one of the top teams, which is the European cups.
Things took a willing and better for the Future of this season, as the team came in second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in the League 1, with 20 goals (on par with Astra), more than double than Star.

In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It's a strategy to legitimise, but after that one can ask to be treated as the saptea country of the EU.
Big countries come up with solutions for the EU, said Cristian Ghinea, a member of the Roman College, director of the Centre for European Policy.
In an interview Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea said that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the police simply will not continuing in this crisis: "Can we have doubts as to the quality of the values with which these people are coming."
But there are masses who have started and we cannot return to history.
Migration is a reality that must be adaptam as well and to adaptam on them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Ghinea, we were in a very emotional moment, in which politicians feel the need to show their muschii.
After he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen space must be changed: "Schengen is now as an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to the situation now."
Where we are in the refugee crisis after the JHA council which, in fact, has not solved anything?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All the forecast for saying that they had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, JHA is applying the principle unanimitatii and any state can block any decision.
Therefore, things were very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, apply normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, and the council approved by a vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, which represent 65% of the EU population.
Calculations were saying that the votes were there.
But did not want to go ahead.
If it's a sensitive issue, even reactii rejection occurred in Germany against the policy of opening of Chancellor Merkel and did not want as many countries as a reaction to the EU "we send migranti per."
They postponed final so, but the problem remains that, obviously, this wave creeaza a key issue for Schengen guvernanta and we are likely to see big changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas were not really removed, but the topic was just left to more raceasca?
Yes, on the other hand, institutions speaks about the greater involvement of the Frontex agency's in the management of external borders, which makes a change from the individual responsibility of members who are at the external borders of the Schengen to the responsibility of the international community.
Greece's border with Turkey and Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migranti gave the Schengen system.
It will be under the Dublin that migrantii are the responsibility of the state in which enter the first time, so that is not sustainable.
If Greece capoteaza, You say forever as it is the job of Greece.
The problem is common.
Precisely so that the problem is common, it is possible a resolution without a precise mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, the burden of the reception?
Nobody know exactly how they will continue operating mandatory quotas, if it comes to them.
That remains a question: What do you do with a man who does not want to come in Romania or in Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I do not think that will be up to European states to take on the top migrantii: You go in country X or Y. country
Likely will reach niste single screening centres, in Greece or Turkey, where to process asylum applications.
It works on solutions like this.
But the problem is not a simple solution.
There are countries who have decades of experience in trying to integrate migranti, are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the migrantilor will increase the xenophobic.
The fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who sit in precarious camps and just started to go to Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% have got to go, it's hard to winter over the Mediterranean, but are next year in a wave can even higher.
What do we do with people they?
My Pronosticul is that we obisnui with this issue, we will not look so catastrophic in terms of media.
Vorbeati countries with less experience or higher.
Do you find that there is no place where he really managed the integration of large groups coming from a culture extraeuropeana?
I look at magrebieni in France, Turks in Germany, they are all enclavizati.
I would not go to the radical statements.
Sure that their integration is more difficult than with other waves of Migration, but that does not mean that there is no integreaza.
Left some creeaza neintegrata that major social problems in France, in Germany, in Britain.
But just means politiensti will continue operating.
To creating the fortress Europe is illusory.
We have fiddled with the mechanisms of integration into European societies.
Have been niste greseli.
We need to be more pretentiosi.
To ask those people to learn to drive the language, to try to take the values, it no longer stay with one foot in Europe and one in their home country, bringing the rest of the family including weddings by convenienta.
Must be separated but the impending of these people for the long term of their integration.
If others have failed in the long term integration does not mean that we need to look at them as ineaca in the Mediterranean.
We have doubts as to the quality of the values that come with those people.
And if an intervention in Syria, which I do not believe, does not mean that it will restore the country overnight and ii You go back.
Up to solutions, we see bulwark within Europe.
Granite has been closed, walls, reintroduc border controls within the Schengen space.
Is the European project in jeopardy?
The European project as such, the Schengen space as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and aranjand rules so that the pressure was too much on the countries in which they set foot for the first time those migranti.
I.e. new circulam freely there, but each is with his problems.
In front of such a wave cannot be so, so that some countries are not.
When there are such waves of emotie, politicians want to show that I do something, but in the long term does not change much.
After the attacks in France does not have a more draconica antiterorista legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotiei instaleaza in both ways.
And it is so instabila from one week to the next that one can make decisions based on them.
We have more vorbarie, many employing statements from politicians line home under pressure to be virili.
And, then, of the child's dramatic inecat in Turkey and public opinion is emotioneaza.
After passing emotia publish, we head to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement which is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real European market.
And I do not believe that the Europeans are under this principle of libertatatii of movement.
As there will be other rules is something else.
Schengen is now as an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to the situation now.
Romania has played so far in this crisis?
As a small country, who believes that if sapca draw the eye and plug its ears, the theme disappears.
In front of the wave realitatii migranti, You choose to be part of the solution or to regulating that is not your problem in the country.
That is what we have done, it's a strategy to legitimise, but after that one can ask to be treated as the saptea country of the EU.
Not Esti, not playing at the level of the country.
Big countries come up with solutions for the entire EU, good or bad, there were now their quality.
SAA as was Poland.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite for Schengen romanilor will drop very much.
President Iohannis says that it is good that we have not already entered.
So we move from despair threshold to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen as his migrantii we see that the alternative route.
What does not mean that there is a reason to stop any Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of the Schengen, but Schengen will exist, but turned towards where the external borders will become common responsibility, will be the unique rules for accepting migrantilor, single deportation rules for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries deemed safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia has shifted attention on Syria in Ukraine has never killed anyone.
There is a connection between the two sites, a game of Russia?
Russia has a behaviour power frustrata.
She believes that to be the great power means to incurci Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without financial and military effort of the Putin regime, likely that the Assad regime would have crumbled long ago.
And it was good to prabuseasca before the main or his opponent or Islamic State.
A couple of years was a struggle between the Assad regime and the secular and moderate Muslim militiile, strenuous by Western and Gulf countries.
Then the Islamic State and now no longer know if we want the Assad regime to manner.
Russia was able to complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
She creeaza outbreaks of instability and chaos that it cannot shut.
But Esti great power only if you and solutions.
The game off-Side is just a strategy to gain time.
Likely that Putin expects him to make bids, to press him on butoane to resolve the situation.
Bids do not come because the world is not convinced that he can solve in one way or another he also created issues.
But I do not agree with the theories that say that those people are a class manati invizibila.
To not see Putin more powerful than it is.
What a button to as soon
Millions of Facebook users have been rife with the "Like" button, and now the social network representatives pregatesc another opposed, "Dislike."
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be available soon, reports the New York Times blog.
Zuckerberg said the button "Dislike" will show rather a nuanta what feels a user than a mere optiune.
However, the announcement or raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg has noted that he wants to avoid the times when someone posteaza on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike."
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have asked for more time to consider the opportunity to express their negative emotiile or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg said that it is not very comfortable for people to "Like" of current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable to give Like that postari," noted the Facebook.
The option of a new Facebook button was not placed well for everyone.
"There are already destula hatred on Facebook and than sites," commented Atiq Haneef in Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where he was posted with this article.
"I'll give 'Dislike' butonului 'Dislike'," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiolog in Atlanta, argued that there is nothing in the irregularity with this button, encouraging people to have different views on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer company, has noted that it is hard to imagine that a single button can send a complex range of negative emotii.
Moreover, she claims, is approaching election campaign in America, and button "Dislike" would create a total disaster.

Adventures in the stone age
In the opinion of the FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handbalistică competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the national women's handball for qualification for the Olympics cost a fortune.
Romanian Handball Federation President, Alexander Dedu, said yesterday during a meeting with the media, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
In terms of national women's handball team of Romania, "the main objective is qualification for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for that must pass two stages of furci gauntlet, the first World Championship and secondly the prequalification," said Dedu.
We want very much to qualify for the Olympic Games.
There are some fantastic requirements from technical stafului led by Tomas Ryde.
Staf which will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, a doctor, two masori, coach-keepers, preparator physically, Head of Delegation.
We have sought to obtain qualifications some things, specifically materials for physical training, which I have never heard.
This all to reach the Olimpice. and I will do whatever it takes for me to take.
This is a massive investment, there are many, many money.
But this is the way to make performance.
Because at the moment we are in the stone age with the preparation.
"The teams that we have these materials, and have for some time," said Dedu, who said that trying to get the money needed to purchase these products from the plan and COSR.
The FRH referred to and infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country to host a major handball competition.
We do not have room in Bucharest.
It is a matter of infrastructure and it is shameful to be questioned a European Championship gym.
Let us not forget that in other corners of the world Olympic neighbourhoods have been built entirely in a span of two years.
Before 1992, the Barcelona Olympic area was a dump, and now has reached a milestone of beauty.
As was the case in London, where the 2012 Olympics was a success and in terms of investment.
"In my view, in 2024 can host a major competition," said Dedu.
He added that the international handball bodies are willing to give Romania a major disadvantage.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions in Romania.
Mr civilised Gațu went with a project, people have given the agreement in principle, but have been clarified very quickly that it will never build the hall.
I also had discussions with the EHF, we have said that we want, that we are able to organise and they say that I agree, and to invite them to the first game in the new hall in Bucharest and then discuss concrete.
"So we are all opening, and the EHF and the IHF, but we do not have the infrastructure," explained the official FRH.
The former great handball player has avoided to assess the chances of female teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I asked for all coaches to be rezervați in their forecasts, that if it is not turn against them."

Iașul, made fools of RATP controllers and a pliant.
A tourist Pățania
A family of tourists in Cluj in Iași has come to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After traita experience neither I nor my wife does not want to more calcam vreodata in your town.
Without wanting to, have been hit by the erroneous information in leaflets, RAPT nesimțirea controllers, and bonus, a fine "that the so called the law."
Husbands Iași arrived in a few days ago, were cazat in a hotel in the Centre and demanded tourist leaflets.
They have received and a pliant were past RATP routes.
"Armed" with these maps, husbands visited Iașul.
But, two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to reach Palas Mall.
Because it was not hold with tickets in stația near Copou Park, they have relied on the information printed on pliant: They can take the ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in pliant, they climbed into a bus and tried to send SMS following instructions on the pliant.
Unfortunately for them, and made up a team of controllers RATP.
They said that there was no service for 2 years and that was announced in the press that has been cancelled.
I DE where SA I know roughly what was written in the local media, I'm coming with a night before his visit the city?
I spoke with the controllers, I explained the situation, they said that did not care about, it's not their job.
The attitude was very sfidatoare.
They say that all we can do is to make a single fine deie instead of 2 (me and wife).
"I paid, I did not want to break up the imi visited booth at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!" Povestește Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of erroneous information from pliant and controllers who have applied the law to the "blood."
It is not fair, and I made a complaint to the RATP Iasi to recover the money.
It's not about the money, I am not overly many, but the idea is that I also felt inselat.
Ghinion for rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in custody
The trial of seven rapists in Vaslui moved, yesterday, at the Court of Appeal Iași.
Magistrates ieșeni tried the first time trial in a nepublică session in which the seven young men accused of batjocorit a young 18 years have asked to be set at liberty.
Before the start of the trial, one of the judges ieșeni whom I had been assigned the file, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was accepted by his colleagues on the court.
Magistrate served until the summer of this year at the Vaslui, where he was President Secției On ­ nale, he is the one who, on 9 April, acknowledged a dispute made four of inculpați, placing them under house arrest.
Currently, the case is being tried by a completely which includes magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Earlier, in the dossier has formulated an abstention and Judge Dan Year ­ tone, on the grounds that his daughter is in a relationship outside of wedlock with one of the lawyers of rapists.
The two judges decided that the rapists in Vaslui to remain in custody.
TI ­ nerii will remain incarcerated for at least another 30 days, when Jude ­ cătorii are bringing back the possibility of their freedom.
All ­ torul long trial will be conducted at the Court of Appeal Iași on 6 October.
Before arriving at the Court of Appeal Iași, duba which were transported rapists in Vaslui was involved in an accident in the Păcurari, car enters Iași on the belt.
Autoutilitara Iveco with which were transported the seven rapists struck a car Volks ­ wagen that ieșise on stradela sing and șoferul tried to vireze left.
Păcurari Duba move from the end.
She entered the Iași here because employees of Penitentiaries preferred route from Vaslui to Iași in the stables, then Șoseaua belt.
They have shortened the way with a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, escort arestaților called another transport to take prisoners.
Shortly, at the crash site was sent a car from Rahova maximum Iași Safety, who took the seven prisoners and transported him to the Court of Appeal.

"The incident was not reported by the police, because the drivers do car ­ uă amicable have been understood in terms of damage that must be paid," said Commissioner Mădălin Țăranu Head, from the IPJ.
Migrations, the
Romania is not and will not be ready for what happens next.
But Europe?
I say at the outset, loud and clear: Those even 7,000 refugees who should and must naturalise Romania is, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the proposed voluntary quota of Bucharest, in the amount of around 1,500 occupants, it goes far beyond the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will even accept to settle in our locations, opportunities to integrate quickly in Romanian society are extraordinarily low.
I am convinced that they will be the first to lose their patience.
Parazitat by mobsters and paralysed by a political class venală, the Romanian state is impotent in all areas.
Failure to integrate the Roma is just a trivial example.
In addition to this, the governments of any colour have not been able to absorb European funds, to make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, to ensure a decent healthcare, to collect the mess on the street, create jobs paid a respectable or to keep their own younger generation at home.
Why would establish the refugees in another country in which it runs?
But what is more surprising is particularly the hypocrisy with which it dealt with such a crisis.
We have first fățărnicia belicoasă of strong EU states, which are showing the utmost generosity when it comes to share troubles with smaller countries.
It then fricoasă hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives lying about everywhere in the world, it is still on the other - a different language, different religion, different blood.
Probably afraid not to steal careva national life.
In the end, there is a hypocrisy of many migrants who, although only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for the departure, do not accept another destination of the brain than Germany or the Nordic countries.
However, not all of the refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan is not war.
Also, the simplistic way in which it is considered the crisis can only be mocked.
We need to eliminate the causes, some support, and hinting strictly on the book of political correctness, for peace and investment for the migrants' countries of origin.
But in Romania is peace and even more come from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians to leave their country every year.
Why leave?
In this crisis, the European Union we have been revealed as a construction anchilozată, disunited and overcome the situation.
Deplângeam that Romania is not able to invent a project for the country, but this is that neither the EU does not have any plans for the future.
And improvizațiile and threats do not help anything.
Then, what is using the EU, if the only advantage enjoyed by the Romanians - the right to free movement - could be put into question because of the wave of refugees who cross borders as with cheese?
At one point, the war in Syria will end.
And the migrants, however.
In the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and particularly in Africa, for a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not, nor will ever be pregatită for what will follow.

Exclusive: A meeting that breaks your heart.
In 20 years received a brave but: Biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear circumstances, in the dark days of the 1990s, when he was just two months of life, small bolnăvioară and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same year in which the adoption was loosely regulated, a young ieșeancă, now a girl blondă and beautiful, reunited day in Iași with biological parents in a village of județului, after nearly two decades in which nobody has known nothing else.
Crina will be 20 years these days, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to give their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: A visit to Romania, Iași, to know the past unclear.
"Iași" newspaper, who assisted in the search of the family home after some extremely vague indications, was witness to these meetings which basically breaking your heart.
Coverage reporters, emotions moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are downright mișcătoare and awesome.
Crinei story starts 20 years ago in the ieșeană Ruginoasa, when he was only two months.
Then, because of health problems, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital in the city.
Home began to be disagreements between parents, and the mother was forced to părărească residence.
He decided to keep the girl, and me to send me home.
He stopped the girl, and then I have never known anything.
"When I found out I was in the hospital, it was too late," remembers îndurerată Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pașcani and also when the girl's father, Costică Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County Council.
Their lives had to break definitively.
There were also found on Crina at hospital
After internare, Crinei father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iași, and father, when he returned, had never found it.
I think trecuseră nearly nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"We have thought that it is abandoned," a nepoată povestește family.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother was not able to come up with Crina in Iași, and the girl was left in the care of doctors.
Because no one was more interested in the fate of the child in all this time, it was assumed by the Directorate General of Social and Child Protection Asistență Iași, who then gave it to the care of the Bucium Plasament Centre.
There were years in which abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated from today in Romania.
The Bucium was found by Italy's Salvadore and his wife, a couple of Palermo who wanted to have their child but not reușea.
They love the place of blonduța Crina, and after some time it had to move permanently with them in Italy.
Small previously had already nearly two years, how long they lasted the formalities of adoption.
When I saw the Crina, I felt that it's our girl.
"As my wife would have given him life," says smiling Salvadore, the adoptive father, while gains in the palm of the hand of the girl's flimsy.
In the country, parents Crinei, Alina and Costică, continued separate searches, each wherever possible.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where could be his child.
The police then told him that it may be decedată, but to Iași parents have learned what really happened with their girl.
When I looked here, they told me at the tribunal that plecată in Italy in Palermo.
And the conditions to a point I have never had.
We have asked God to be good.
I thought of it in all the years that have passed, but there were opportunities to umblăm, to find it.
"It's hard," povestește us with tears in their eyes Crinei's biological mother.
However, even if the years have passed, the parents of Ruginoasa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and wife have explained the girl's where it comes from, and that its past connects it to Romania.
I was a little when I heard.
I think we had five or six years.
I reacted as a copilă, I was curious.
"I wanted to know my parents in Romania," testifies delighted Crina.
And her dream was to become a reality.
In March of this year, Commissioner Head Romică Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Disease Prevention, Assessment and Counseling Drug Enforcement Iași, was contacted by a note from Italy, who explained Salvadore's desire to find biological family of Crinei.
And the searches started only from a name.
After the call that we had from our partners in Italy, I started the first steps.
Primisem only a name, Balcan Costică, then the locality, Ruginoasa.
Soon I had a job with the mayor there, and I was able to ask if there is the local name given.
Then gave me some indications, only that the person was not found and sought.
"Ultimately lasted about a month ago to find him on the girl's biological father," explains the head Romică Ichim.
In total, more than three months have taken the authorities to find the Costică and Alina, especially that each was living in another locality.
We have commenced work somewhere in March, and in the months of June and July we completed the identification of biological parents and the discussions.
"Then we established that in September to hold a first meeting," added Romică Ichim.
Over the past weekend, Alina and Costică and saw for the first time the girl lost in the hospital holurile Iași, 20 years ago.
The father, moved, barely able to contain their tears, and hands tremurau them tirelessly.
Just change a few words with those around them.
A week before the meeting hardly be able to sleep.
It was also moved, tremura.
"To see your child after so many years, it is something," says a nepoată, and she with Costică from Ruginoasa.
Crinei meeting with his mother and brother of biological
In discussions with his girl, who is going to study at a university well rated in Italy, Costică Balcan told him, among other things, that if one wants to return to his village, to be quiet: I can give some sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and to put together a household.
The mother is also emotion, cry, and hardly believes that something like this can happen to them.
I am very emotion.
I thought that something like this can happen.
I have seen such cases on television, I thought all these years, I hoped, but I thought I could be myself.
Are very high emotions.
If I could forgive me.
I hope to visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a legatură," tells us with big tears on obraji Alina, mother Crinei, while keeping close to hand a șervețel.
He is still in hiding tears of happiness, because shortly will be seen with her girl after such a bitter time.
On the other side, Crina, who will be more than just a few days ago, this month, 20 years, trying to reassure a child emotional as well.
Do not know what to expect, but has schițat a vague idea about her biological parents.
Think I am young, but now before the meeting is trying to gather their thoughts, because it has a lot to say, but nothing reproșat.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are ultimately the ones who have grown.
It will be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina testifies.
The first meeting of the family in Iași
In Unirii Square, in the beginning of the autumn, the family of Ruginoasa again unites their destiny with their girl in Palermo.
Crina now has 20 years, finish high school, after the Italian school model, but can begin a new chapter with Alina and Costică, her biological parents.
There are no borders or countries, but only a barrier: The language.
More than that, with the help of an interpreter, an Italian local owner in downtown Iașului, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make possible this meeting say that it is the first event of this kind, and that, in the future, if more ivește opportunity, it will do.
It is the first event of its kind held by such an emotional overtones, and I am glad to be a success.
We, at the Centre, we have different activities, and often are associated as an institution which deals only with the consumer, people dependent on drugs.
But we are trying to restore societații something good back.
"If I had asked for such a evenimeniment, I will do very dear," says smiling Romică Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Disease Prevention, Assessment and Counseling Drug Enforcement Iași.
Behind him, the Balcan, Crina in the middle, distance recounting.
I understand: They have a lot to say to each other.
Truce with the weapons in the leg, yesterday, the PSD.
Everyone and draw soul
The camps in ieșeană branch of the PSD reached a truce with the gun in his leg.
After successive rounds of discussions, conducted Friday through Sunday, the first being the most tense, the PSD leaders have agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Under the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, ieșeni Social Democrats will send him a list of potential candidates for positions in the party.
Far from being completed, the internal war in the party seems to have taken a break to allow combatanților to hold their soul.
Dragnea has not given an ultimatum.
Launched a very simple message and very current in the now: Try to find a solution in order not to endanger the party.
On 3 October we have elections in the party.
All the functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor, Michael Chirica.
The two days of discussions in the weekend led only to the conclusion that nothing certainly has not been established.
In the October elections, for the chairmanship of the județene branch of the PSD is expected a fierce competition.
On the short list of potential candidates for the top post in the party's ieșeană branch is Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, Județean Vasile Câtea adviser and acting President of the Council Județean, Victorel Lupu.
As they could add and Mayor comunei Schitu lead, Mihai Mihalache.
One option under consideration is the candidacy of the leader of the PSD județeni advisors, Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu won't enter the race, sources within the party saying that he is not interested in the post.
The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is the former leader of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
Under the statute, including on election day can be submitted applications, and would not Mira anyone if it would happen.
"It is important that we remain united, and we will stay and after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Bureau, a new Județean Permanent Bureau and all the new governance structures," said Câtea.
Until the internal elections, the județene branch of the PSD will be provided by Victorel Lupu, an associate of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu is still on leave until September 29th, the preparation of elections will actually be provided by the Executive branch secretary, adviser Județean Mihail Popescu, cold relations with the Nichita.
Telephone contact, Cristian Stanciu said the discussions in recent days as leading to "a partial consensus."
There is a broad willingness to maintain the balance and unity in the party.
It has reached a consensus, in part, to support a unified team to deal with județ.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions of the candidacy for the presidency of the PSD Iași, the list remains open," commented Stanciu.
A judge refused the ieșean rapists in Vaslui on the grounds outside of wedlock
The seven young men in Vaslui County Council sentenced for rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal Iași.
Vasluienii sentenced to jail terms of between five years and eight months and eight years and four months today will present their arguments on their freedom, after the fund, judecătoria Vaslui, set their incarceration immediately after her judgment.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal late last week, magistrate Dan Anton formulating a request for abstention, admitted his colleagues.
Anton cited the fact that one of the defendants lawyers, attorney Bogdan Luca, is concubinul his daughter, the lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca I defend Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the biggest punishment in this dossier.
How have motivated judges sentence
At the end of last week, the Vaslui judecătoria magistrate who sentenced the seven young motivated the sentence.
The motivation the judge talks about defiant reaction to the defendants, but also those who have supported him, saying that such attitudes creates a strong sense of outrage among the public.
"The court finds that after putting in the preventive measure of judicial control, restrictive measure of freedom but not custodial, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, families and their local supporters, was felt at the level of national and local community a strong sense of indignation about the fact that people accused of serious facts are prosecuted under a less restrictive measure," reads the motivation Judecătoriei Vaslui.
Also, they have been dismantled and the defence of the seven inculpați who during the trial cited the fact that the girl who raped her would not be "the door of the church."
"The court sublinază that lacks the moral quality of the relevance of the person injured, something which inculpații wanted to highlight the probe that they have made, as physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," the driver says.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
The economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last few decades can no longer continue in the coming years.
Until Saturday, probably little world knew in Romania who is Jeremy Corbyn.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many are wondering to what extent we can affect the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a position to decide.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical stângist laburiștilor's leader after the war.
Marxist said, anti-monarhist (asked at one point Tony Blair, then prime minister, to take the royal family of Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathiser of Vladimir Putin (was otherwise regularly invited to comment on political events by television channel "Russia Today"), and the terrorist movement Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and out of NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who was considered at the time the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
Following the model of all demagogilor populists, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous solutions anti-austerity.
Things like those which they said and promised, and Tsipras in Greece until given chest with the real world and economic legitățile.
The economic programme of the new Labour leader provides, among other things, the massive renaționalizări and printing money as a solution for financing development projects and coverage of some very generous social benefits.
Sure, some might wonder why the solution with printing money is not widely adopted across the globe, we then have a general global prosperity!, but who can prevent such details.
Sure, we can give the blood tax on bankers, becoming a kind of enemies in the service of the left, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the Mitterrand's mandates and Hollande.
Additional sums are quickly înghițite by generous promises, without coverage, made by populist demagogues.
As it drew the attention of Margaret Thatcher, "the problem with socialism is that at some point ends the money of others."
Few give real chances of Jeremy Corbyn to reach ever prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, which, however, was not as extreme in the belief that the newly appointed party leader, has failed miserably in the elections.
And then there are still in Britain a class muncitorească, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were sensitive more influential than now.
Under the terms of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the workforce, and extensive automatizări made in the industry to be massive need for highly qualified manpower, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
However, even in the opposition, he can influence important developments that may affect us directly.
In its latest Financial Times number believes that Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit, namely Britain's exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the bloc.
In the eyes of the radical left Brussels is the international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation which has imposed austerity on the poor.
When combini this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with the anti-immigration rhetoric and you uiți the refugee crisis that is shaking the foundations of the EU reach an explosive mixaj.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British people decide in a referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the symbolic capital loss for the entire European project and deep fault lines created inside the Euro crisis and now why refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leaves room for the most worrisome scenarios.
All the more so because for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterbalance to the Franco-German axis (which anyway Berlin is becoming increasingly dominant player).
Admittedly, the British business environment, City, are powerful lawyers of the backwardness of the country in the EU.
But Europe today is no longer in the past.
There are a lot of resentment, which are increasing in intensity even during these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I had just recently a sample in the speech of Jean Clude Junker, increasingly tends to take major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And what happens when the electoral support for formațiunile antisistem, anti-immigration at the same time and eurosceptic increase dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative overtones arrived at higher rates than ever in the past.
Where and draw the conclusion that the Financial Times when assessing the chances of Brexit.
Pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from the national interest.
If voters will take the brain, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us emoției power in the current policy.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we will have a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone, which will drive most of the countries in the region and on the outskirts of interest and that of the decision in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States are fuelling populist rhetoric of accumulated frustrations in oocidentale societies.
The economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last few decades, generous social benefits, can no longer continue in the coming years.
Under the pressure of explosive dual crisis, the Eurozone - immigration, both caused by rash decisions that have not taken into account than integraționiste political ambitions, and the ability and willingness of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turmoil on the continent, the internal tensions within the EU will increase in intensity and can affect major Romania's situation.
And it's hard to excluzi something in terms of the possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncuși, god țăran.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brâncuși: "Take and sweeps the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a big dream: To be someone, to get famous, to hear about him all over the world.
Behind his renumelui hiding but something almost forgotten today, when we are delivered millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.
That something has a name.
It is called "trudă."
What to write about Constantin Brâncuși?
What's there to say, really?
His figure appeared on banknotes.
And, recently, a bank in Romania has hired an actor to play in a billboard today.
Brâncuși produces and supplies money to nearly 60 years is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and bulevarde that bears the name.
In fact, even the author of this text live on one of these streets.
And when out on the outside with odrasla, hears the following instructions: "Go into the park, Brâncuși."
The country is împânzită of its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to all the world, from children to the elderly.
The Brâncuși's infiltration is a huge.
Neither the Communists failed to extirpe in memory and culture of Romania.
His recitations plaster today the Internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of Like and share.
And then, again, what would be said, by writing about this man?
Viewed from grămada of books and articles trying to rebuilding the destiny, Brâncuși's life seems almost fantastical, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell me that if you haven't had the good fortune to naști in any big city and in a family of wealthy, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
Contraexemplul Brâncuși's life is perfect.
And maybe there would be a key.
Perhaps there should be started the text that follows.
A sentence, no matter how loathsome they are.
Forget cretine success stories, which are delivered daily in the newspapers and on television.
Look carefully figure of this man.
You want to know how to manage in life, how, today, he heard a whole world?
It is.
He worked all his life to be someone.
It did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on 19 February 1876, Hobița, a small village in common Peștișani, Gorj County Council, at the foothills of the Carpathian.
It is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although it came from a family of wealthy peasants, Brâncuși leads a modest life, but one that had to collect the benchmarks that will guide the late artistic vision.
Recalling and childhood and where he grew up, he had to confess, in a meeting with Petre Țuțea, in Paris in 1933: "Then life was beautiful and harmonious."
For millennia, people did, happy, a patriarchal life.
It was reassuring from one season to another.
And you know why things have changed?
The great city civilisation came up to us.
But Brâncuși's childhood was far from one idilică.
One of the times in these early years of life is very revealing for the combination of purity and violence that have characterised the future sculptor years spent in the home.
The time is reproduced in the "Brâncuși. A biography," written by Alexander Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncuși have 3 years.
In the autumn of that year, when it was the "giant" țuica, pursuing those who degustă lichidul to see if the process is conducted properly, Brâncuși catch a moment of general neatenție.
They fill căușul palmelor with nerăsuflate țuică and drink on.
Falls into sleep almost instantly.
The first people notice only after a few minutes.
Mother panic, then in the hysteria, believing that his son died.
In the evening, when the father, Radu, returning from vivid accompanied by lăutari, he sees in the desperate signs of those who await him with heart in mouth.
The party turns immediately to jale.
The father is already considering îngropăciune.
However, someone finds that it is good to phone the Baba Brândușa, doftoroaie and servants of Brâncușilor.
Brândușa verifies the breath of the child, then put them under the nose of the horse balegă, gathered from preajmă.
The child strănută.
World applauds.
While the boy is left to sleep on beția, joy, the party with lăutari continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet through the orchard.
Radu Constantin Brâncuși puts it on to collect some nuiele and to bring them.
The father așază child with their heads down, and with nuielele brought by the boy, knocking him to keep in mind.
And while feels usturimea blows, the small revelația Brâncuși is that the world can be seen from another perspective, and that things can arise around toppling.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well known, makes him wonder, as have to acknowledge in their old age, if not himself astrul attend disturbance.
And the sun was equally disturbed as his father of what is întâmplase?.
At present, the city is not
An MP is calling on politicians to remember those who have voted.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuț appealed to the PSD and PNL to stop the infighting and refocus the agenda for the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great divide and so on.
I have not seen anything in the USL projects in 2012 that will continue.
Neither highway nor Regional hospital emergencies, you see just how politicians are dispute possible locations depending on the real estate interests.
To leave a little politics aside, to gather and talk.
At present, the city is not working.
"If you are filled with domestic war, most of the time for those who you have chosen," said Blăjuț.
He said that the current political class of dezămăgit ieșean electorate, the result will be a very small presence in the upcoming local elections, around the figure of 30%, which is basically the electorate of the party faithful.
Also, the MP believes voters will move increasingly towards the traditional parties, expressing their reserve with new political initiatives, such as the "For Iași" which will be launched today.
The local parties have very small chances and will not only break in the electorate right, not from the PSD.
Such parties are based on civic active people, who usually are on the right.
"It fărâmițează further right, which is not good for anyone, neither for the PSD," said Blăjuț.
He said he is not interested in a bid to the upcoming local elections, disproving rumours about its intention to join the race for City Hall.
I said that I do not want to I ran at a local office.
I am still considering whether to continue as an MP and in the future.
I tried to call for unity to Iași and discussions in the hallways, with other lawmakers, and I was charged that I want to make the picture.
I do not want, but we can no longer continue.
"If people have voted, does not mean that they are stupid to vote if I don't see anything," said Blăjuț, who said that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is aleșilor hypocrisy.
A colleague from Tătărași said he does not get the money and we have to go by bus.
Let us not be hypocrites.
There are few money.
Sometimes I am ashamed to raise money in the kitty.
At the end of the mandate will make a report with everything I spent outside the salaries of employees in the cabinet and its maintenance.
It happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lions, although deconturile transport, accommodation and others.
"Let's say an MP that does not get the money is clean hypocrisy," concluded Blăjuț.
