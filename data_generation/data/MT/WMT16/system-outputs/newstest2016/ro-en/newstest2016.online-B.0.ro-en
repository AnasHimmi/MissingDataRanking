UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that its response to military support from Russia for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that has lasted for nearly five years and more weapons would only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council to unite and support the negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday in a conference that plans to meet this month with the foreign ministers of five countries constantly present in the council - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the council and divisions between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation unresolved."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they failed to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 digits in polls showing that Donald Trump has a real chance
Some have tried to label him as a politician "flip-flop".
Others called him a joke.
Still others expect implosion.
But regardless of how some Republicans are trying to tear down Donald Trump at the top of the polls, did not work (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed that Donald Trump drive with a two-digit percentage and some voices are beginning to wonder seriously what this means for the chances of appointment of estate mogul.
Of course, it is still early.
None of this does not say that Trump will win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits shows that in the same period of 2011, the advance Rick Perry Herman Cain was making his place in the polls, but none of them won any state nominating race.
And the reasons that would fight hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Super PAC's Jeb Bush and the conservative group Club for Growth admit economic power of Trump and begin to support it with money.
Below you some figures from recent surveys suggest that real estate mogul is not just a passing thing:
The figures indicate support for Trump turned 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump to announce his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by Monmouth University showed that only two of 10 Republicans had a positive view of real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage climbed to 40%.
In early August was 52%.
Currently, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative view.
These figures remain.
A Quinnipiac poll last week in Iowa found that 60% of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump would win the race for the nomination.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN / ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump would win the race for the nomination.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if Trump would win the race for the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be "enthusiastic" compared to 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if the favorite wins the race for the nomination Jeb Bush.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's temper problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his style bombastic insults and 52% of Republican voters nationwide believe that real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to ABC News poll conducted months / Washington Post.
We find the same figures in Iowa, where 52% of Republicans still believe that Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% believe that it has the personality needed to act effectively and nearly six in 10 independent states that his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When taking the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters believe that Trump is authentic.
According to a survey conducted last week by CNN / ORC, the question of who is most likely to win the race for the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump.
The situation changed towards the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: Previously, GOP voters have not read very good future.
In the same period last elections four in 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most voters considered plausible GOP's campaign Trump.
Even if Republicans or retreated to another candidate. Trump still tops all.
Some say that the situation will likely contribute divided Trump's victory, while supporting Trump will split more than twelve candidates.
But a survey conducted in early September by Monmouth University shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates almost always Trump will receive majority support.
Trump is distant 13 points Carly Fiorina, 14 points Marco Rubio 15 points Walker, 19 points Jeb Bush and, finally, how many 33 points against Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It is almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who defeats?
Ben Carson would defeat businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical one on one confrontation.
Most Donald Trump's supporters say they have decided.
A new survey conducted Tuesday by CBS / NYT shows that more than half of voters who support the Trump says no option to change their vote.
Obviously, a lot can happen on this and nobody can say that they will not ever change his mind.
46% say it leaves the door open to the possibility to change the option.
However, the most important opponent of Trump neurosurgeon Ben Carson is now, but it is twice as likely voters who say they decided to vote for Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say that I agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Since Donald Trump called them immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his opening speech of his campaign two months ago, immigration was central in the 2016 campaign.
Some are worried that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between major Hispanic voters and will harm the Republican Party and rebranding efforts.
However, according to the survey conducted months of ABC / Post, six in 10 Republicans say that I agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, as will remain Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities reach new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to the poll months ABC / Post, six in 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at Washington.
A survey conducted in two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the performance of congressional Republicans, 54% declaring themselves "dissatisfied" and 21% "nervous as hell".
Jeremy Corbyn makes its debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn debut at PMQs was long expected
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will make its debut later at Prime Minister's Questions, faced for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions that entitled shortly after noon; his performance will likely be examined closely by the media and Labour MPs.
In the weekly appearances, he urged "less theater and more facts."
He also said some may waive participation and gives them his colleagues.
Confrontation will be the first test of Mr Corbyn MP in leadership, coming after he called a "shadow cabinet" and after the speech that I gave TUC annual congress Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to remain silent in speaking of the national anthem in a sermon held Tuesday to celebrate 75 years since the Battle of Britain drew criticism from some Conservative MPs and held the headlines.
Mr Corbyn decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he "respectfully silent" and recognized "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But a cabinet member ghost of Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, told Newsnight broadcast transmitted by BBC Two's that would be recommended to sing the national anthem Labour leader "irrespective" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve cabinet ministers ghost refused to join the team leading to Mr. Corbyn, arguing differences of opinion related to the economy, defense and foreign, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party I supported as a leader.
BBC political correspondent of Robin Brant says political differences "accumulate" in the Labour Party after the appointment of Mr. Corbyn of its position towards the European Union and limited benefits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party will make changes that will eliminate the whole idea of limits.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Work and Pensions Minister, said the party "very clear" in exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the "cap" of 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron faced the rostrum in the last decade since assuming leadership of the Conservative Party.
Labour leader who promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from external sources" for questions to pose to Mr Cameron and it received over 30,000 suggestions.
Islington North MP said that implies a level of confrontation PMQs too high and that they will refrain from replicates and attacks, pledging instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take place at PMQs when he can not attend - for example when Mr Cameron traveling abroad.
He also expressed the idea that will allow other colleagues to speak casually, saying that it approached the Chamber of Deputies Speaker, John Bercow, to discuss the matter.
In 2005, when he took over the leadership, Mr Cameron said he wants to give up political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs but acknowledged that a few years later failed in his endeavor.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs was considered a barometer key argument of a leader, the way in which it leads the Chamber of Deputies and its position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics say has that become a caricature and it needs profound reform.

Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised, not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was collateral damage in the "storm" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios and his conduct rather deserves praise, not criticism, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest of the talented duo often called "Special Ks" unpleasantly was dragged into the spotlight by slipping Kyrgios outrageous that it had to Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a match dreadful qualifying play shortly after, in Cincinnati, referee chair had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his adversary Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have Kyrgios put him to the ground, and I should have put it down on this kid. "
Although he was last seen by a rocket dust after having muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, Richard Gasquet upset, Kokkinakis was vigorously defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where Sam Groth battle for second place individually after Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup semifinal against England.
"One thing I feel strongly is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little conflict," said Healy.
The truth is that broke a racket when lost because of cramps accused in US, but it is not the first player to break a racket in frustration to himself and Thanasi I know well enough to know that 's not I am proud of that.
But let's face it, was mastered extremely well in situations quite challenging US with Harrison and so on and I think that deserves trust.
It has a great team, has a great family together and I think he was treated unjustly.
Is a 19 year old very mature, hardworking and its integration into the team, did not have any conflict with other players, is highly respected field, train hard, is in excellent shape, is a young very balanced and mature and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of its strengths and weaknesses.
Healy also defended the decision not to take into account the Kyrgios for the match draw important, which begins Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most suitable for us all, but argued comeback player originally from Canberra term long team.
"First, we want the team to focus totally on the match draw and not think about all the controversy surrounding him [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick stepped up very quickly, as they said people like Federer and Murray, he matures under the gaze of the public and made some mistakes terrible and deserves to be criticized, but we are trying to support, try to help him understand consequences of his actions and believe he needs a time that is not in the spotlight in order to reflect, which is better for the team and for him.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders was halved in national surveys
Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit advantage in the race for the Democratic nomination at the national level, but Sen. Bernie Sanders gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of voters Democrats (down from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15% of voters Democrats.
At least five months before the start of primary elections, most voters Democrats say it is too early to say that they have decided on which candidate they will back.
But Clinton's supporters are firm in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the survey conducted by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton keeps lead at women and moderates, but the advantage was reduced.
Support among men was reduced considerably and Sanders is at a distance of only 5 points.
Clinton's lead among Democratic voters under the age of 50 years evaporated and is now tied with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still ahead among voters older.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with a two-digit percentage among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight advantage by 5 points in this group.
About half of Democratic voters nationwide by states that would support it enthusiastically on whether Clinton would be chosen to run in the party's name.
A quarter would support a somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it only because it is party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the probability that Clinton's current supporters to be enthusiastic about his choice is high.
Opinions are mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48% of voters say they would support Democrats enthusiastically Clinton a number of Republicans voters who say the same about the first ranked Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When supporters of Clinton is addressed an open question on why they would like her to win the race, the answer mostly is that it has appropriate expertise (16%), followed by that the time has come for a woman to be president ( 13%) and that is the best candidate for this office (10%).
Clinton's supporters mentions its association with Bill Clinton (9%).
It is also mentioned agreement on these issues and eligibility.
Given that takes into account a possible vice presidential candidate, Democrats and 57% of voters would like to see the race - although a third think it should not apply.
When asked about the second option for the party, voters on Biden majority Democrats call.
Among supporters of Clinton, more than half say that Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the race of the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's lead in front of Sanders increase from 20 points to 30 points in the race Biden if not running.
55% of voters Democrats consider Clinton the candidate with the best chance to win the general election; But the figures have dropped from 78% as they were last month.
Biden is distant second but the percentage that the rose is the most eligible.
However, when asked what is most important in a candidate elected, voters prefer Democrats eligibility issues instead.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate is not regarded by voters as unacceptable as representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well in terms of some key features to their party's primary voters.
It found most voters Clinton and Biden Sanders as upright and trustworthy and having strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen best of the three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's forte is leadership.
30% of voters do not believe that H. Clinton Democrats is integral and reliable, twice more than those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% have no opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally considered that the three, Clinton, Biden and Sanders have the same ideologies as them.
Regarding all these issues, about a quarter of voters Democrats have no opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist regarding the use of personal addresses of email and a server by Hillary Clinton when he was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with the explanation thereof on the subject and say that it has not affected the general opinion towards the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are unhappy with her explanation now, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided on the subject in March, shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans declare that the controversy over email not affected their general opinion about Clinton, while 36% say they have changed their minds in a negative way.
Mostly Republicans, more than six in 10 say they have changed their opinion about Clinton in the negative.
Although voters Democrats consider Clinton integral and reliable, this continues to lift them up trouble among voters overall: only 32% consider integral and reliable, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider integrity and trust.
Meanwhile, 55% of voters nationwide do not consider Trump honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated Biden, Carson and Bush are classified first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who thinks Sanders whole is greater than those who are not of the same opinion but, as in the case of Carson, many have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 voters Democratic primary is 6 percentage points.
Five fraternity members indicted for killing one student in the Faculty Baruch
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation rite Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the fraternity Pi Delta Psi Faculty Baruch in New York attacked him brutally Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation rite in September 2013 and postponed to take him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources said the victim was blindfolded and was placed behind a 14 kg backpack filled with sand and was bullied repeatedly while trying to move toward a target on a frozen field.
Mr. Deng accused headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members have called the emergency number after he fainted and alleged that they had waited for an hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
They found the time required to change his clothes Deng, look for symptoms such Google and to contact Andy Meng, president of the fraternity nationally for advice, said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
"At this time, members began to hide personal belongings and laid basically good brotherhood before Michael Deng's good," said Wagner.
He could not be resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by the fraternity's rituals, since 1970 at least one student has died every year due rites," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable and this action by the authorities is important.
Monroe District Grand Jury recommended that the five members are charged with third-degree murder.
Other thirty-two mebrii of brotherhood, including Mr. Meng will be placed also charged with assault and complicity to murder.
"We want to hold accountable not only those involved but if there is an organization that authorized the brotherhood, formal or informal, we will draw also accountable," Wagner said Tuesday in a press conference.
Faculty Baruch banned brotherhood and national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representative.
Here's what will happen when the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates
The interest rate will rise and the bull market (rising market) will stumble, bond profitability will increase and the economy will go into recession.
That we know.
What we do not know is how long it will happen and how long.
In economics, history provides few clues on the timing ..
After the first interest rate increase should the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
Aggression Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a key determinant of how the economy responded and financial assets.
Therefore, the US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on the moment they start to grow interest rate trajectory but the time required for normalization.
Indeed, at stake are multiple variables.
But in the end, market players may find that the excitement related to interest rate increase was exaggerated.
"The first interest rate increase by the Fed decided after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of voices era" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we expect gradual return of US interest rates to more normal levels but still small constitute seismic shock which all seem to fear.
But you can not say that there will be no effect.
The following are how they might react a few sectors of the economy, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, the anticipation of interest rate increases may volatilize things for a while.
However, when the growth impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems there is a tendency to stagnate ROE for 12-24 months after the first increase, reflecting perhaps the new phase shift monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after Fed increases.
Specifically, in the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by about 14 percent - heading toward raising interest rates quite invariable during the 250 days after (average climb 2.6%) and then returns to normal after 500 days with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published in Barron by Nuveen Asset Management chief strategist.
Deutsche said the impact of actions tend to become more pronounced later in the cycle of interest rate increase and the benefits begin to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life but interest rate increase often contributes to it.
In the present case, the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a downturn.
Specifically, GDP will approach its historic low point for a Fed rate hikes.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases after 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was lower by 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter 2015 value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising interest rates in an economy so fragile could be risky and might raise the question "if this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market players have been preparing all year for a decision to raise the Fed, all eyes were fixed on this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in interest rates at this meeting, forward transactions indicates a probability of only 25%.
"In our study developed after 1950, all cycles of rate hikes so far have been in a super cycle profit growth, GDP obscuring peaks before the recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, it was a strangely slow recovery after the worst recession period.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected Fed at the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and counting.
Fixed income has also been volatile since the market expects an increase in the interest rate and pattern is somewhat similar to the dividend.
The main difference is that the impact is faster than the bonds to shares when Fed policy changes.
In the case of bonds, apparently benefits changes direction once occurs first increase / decrease in the cycle.
At the end of its rate hikes, immediately lowers bond yields, "said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab strategies are of the opinion that these interest rate increases will result in near-term profitability between bonds and short-term, aplatizând curve.
High yield bonds are better in such an environment, although "we are still cautious forcing linked to profitability," said an analysis Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"In addition to the strong dollar and lower inflation estimate, there are some signs that the market was adapted to the more rigorous monetary policy perspective," wrote Jones.
Short-term interest rates increased profitability curve is straight, the spread average interest rate of the loan was extended and increased volatility - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Overall, companies that operate mainly in the US will benefit from increased interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the increase in the dollar will lead to higher prices on their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that stocks" quality "tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate increases," Goldman Sachs analyst said in a report to clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets have exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital receipts and with low volatility stocks also exceeded similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (pp).
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, says Goldman.
Consumers will also benefit from increased dollar.
Savers could also benefit, although experts disagree tied to how quickly this will happen.

In the first half of this year, the editor of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that should make more effort to attract audience from the previous period because the British have less knowledge about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only item found under the name BBC criticized the meeting of the Board of Culture, media and sport that would follow in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - talent show at BBC bought Dutch manufacturer Talpa Media for an amount of around 22 million pounds.

According to analysts cumulative financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers three-year fixed interest rate for lei, by 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, offer conversion of Banca Transilvania was accepted by 83% of clients with loans in francs due to two successive reductions: reduced balance with the amount of the risk and management paid by the client, then applied a further reduction of 22.5% from the balance in lei.
Both offers its customers reduced rates, monthly payments as compared to the equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduce the rate by 42.5% and Bancpost, 33% in the first three years, virtually 18% in coming years.
benefits
The main advantage of covresiei RON loans in CHF is that it eliminates currency risk, the consumer is protected from future growth of the franc and the repayment of the loan will be made in the currency of cash their salary.
Another major advantage of both offers conversion is not reevaluate the property, no longer require additional guarantees and another proof of income.
Basically, there will be a new financial and legal analysis of the loan and will not be additional costs when refinancing.
Also, both banks offer monthly discount compared to paying customers as before conversion, equivalent in lei.
risks
The problem is that the rate in the early years is made more in interest and principal client reimburses very little.
Bancpost offer with very little interest in the first three years appears advantageous for clients.
But it is unknown how it will evolve interest after three years.
Before clients can be offered more than 3.25%, so the total, and reducing cost is less.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with a variable interest rate is the index ROBOR to grow significantly in the coming years (more than Libor index - CHF).
For example ROBOR three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 had reached 6% in 2009 to over 15% and in a few days in 2008 exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to have other costs, not included in the initial offer.
It is time for decisions on the interest rate the US Federal Reserve
Fix the world for their scheduled meeting over two days, Wednesday and Thursday when the US Federal Reserve will take the crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, just over half believed that last week the decision will be taken now believe that the situation will keep for a while and that interest rates will be kept current in the range of 0- 0.25%.
It is a historic event because it had been seven years since the Fed brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank rate could drop to zero and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy performed relatively well, making recovery trillion balance sheet and generating a low inflation.
But the Fed should not ignore the overall situation less rosy.
He warned to prepare markets for an increase but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced Tuesday at 20:00 CET.

Luke Shaw player from Manchester United sits on the bar a few months due to double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right foot in the game against Manchester United in the Champions League ended with a defeat against PSV Eindhoven.
After the event which brought tears in his eyes and player that will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw could play again this season.
The injury occurred after a reckless interventions by Héctor Moreno after 15 minutes after Shaw, aged 20 years, broke the PSV defense.
He received medical attention on the pitch for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has double fracture to the leg and is in hospital."
She will be transferred tomorrow or the day after tomorrow and then will be operated in Manchester.
It is awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18 years old, difficulties, then play fantastic and now this happens.
In the locker room I was put oxygen mask.
Crying.
No doctor, but the rest is double fracture of six months and will not play in the group stage.
I hope to be able to play again this season.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped a red card and a penalty concession.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli he has not punished the mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that Italian official wrong.
You can judge for themselves when I say that it is a foul and red card.
It was a very ugly intervention, with two legs.

Adam Lyth England risked failure but clearly still take hard

Clearly, as his coach at Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth team.
He played seven Test matches against two good strikers, in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no questions related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said this before - the players are their own spotter.
Fifty years and Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope that if you make several run-ins for Yorkshire will get other opportunities.
Head coach of the England team, Trevor Bayliss and praised the attitude even when performance was not the extent of its capacity and it does not surprise me; above all, he is a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long is noted a batsman in test matches.
Lyth had run seven sites - as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Compton was lucky only home and away.
The only complaint that we had was that England can I preferred to Jonathan Trott tour of the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top form - but that missed opportunity is history.
Alex Hales coming team, a batsman you I rate very well.
It is a cricketer who has the "X factor" and I noticed Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge pitch.
Should be given at least the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on team composition in UAE.
It was launched Moeen idea to open a fight with Cook, which would extra spinner while keeping four QuickSite, and I have nothing against.
I do not see why a pitcher could not hit awkwardly there and this player has already shown that it is hell.
Perhaps Moeen has not brought success in his district, Worcestershire, but was no. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.

He learns a lot from this tournament.
England has made some changes and the team coaches.
Mahela Jayawardene's appointment, Sri Lankan batsman in a consultant for test matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the best players and will bring a wealth of experience, given that he played in all circumstances and against all types of attacks.

I always thought that was born to engage in international cricket either as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela has intuition.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if transmit messages that were sent before, can bring fresh air into the team.
Durham Colly's teammate, Ben Stokes rests for one day matches, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although not all agree, coaches and selectors do not program.
And please note, the jobs of players depend on the results they obtain.
Such decisions are not taken never easy.
Brexit camp could prevail if the economy remains in lull 2017
Day by day, the strategy of renegotiating David Cameron to keep Britain in the EU fall louder in trouble even without choosing the brilliant Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn leadership of the Labour Party and TUC brings Tuesday serious criticisms against Europe.
Foreigners are also characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained that the last days - immersed in crisis similar to that in the EU - not all of which caused internal - some Member States are fueled by Britain's agenda concessions and changes to the treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, the annual meeting, TUC decided that they do not want this if would erode social protection.
We could even call agenda "self" Dave and George.
Prime Minister and Chancellor participating in summits or bilateral sessions of foreign capital, they take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local representative, then return home and say they have gained allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My friend Europe, which wants a UK perspective outwards under the roof of the EU - "Do not leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that several ministers and officials obtuse in certain capitals have reached the point where they do not care if stay or go.
Angela Merkel, German chancellor extremely cautious, is an ally but stayed in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation to falter, as with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16) who stayed too long.
In 2017, the French President, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland may soon have a government right-wing nationalist, Spain one left.
It is hard to believe that they will help British posing, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland to leave the UK - something they do not want any because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, even some ministers could plan intended to make remarks which do not help in the style SNP in the campaign for a referendum in the UK in 2017 to speed up Brexit suggest my friend.
"The renegotiation was fixed" and "Britain has not achieved anything of value from renegotiation".
Europeans know their skin as monopolizing can be Fleet Street and how skeptical are the barons of the media oligarchy which concern the EU with skepticism because they did not participate in the referendum of 1975 inspired by Tony Benn to ratify our accession to the 1973 report 2 1.
I can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 90s when he was corespodent of Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included rogues mixture non-member fees, telephone fraud and pseudo foreign non-domi holding most major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them pretty much the same, however, realized that when you're locked in a cage with a gorilla nervous to give him bananas to distract attention from the thought of you eat lunch and again tea.
In fact, Miliband was Blair than Blair in opposition to the idea of Cameron's referendum, given that Blair has made a concession on principle against the EU constitution abandoned, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, i- gave himself out.
The media did not forgiven him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me in a friendly back Monday at Westminster - I said to no longer consume time with me - seems to be threatening to take the egg strategy Murdoch boycott of Neil Kinnock 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take, but must develop a coherent strategy for cooperation with the media, not me, but certainly with Andrew Marr on BBC whose position left vacant a Sunday.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call indulgently evolution.
He says he would like to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with "Anglicism" conservatives would agree with that.
That said Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennati" Benn radio and TV this week when scout in he fought not to recognize that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as minister "shadow" on financial problems It was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father was fighting on TV to be disloyal Labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing function in the cabinet.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what he said or what McDonnell said JC colleagues and lawmakers in private meeting Monday night.
Whichever image you want to convey Corbyn - note, it sensitized and me - discipline remains important messages in the age of television and especially in the vortex of social networks, an outbreak of paranoia and betrayal.
OK not to be given a free pass by Cameron in Europe, enabling them to take good support Labour in the referendum campaign, as stated McDonnell.
Simon Jenkins certainly think so.
But the basic fallacy of McDonnell and Corbyin on EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents for the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophism on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant on that JC will not campaign for the waiver - diplomats will have to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin to waste political capital - and there are voters suspicious - for concessions from Britain when everything could be futile?
US are already quite disappointed linked to poor performance of the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a Conservative government that cut costs, as I was reminded launch British Influence Security Forum Monday.
Specialists criticizes the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, a government agency claims that the electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of them with ties to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the journal British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined in criticizing the Lancet publication of evidence used by the Department of Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the report "reference" last month and described him as "a comprehensive analysis of the evidence."
But some scholars have questioned the robustness of the data and have pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked "extraordinarily fragile basis" on which he founded his main conclusion PHE.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ allegations were questioned and their substantiation "on solid ground or on quicksand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health Europe at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on proof effectiveness."
He said he expects the PHE claims that 'current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking "are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and patterns.
In fact, one meeting attended by 12 men led to the development of a model with multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) summarizing their views about the negative effects associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of this meeting were summarized in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell or one of the sponsors stated that the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, about whose chief executive was said to have received funding in the past from British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.
It also validated the BAT accreditation in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting said funding received from a manufacturer of electronic cigarettes but not funding which there are reports that it received from tobacco companies and tobacco, Philip Morris International.
No arguments were provided on which panel members were selected but these include some "leaders" known manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, some of them even says in the paper industry funding.
Other participants in the meeting are known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by head of tobacco control of the PHE.
The research paper developed by the group "muşamalizează convincingly" that lacks "robust evidence of the harmful effect it has on most products according to most criteria," said McKee and Capewell.
However, the report does not mention PHE links, or any of these limitations.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE claims that "so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor in encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health of the PHE, say they responded to the allegations in the past BMJ.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are less harmful than smoking significantly"
One of two people who smoked all his life loses his life because of this defect.
All the evidence suggests that the risk posed to health electronic cigarettes are comparatively minor, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE is a clear duty to inform the public about the information that emerge and those not already in evidence, especially given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Annually, about 80,000 people die from a disease associated with smoking and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Clearly expressing the current evidence - that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risks, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfill our national debt.

Ads that embarrass Britain's arms trade
Watch the video made by Amnesty International against the arms fair.
Killer Drone terrible!
Beasts to crush ankles!
Cluster bombs!
And electric batons causing horrendous pain without leaving a trace!
Cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advertising for the largest fair global arms is a charade fierce conducted by Amnesty International to highlight the desire of the British authorities to sell weapons repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also led to a large number of posters displayed in bus shelters and subways that need a second look.
"Important notice, traveling by DLR between 15 and 18 September?" Says one ad, using fonts and branding London Underground, DLR line transformed into the image of a tank.
In September this year, a lot of arms dealers will pounce on DLR Clients are required to contribute to stopping arms fair.
The 300 posters were made by artists who have exhibited at the Museum Cruel Designs in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group contributed to distribute in London using the "Ad Space Hack Packs", a package of six pounds of Allen keys which states that "facilitates access to about a third of the ad space on bus shelters on the planet. "
Directed by London Transport is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of leaflets.
One of the ads parody products Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists increasingly ask more questions and seek to do political work accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are turning to collaboration with activists in the protests, realizing that needs to get out in the real world because their art has an impact on society.
Another poster against arms trade which face commuters traveling by Metro.

Creative director of VCCP ,, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the creative trade fair of arms - with a blank space in the calendar ExCel - and was thought "Let's give them the campaign is trying to avoid."
They played with the realization of a creative but realistic "animation and enriching it with strong colors was striking."
"They did a great job helping us grow interest in the illegal sale of torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, as the UK authorities need to take action and to ensure that torture equipment are not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer products fantastically euphemistic.
In a press release, Saab has disclosed an order from the US military on "AT4CS RS launcher with support on the shoulder."
This includes "warhead with a unique shape that offers amazing effects behind armor inside the target.

Eight golden rules to live at home
It has been 11 years since I moved into the home, when I was a young man of 19, who still believed in berets and relativity of morality, but only now I remember the smiles are forced those they are angry - and numerous complaints from others.

Moving home can bring states ranging from breakdown in horror.
Chatter is tempting: to tell people where you live, if and where you spent a gap year from education, what do you think about Corbyn and that "frankly, I do not care Marmite because, honestly guys, is nothing but yeast extract HAHAHA, I'll be in my room. "
Breathe deeply.
And help them and others to breathe - ask questions and show interest.
These animated conversation and helps you differentiate people that you like from what you did not talk even if the flood would come and they would be the only ones who would have boats.
Do not suffocate people.
Bedrooms often replete with drinks parties, movie nights and meetup, but there are also where people dress and prove their underwear.

A girl on the landing I asked his neighbor to give the music down because it was 3 am and have a morning exam.
Their reaction was to give the music louder.
When the music stopped eventually, at 5 o'clock in the morning, the girl was nice and I was allowed to sleep two hours before we hit the maximum in music, locked the door and left the examination which lasted three hours.
There would be romantic if your future husband / future wife would move on the same level?

Violinist David Grimal: In the era of Bach there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and representatives not commercial.
Violinist French David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist and as initiator of a project unusual, downright "weird", says even he, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international singers and musicians, who plays a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and this makes it at least a curiosity in classical music scene.
Les Dissonances was this year Enescu Festival with two shows: a performance on Sunday, the singer was David Grimal, founder of the orchestra and one month when the spotlight was found cellist Xavier Phillips, works composed by Enescu is always present.
Both shows, performed on the stage of the Athenaeum, showed the audience a different way of interpreting classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004, at that time, only classical musical ensemble in which there is a conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand musicians need to be educated to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - talk instrumentalists, and composers not.
They are trained as "specialized workers".
Themselves feel they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, to the public, all fetishism focuses on musical conductor.
And so, business, music industry, makes marketing.
Therefore, not to mention the music.
So if we look at this world, on the one hand we have skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that may not listen, but you have to look, and what is stupid, "said David Grimal.
Violinist says that this change in the way they make music came from "musical deception" of his career as a soloist.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise in different orchestras around the world, to earn money and to make money and the music industry.
10 years ago, when I was around 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because she could not find creativity and human brotherhood in this system.
So, I have not found any sense to continue on this path.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happens in 2004, and at that time nobody was doing so without a conductor: "The world music, very conservative, unwilling such projects."
"How do I imagine marketing a collective of musicians that there was no ego?" asks the artist.
David Grimal Les Dissonaces admits is "a luxury", adding that none of orchestra musicians are part of the success of this project does not depend for a living.
In 10 years of assembly, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be an obstacle in the act musical "Curiously, the more we sing a repertoire more complex, the more it seems easier, because all musicians are required to be present in the work and not just the role, "says Grimal, adding that the show Sunday" was 74 conductors on the scene. "
According to Grimal, Enescu Festival is "very brave" just because he invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, which present the greatest orchestras in the world to sing and 3 times per day, and in the midst of orchestras have invited this group weird. "
In a temple of orchestral tradition, as is the Enescu Festival, there place and interest in something different that breaks the barriers.
Speaking about the work of Enescu, Romanian violinist admits he feels the music the famous Romanian composer, so did not need a special approach when introduced in repertory works by Enescu.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but that happens when we speak of George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is a George Enescu who did French music."
Grimal strives to change the way education is classical music, considering that "being a musician, as it is organized today, have a taste of death" and that "the future of music is the music itself."
We do not need to do a world tour 5 times a year if it does not serve anything.
In Bach's era there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who were working that were not artists and commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, release albums, they are all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as you do music service.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffer, no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave the example of Romanian products before and after EU accession: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had better vegetables and meat."
To enter the EU had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Agriculture production and service reach the supermarket, as happens in France.
The same thing happens with music, is the same logic.
Les Dissonances make red can not really nice, but when they are cut red true.
In an ideal world, should that music to return to the center and that the institutions and industries that manages this system to understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this may start educational policy.
"If I believe - as do the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese - as Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce learning into school, I reintroduce concerts on television and through this education would no longer need to offal sell music, "said Grimal.
Certainly, there are things that remain very classical musical education communist everywhere this is a very militarized.
It depends on the discipline if you compare a musician with a soldier, or if that will form a musician playing an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
Education mention a completely different if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) Must be somehow, if we want to form a musician is something else.
After your parearea, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? "Asks French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that artists, reward a different way of making music comes from the overcoming of this status "soldier", overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at some point that there are soldiers, and therefore out smiling after the concert. "
David Grimal explained how the musical and his vision for the music and the artist in the "Festival of Ideas", a public discussion organized in the George Enescu International Festival of the Aspen Institute Romania.
Profile David Grimal

Besides his career as a solo artist, David Grimal wanted to explore and personal projects.
Freedom of whom he offered a collaboration with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner world by venturing into repertoires that are not accessible solo artists.

FedEx earnings are mixed, lower tax projections for 2016
FedEx said disappointing results for the last quarter, the delivery giant reducing profit estimates for the entire year due to low demand for transport services and increased costs for land transport division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's shares fell about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the opening bell sound on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. It said it expects to earn between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, 20 cents less, according to previous estimates.
Analysts predicted figure of $ 10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
Estimating declining prices comes despite increased 4.9% on average, with effect on January 4 and higher surcharges for land transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply in November.
The company said it still expects earnings growth over the previous year due to reduced costs, higher revenues and development of online trade.
President and Chief Executive Fred Smith said that "the company is facing an economic situation considerably worse than expected, especially in terms of production and global trade."
Hiring plans for holidays they were announced a day after competitor UPS said it plans to hire additional workers 90000-95000, about the same number of employments that we made last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $ 692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
Earnings per share were $ 2.42, below the average estimate of $ 2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit increased 5% to $ 12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the survey conducted by Zacks estimated amount of $ 12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, which led to the stagnation recorded revenues of its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping division leaped results FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenues ground division rose 29% but operating income virtually stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
Express unit increased revenue due to higher base rates, while the incomes of the freight division fell due to rising costs.
At pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares had fallen 3.85 dollars or 2.5%, at $ 150.15.
Tuesday closing level had dropped by 11% on year and 17% of the peak recorded record on June 11.
At its most anticipated meeting in years, policymakers at the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a table Mahogany Honduran 27 feet to decide whether the time has come to increase a key rate of interest first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the assembly hall of the central bank, will glimpse a mural of the United States.
The map is intended to Janet L. Yellen recalled that, Fed Chairman, and his colleagues must put economic interests of the nation above all.
Central Bank received a double burden from Congress: to maximize employment rates in the US workforce and maintain price stability.
But the Great Depression, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is an unwritten third task: financial stability.
And this third pregnancy could be the X factor in a decision too difficult to predict which will be announced Tuesday, which will determine whether the US economy is ready to be rid of the incentive unprecedented offered rate short-term interest close zero effect from the end of 2008.
Even if most of the data indicates a growing economy strong agitation recent global financial markets might scare Fed officials already wary of adding volatility by raising the benchmark federal funds - even just a quarter of a percentage point .
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and main aspects that will follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus company & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for an excuse not to increase interest rates, growing uncertainty in the global market is sufficient to give them reasons to wait," she said.
There is no consensus regarding the decision to be taken by the Fed, this in itself causing instability in the financial market.
About half of economists recently polled by Bloomberg had anticipated an interest rate increase this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to postpone a key indicator of growth showing that the probability is only 30%.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed's interest rate increases, unless policy makers would soften the blow by promising that it would be a long time until the next rise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16599.85.
The momentum was triggered by expectations that Fed policy makers will keep interest rates steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if the Fed to raise interest rates at this time," said Lonski.
If Fed policy makers would do so, "should act towards their policies to avoid panic in financial markets".
Other experts said that an interest rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty related to when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on track to increase rates by 0.25% this month, the first small step toward tightening monetary conditions slow recovery that would confirm US force.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that was expecting an interest rate increase this year despite objections raised by liberals as that would require more economic progress.
Although job creation has slowed in August, increasing labor market has been strong this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest figure in more than seven years and close to the Fed considered as full employment of labor.
Earnings showed signs of growth.
And although inflation continued to not touch the central bank's annual target, Fed policymakers said that a key reason was the temporary effect of oil prices are in sharp decline.
The economy "may face higher rates and needs them, given the tension on the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson of, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the global financial markets have begun to enter the atrial later this month, after China and devalued currency.
Dow Jones industrial average fell 16% below the record peak reached in May, as investors feared that slowing Chinese economy will drag down global growth.
Market kickback somewhat this month, the Dow is now about 10% below the peak in May.
For Fed policy makers, market turmoil adds to the complex calculation timing of rate hikes.
"Without what happened in the financial markets and news of weakening Chinese economy in recent weeks, as more solid in the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a researcher with UCLA Ziman experience within the Center for Real Estate and former Fed official .
Now he expected to wait at least a month to better manage its effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty over who will be the impact on the US economy and have almost no data on which to base subsequent events in China," said Oliner.
The welfare of the global economy is one of the major interests of the Fed, so basically should not be taken into account in decision making.
But in reality, the Fed has become global monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence was huge.
The mere hint of the then President, Bernanke in 2013, the Fed could "narrow" monetary expansion earthquake triggered global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are intertwined increasingly more, it is expected that Fed officials not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at the firm managing wealth Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., Said this month that "the Fed has a history of oversized reaction to changes in the financial market which appear to be unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, voting member of the Federal Open Market, and decision making body, which has supported the growth rate, provided that such decisions 1998-99.
A financial crisis that hit Asia has led the Fed to cut the benchmark rate to 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the possibility of identifying with limited implications for US growth," said Lacker.
A year later, Fed officials have returned to the respective declines.
Fed should raise the issue of financial stability in the first place only in case of a major crisis, as the 2008 earthquake in the market, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Commission determining the interest rate of the Bank of England.
Lately stirred not rising nowhere near that level, he said.
"Surely we do not want to reach a situation to fear an increase in interest rates because markets were upset," said Posen, Chairman Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Federal Reserve Act still has the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and until you change anything in this respect, I do not think we should take action prematurely.

4 people have died after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into crowds demonstrating against the proposed new constitution of the country, an official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal According to his statements, the district police chief, over 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station, some of whom threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal claimed that police used tear gas after they fired shots into the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, they were wounded twenty police officers and five civilians.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known that can kill but are commonly used as a less lethal alternative have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the final event conducted after weeks of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group states that new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal, where ethnic group Tharus want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in clashes triggered on August 10,
when four major political parties signed an agreement for the division of the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, centrally governed country for hundreds of years.
The procedure for drafting a new constitution started in 2008, but legislators have accelerated following the devastating earthquake which killed thousands of people in April.
This week in Kathmandu, legislators voted clauses of the draft constitution and officials have said the new charter could be adopted Sunday.

Weight reduction surgery could be useful in diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight reduction surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether diabetics with mild obesity surgery live longer after weight loss than those receiving non-surgical treatments.
"We need more time to centralize data on mortality," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, car she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
For weight loss operations, also called bariatric surgery, using various methods to decrease stomach.
They reduce hunger and limits the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies were performed on morbidly obese people with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, ranging from 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal.
The BMI of less than 25 indicates that a person is overweight and those with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by visiting: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the Hospital General Min-Sheng of Taiwan have used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in sleeve - the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in individuals with mild obesity.
The average BMI in people who have undergone surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received nonsurgical treatments against diabetes remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, diabetes was completely cured in 36% and 28% partially.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured only 1% and partly just 2% of subjects.
In addition, control blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL "bad" "were generally better in the surgical group," the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
Following surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the group treated with the medical methods, it was maintained at about 8%.
But this "glycemic control" improved - reflected in improved levels of hemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared with the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), recorded considerable declines in the value of BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and have a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not show a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of people with high weight in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had a probability of about 29% lower die after 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show a survival benefit in patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it looks optimistic for people with BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is where this work is critical because it says that this surgery is safe in lower BMI group" without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start weight -to take seriously when the patient reaches BMI 27-30.
"I believe we wait too long to urge people to take this seriously," she said.
I think once you have accumulated these genetic changes they have shorted bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe might not receive all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current crisis in the Middle East are refugees.
Tibetan Buddhist leader sent out a call for end to violence in the mother countries of refugees.

He also pointed out that, although admirable response western European countries is inadequate refugee crisis situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama has praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It's great care for thousands of refugees, but we must think while long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, particularly through education in Muslim countries," he stressed.
In fact, we must think of ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
Force has never solved these problems, "he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented about the actions of George Bush after the terrorist attacks on September 11, saying that violent response from the US generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
After September 11, I sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and I said to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but used force and caused unintended consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.

Lopez said some children drink detergent intentionally while others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
YouTube videos can be watched which shows teens how to create detergent drink cheap drinks.
It seems that teenagers detergent mixed with mouthwash with alcohol to get a drink more.
Younger children may be attracted by the smell of detergent attractive.
"A child does not think that hurts him," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (for washing hands) are fragrant.
Detergents hands with strawberry, grape, orange are the most attractive for children.
The detergent contains about 45-95% of hands alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison center at the University Hospital of Kansas for Fox 4 Kansas City.

Alcoolemia179 have twice higher than the threshold at which an adult is considered legally drunk, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah stammering and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors have monitored it overnight in a children's hospital separately for signs of brain damage, because the girl fell and was hit in the head because of alcohol, said Ritchey.
"It was scary," said Ortoria Scott's mother Nhaijah, CNN.
It could be fatal to them.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use products or wet wipes and detergent hands not let the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some deaths have been associated with detergents.
In 2013, two women in Ontario have died after swallowing detergent hands containing a toxic ingredient, unreported.
Health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a substance lethal, not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in northern New York plotted to poison their teacher 'bad' 'putting antibacterial products in class, "according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to detergent hands and forbade him room to courses.
Police considered that the plan is "insignificant" and referred the matter to the disciplinary inspectorate.

If that happens, and I hope that does not happen, I will sit in a room for observers of the execution room and made Oklahoma State Penitentiary see how Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
I asked to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation came the first time in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches in question, the idea terrifies me.
So what to do?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
True, journalists can witness the executions in America, and because applications usually exceed the number of seats available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
Those elected will look impartially execution.
I can not do that.
I sit by his closest friends of Richard Glossip, in addition I have developed my own connection with him over the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two hours and a half.
I like the guy.
More often laugh when we talk.
Prison authorities say they can not be a witness and a journalist, so I will not allow me to have a notepad and pen to write down what they see.
I have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist accused of Oklahoma me on Twitter because I compromise impartiality.
Here lesson.
Tells the story of the prisoner as he wants, gain access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that "could have brought better", but it still feels wrong.
Richard Glossip not agree with some of the things I said and I wrote.
Do not tell me what to write and I would not do it even if I'd asked.
I said I can eliminate the witness list at any time.
But now he wants to be an international report that says about the subject.
He thinks that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware reporter Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, hear the series of multimedia files that you've done.
I will return here on all the details.
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van TREE make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it is very likely not be guilty of murder.
I believe with certainty that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And he will look dying from this perspective.
I can not claim to be totally objective.
To do this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you will learn how is to watch a man like him dying needlessly.
Peter Moody claims that stewards were trying to spy on and threatens to withdraw from racing
Peter Moody Racing Victoria stewards said that or tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw from the race immediately.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the Racing Victoria integrity department, saying they running a personal campaign against him being the straw that broke the camel's elimination from the race because Lady Tatai treatment administered on race day.
Moody told Fairfax Media that has always sought to do what is best for racing and that is put in a difficult situation when it comes to a positive test result for cobalt's lidar, which has no explanation.
For 18 months, he swallowed words about the statements about spies and did not want to look like "the fox not reach the grapes."
"I was not going to say anything about that aspect and remained silent a long time but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it suddenly explodes," said Moody.
We know that continued.
Sometimes you react and must bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep soundly.
I want to go with my head up and collaborating with owners want to see that I try to give them all the very best.
From the moment they begin to believe that this does not happen, you have to give up being a trainer.
At that point I have to think about what I do with my certification.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview given to racing.com the integrity said the department attempted to spy stables.
"In the last eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whose name I will say if asked - and offered to hire stables tool to provide information about the work there, "said Moody Racing.com.
Obviously it considered a cheater.
If so, then you should resign to give their all because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current Executive Director of RVL CEO, knew at the time and know today.
I would think it personal?
Is it necessary RVL begin to have a backbone and can bring to people outside trainers for what is happening in the industry?
I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Perhaps I appear.
Maybe I should take a license and get out of the way and I doubt that the statements they make now might lead to think about this option.
But I got to the point where I do not care anymore and that saddens me.
It saddens me greatly.
I put pressure on and I will cause you to make a decision.
My family supports me and can not leave.
Frustration has grown with the trainer on testing long investigation involving cobalt in LIDAR and elimination caused him to affirm that could "put their license on the table."
Moody, whose name is most often associated with driving champion unbeaten Black Caviar, labeled rule treatment of race day as "ridiculous" after applied to the feet of horses poultice mud or clay, which break the rules.
Violate races.
I need to take full responsibility for this, "he says.
One of my employees I accidentally put mud on foot.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, what has happened.
It happened on race day.
Moody could be disqualified for three months of treatment involving applying poultice race day, which stewards have opened an investigation.
It is a joke.
People who do these rules not know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules but they went too far," said Moody.

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to allegations of wrestling opponent.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism plating tactics used by his team as "distorted subjects" raised by the two favorites in the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that referees have allowed Storm players to "his wrestling" match his team won Storm nervous in the final qualifier played Friday night in Sydney.
Coach of the Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory qualifying match with North Queensland Cowboys, played Saturday night, when he called off that a "demonstration" of league rugby and said the two Queensland teams are not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy came to the defense tactics of plating addressed the team and said the players focused simply on "contact" when plate.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after the two coaches leading criticized his team, which means that they were worried that Storm will defeat them.
"And it does not stop here - we have not heard Trent Robinson to complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2 score," said Bellamy Wednesday.
I can guarantee that I have not changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, except that in the last six weeks I focused really on contact cladding and so we changed the situation.
Trent is in this position three years and obviously has a great team so it probably is not used to losing and it was a shock for him.
Funny how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea to "animate football", reminding him of his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons Bennett won his championship in 2010 playing football "boring".
Wayne speaks thrilling football.
He argued opinion and comparing the game Saturday night with our game Friday night and talked about how exciting was the game, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George has received much criticism for being a boring team and Wayne said he does not care a whit no.
But now has a team that can play what I consider as thrilling football, especially because young playmakers fast.
That kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two midfielders Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play it.
Me gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat worried tied the game with us.
Six weeks ago probably did not think of us when they thought of important matches.
Bellamy also brought out that the match between Storm and Roosters was a fierce contest tied score against the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The match of the Broncos was probably a good match, I have not seen yet, how was the score? 16-12?
Our match ended 20-18 in our game have been two attempts, this means exciting game?
Or thrilling is doing breaks and not flagging?
Plans for me are.
If you talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet.
Storm is free this weekend as they won the right to play at home or with North Queensland Cowboys, either Cronulla Sharks in the final qualifying next Saturday at AAMI Park tickets are on sale from putting next Tuesday morning.

FriendsFest: comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in serials is obvious, given that the need for men to be open is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young males by touching the tip of the past 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 years in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the unfortunate campaign against life (Campaign Against Living miserably (CALM)) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men to seek help when needed.
Friendship is the core of the struggle to success this challenge.
A recent study conducted on more than 2,000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough many friends "with a state of healthy disposition," his chances of recovery are doubled.
Similarly, for people who are not depressed, a circle of friends sane halve the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, for that friendship to be effective, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is on style rather than substance, the immediacy of response often has priority over contact with significance.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality it is the isolation that dominates.
This success surface is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - and deeply affecting our mental health.
Aul a video game billionaire inventor recently explained that money does not buy happiness even.
Friends beauty show was that it focused on this idea.
The characters were defined by work but own personality, which he showed by interacting as friends.
Humor embraces frequent Joey and Chandler, times when watching football in comfortable armchairs and passion Ross Rachel came from the fact that we know that men can relate to this situation, even if often are reluctant to explore their full feelings.
As explained social worker ... "my role to listen to people with suicidal and depressed showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who come to us do not feel able to talk with friends.
The old adage you to your own is strong, just like the feeling of being perceived as weak person if you talk openly about issues.
Friends is one series that come to mind when I try to offer several mechanisms of long-term psychological adjustment.
The series has revealed little moments of friendship between men.
As much help intervention objective, external, via phone, people arrive in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you are on this weekend in FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with full playback of filming to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends over coffee in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference it could make your friendship.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - when #FriendsFest

But if you expect someone like PSG to obtain victory by snapping his fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with new owners at national teams with a defense of five men and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive except by Nikola Djurdjic who shot past Kevin Trapp's post after 34 minutes.

This goal has removed those from Malmo hope that will rebalance the score and only a superb stop from Wiland's distance to dismiss David Luiz has maintained final score before new entrants to be terminated Ezequiel Lavezzi scored in overtime.
Malmo Norwegian team coach, Age Hareide, said later that PSG were a class above and that "Last match that I played in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, I only played league in Sweden, which amounts to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Hats off to PSG.
They did an excellent game.

I do not know who will be proposed for this function.
Miracles will.
It is important to take political decisions for this institution to function.
No man will lie to say it appears a genius who will stand in line here and will fight.
I hope that those who decide the Parliament, through their vote with great reason to choose the people who will lead TVR.
Must be people who know what is happening there, have experience and have plenty of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I do not know who will, if you ask me what qualities must have - common sense attitude to employees because it is a pile of petitions coming from employees, claims, layoffs.

Ponta accused of slander uncontrolled and irrational statements
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto tough condemned Wednesday morning, Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta statements according to which policymakers in Hungary are not "no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries fleeing refugees."
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta has lost self-control and by his irrational statements, hurting the entire Hungary," Hungarian Foreign Minister conveyed in a statement.
European politicians do not say such slanders civilized uncontrolled.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he lost support in the total domestic politics in Romania", added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wants to attract attention and sanction the behavior of some Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the EU".

As he closed his mouth Hagi contesters
Considered by many the greatest novel ever footballer Gica Hagi was tagged after retirement, as a weak coach, you may not be able to achieve high performance in the new position.
After the unfortunate experience with the national team, Steaua and Galatasaray, Hagi took over a year ago, the future role of coach Constanta team that patronize.
After exactly one year after taking over the team, King proved that it is able to transform a team that was struggling to save from relegation in the top one.
So after a year, Future recorded with coach Hagi, 16 wins, 11 draws and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of a top team that beat European Cups.
Things took on a future and better for this season, as the team reached second place in Ligue 1 with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future has the best attack in Ligue 1 with 20 goals (tied with Astra), more than double than Steaua.
On the other hand, even if the team has brought more experienced players, Hagi continued its policy of promoting young, and lately the home team emerged as Ianis Hagi name or Hodorogea.
Future policy has made the club a team to watch teams from abroad, such as Hagi sold this summer for 1.5 million - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million) and Alexandru Mitrea (Bari - 500 thousand euro ).
Along with Steaua, profitable future is the only team in Ligue 1, according to data from the Trade Registry.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can not ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
Big countries come with solutions for the entire EU, said Cristian Ghinea, a member of the college director of the Romanian Centre for European Policies.
In an interview Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea has shown that Europe can not be transformed into a fortress and pure means police will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts regarding the quality values that come with these people" .
But there are masses that have started and we can not turn history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as well as possible and to adapt them to us.
According to Cristian Ghinea, we are in a highly emotional moment, where politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes away, the Europeans are not willing to give of free movement in the Schengen area but the rules need to be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in a different era and which was not adapted to the situation now."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after the council JHA actually solved nothing?
It is clear that in accordance with EC President Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All forecasts were saying that they had the necessary votes.
Before the Lisbon Treaty, the JHA applies the principle of unanimity and any country can block any decision.
Therefore, things were minimally integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure is applied, the EC has the initiative, and the Council approve a vote of 55% of countries, namely 16, which represent 65% of the EU population.
Calculations were told that votes.
But they wanted to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive issue, rejection reactions occurred even in Germany against the policy of opening and Merkel did not want to appear in many countries as a reaction like "EU migrant sends us the head".
Therefore postponed, but the problem remains because obviously this wave creates a huge problem for Schengen governance and we will likely see big changes there in the next period.
So mandatory quotas were not really removed, but the subject was only allowed to further cool?
Yes, on the other hand, it talks about a greater involvement in the management of external borders agency Frontex, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are external border of the Schengen responsibility agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey and Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants gave the old Schengen system boundaries.
Maybe it will give the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state entering first, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece capoteaza you can not tell it's job infinitely Greece.
The problem is common.
Precisely because the problem is common, it is possible to fix without a precise mechanism, perhaps even mandatory sharing effort receipt?
No one knows exactly how they work mandatory quotas, if it comes to them.
Because it remains a problem: what to do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I do not think it will grab the top European countries to take migrants: you go in country X or country Y.
Perhaps it will reach some unique filtration centers in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications to be processed.
They are working on solutions like this.
But the problem has no simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in attempting to integrate migrants are countries with no experience as Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase current xenophobic.
The fact is we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, staying in precarious camps and who were just beginning to go to Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% have started to leave last winter's heavy Mediterranean, but next year we expect an even bigger wave.
What about these people?
My prediction is that we will get used to this problem, we will not look so catastrophic in terms of media.
Talking countries experienced smaller or larger.
Does it seem like there is any place where he managed the integration of large groups really coming from a non-European culture?
Watch Maghreb in France, Turks in Germany, they are all landlocked.
I would not go toward radical statements.
Sure their integration is more difficult than in other waves of migration, but that does not mean that integrates all.
It remained unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, UK.
But politiensti means just will not work.
To create a fortress Europe is illusory.
It has walked the mechanisms of integration into European societies.
There were some mistakes.
We have to be more demanding.
We ask these people to learn the language, try to take values, not to remain with one foot in Europe and one in their home country, bringing the rest of the family including marriages of convenience.
But imminent problem must separate these people long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration does not mean that we have to look at them as drowning in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we doubt regarding the quality values that come with these people.
And if you have an intervention in Syria, which does not believe, does not mean that the country will recover overnight, and she can go back.
Until there be solutions, see fortresses in Europe.
Borders were closed, amounted walls reintroduced border controls in the Schengen area.
European project is in danger?
European project as such, as it was built Schengen area, yes.
It was built quite minimal and arranging the rules so the pressure was too great countries in which to set foot for the first time these migrants.
Actually we circulate freely and forth, but each with their problems.
In the face of such a wave can not be so, because some countries do not face.
When there is such waves of emotion, showing that politicians will do something, but in the long run does not change much.
After the attacks in France have much more draconian anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that installs both ways.
And it is so unstable from week to week that you can not make decisions based on them.
We much talk, many bellicose statements from politicians who are under pressure at home to be virile.
And then dramatically if the child drowned in Turkey and it excites public opinion.
After going public emotion, we get back to why we have created this space, the freedom of movement that is not only for humans but also for goods.
This is true European single market.
And I do not think that the Europeans will give up this principle of libertatatii motion.
There will be other rules is different.
Schengen is now like an animal created in a different era and which was not adapted to the situation now.
As Romania has played so far in this crisis?
As a small country that believes that if he pulls his cap over his eyes and ears, the issue disappears.
In reality face waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or you say that your problem is the small country.
November's what I did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can not ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
There are no level playing big country.
Big countries come with solutions for the entire EU, good or bad, not now discuss their quality.
As did Poland.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that Romanians appetite for Schengen will greatly decrease.
President Johannis can say it's good that we have not already entered.
So we move from despair coming from a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria entering the Schengen that migrants see us as an alternative route.
Which means it's not a reason not to enter into Schengen, but to be pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen and Schengen there, but transformed in the sense that the external borders will become common responsibility will be unique rules of acceptance of migrants, unique rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum rules unique to the countries considered safe.
Ukrainian President said that after Russia moved its attention on Syria in Ukraine has not one died.
There is a link between the two outbreaks, one of Russia game?
Russia has frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being a great power means to mislead Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without financial and military effort of the Putin regime, Assad regime likely would have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to crash before his main opponent to be Islamic State.
A couple of years was a struggle between the Assad regime and secular and moderate Muslim militias, backed by Gulf and Western countries.
Then he lifted Islamic State and no longer know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia could complicate things, but can not participate in the solution.
It creates instability and chaos that can not close.
But only if you're high power and solutions.
The off-side game is just a strategy to save time.
Perhaps Putin is expected to make offers, to push his buttons to resolve the situation.
Offers do not come to the world is not convinced that he can resolve one way or the other issues created by him.
But I do not agree with the theories that say that these people are driven by an invisible hand.
Do not we see is more powerful than Putin.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the button "Like", and now preparing another social network representatives opposed the "Dislike".
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive, said on his account that this button will be available soon, informs New York Times blog.
Zuckerberg said that button "Dislike" will look more like a shade of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly.
Zuckerberg said he wants to avoid times when someone posts on your account or an important event in life, and someone else will "Dislike".
LAN users, which reached 1.5 billion active accounts have long called to have the opportunity to express negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg said that is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" to current events, such as the refugee crisis or if a death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable hitting posts Like that", said Facebook representative.
Variant a new Facebook button was not received well by everyone.
"There are already enough hate Facebook and social networks," said Atiq Haneef in Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where he was posted article on this subject.
"I'll give 'Dislike' button 'Dislike'" he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, said that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, eMarketer analyst social media company, said it is hard to imagine that one button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she says, approaching election campaign in America, and the "Dislike" would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees came to Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary has only 70 migrants Tuesday, a handful of the thousands who came in mass to its southern border with Serbia, said Gyorgy Bakondi government adviser.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia because of the flow of refugees, closing a key border crossing and announced it would build a fence on the border with Romania it reminds DPA.
The measure drew a sharp reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday said they would seal the border for those who want to go, but for those who wish to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said Serbian Minister for Refugees, Aleksandar Vulin.
Prior to impose new legislation on immigration, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said Monday.
Also, more than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa broke into Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and trying to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" office of the County Council is to drop.
Two builders, insolvency
Massive investments made here in recent years to move the institution to crumble stand because they had been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked there became insolvent during the work.
County Council Street Alecsandri will eventually crumble alone.
A year and a half since it had finalized the consolidation and refunctionalisation the building works have not reached any half.
An epic final step in the building was consumed days ago, when the National Council for Solving Complaints (CNSC) has rejected a complaint with the company that wanted to take over the project technical agreement for the work still to be executed.
The initial draft was prepared by ROMCATEL Impex SA.
After the insolvency of the builder and interruption of work, were initiated negotiation procedures without publication of a contract notice with ROMCATEL Impex, the company will update the technical project and then issuing a new tender for works.
"Negotiations have been completed but not a contract, stating that CJ would be disadvantaged as proposed institution," summed Răzvan Timofciuc represented public relations in the CJ.
CJ's decision to discontinue direct negotiations has been challenged in court by Impex ROMCATEL.
Iasi Court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which dismissed it as belated.
This does not mean that CJ can start searching for another designer.
ROMCATEL Impex has the opportunity to appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal CNSC only after a final judgment of it and could consider finding another designer.
Thus, the consolidation of the building could resume as early next year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, technical rebuilding should not take long, but we have to reach a contract.
"We are waiting to see whether CNSC decision will be appealed or not," said Timofciuc.
The consolidation of the former headquarters of the Police Headquarters Police began in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012 after works had been carried out 4.5 million.
The auction resumed contract was awarded to Moldoconstruct SA.
But the company entered insolvency and contract being terminated after it had made payments of 1.5 million.
Works have been made so far by approximately 50%.
Initially, the consolidation, refunctionalisation and attic of the building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.

Patana a tourist
A family of tourists from Iasi Cluj came to visit him, but the trip was finished with a bitter promise.
After lived experience nor my wife nor I do not want to ever set foot in your city.
Unwittingly, were hit by erroneous information leaflets, the callousness controllers Raptor and bonus, a fine "because the law says so."

Bad luck for violators of Vaslui.
Accident and had remained in custody
The trial of seven rapists from Vaslui moved, yesterday, the Court of Appeal Iasi.
Iasi magistrates judged first hearing in a closed hearing in which seven young men allegedly taunted a young woman of 18 have asked to be set free.
Before starting the actual hearing, one of the judges who had been assigned folder Iasi, Viorel Munteanu made a request for abstention, which was accepted by his colleagues at court.
The magistrate turned up this summer at Vaslui Court, where he was president of the Criminal Section, he is the one who, on April 9 upheld an appeal brought by four of the defendants, ordering placing them under house arrest.
Currently, the case is judged by a panel that includes magistrates and Geta Sandu Maricica Mititelu.
Earlier in the dossier filed an abstention and Dan Anton judge on the grounds that his daughter is in a relationship of cohabitation with one of the lawyers rapists.
The two judges decided that rapists from Vaslui to remain in custody.
Young people will remain imprisoned for at least 30 days, when the judges will re-discuss the possibility of their freedom.
Next hearing will be held in Iasi Appeals Court on October 6.
Before arriving at the Appeal Court Iaşi, the van that rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident in Păcurari neighborhood, Iasi car entering the ring.
Iveco van that transported the seven rapists were hit a Volkswagen which came on str Canta and the driver tried to turn left.

great migrations
Romania is not and will not be ready for what comes next.
But Europe?
I say this from the beginning, loud and clear: the no 7,000 refugees who should and have to naturalise Romania is in itself an insignificant number, but huge compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project .
For Romania, even proposed voluntary share of Bucharest, amounting to about 1,500 souls, far exceeds our good intentions expressed solidarity with the European Union in recent months.
Certainly, if even accept those migrants to settle in our localities, the chances of them quickly integrate into Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
I am sure they will be the first to lose their patience.
Parasitized underworld and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
Inability to integrate Gypsies them is just a trivial example.
Besides, governments of any color were not able to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, provide decent health care, collect dirt from the street, to create paid jobs honorable or -and keep its young generation at home.
Why would settle refugees in another country that runs away?
But what is particularly surprising produces much hypocrisy that is treated with such a crisis.
We face the first of hypocrisy bellicose powerful states of the EU, which demonstrates the maximum generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
Romanians fearful then comes the hypocrisy, notwithstanding the millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet support the other - the other language, another religion, another blood.
Probably for fear steal any national being.
After all, there is the hypocrisy of many migrants who, although only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, another destination not accept drain than Germany or the Nordic countries.
However, not all refugees are Syrian, and not Pakistan's war.
Also how simple it is analyzed crisis can only be derided.
Causes must be eliminated, and some argue, relying strictly on political correctness book, asking for peace and investment countries of origin of migrants.
But Romania's peace and even fall occasionally, something foreign capital in the national economy - but that did not prevent tens of thousands of Romanian to leave the country every year.
Why go?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed to us as a construction spondylitis, divided and overcome the situation.
We deplore the fact that Romania is not able to invent a project for the country, but here we nor the EU have any plans for the future.
And improvisations and threats will not help.
Then, the EU uses more if only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - freedom of movement - could be questioned because of waves of refugees crossing borders that the cheese?
At one point, the war in Syria will end.
Not migrants crisis, however.
In the following decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa for a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not, nor will ever be ready for what comes next.

EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that break your heart.
At 20 years but received a brave: the biological parents
Lost in hospital under unclear in the darkness 90s, when he was only two months old, tiny and helpless bolnăvioară, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, the same year the adoption was loosely regulated, a young ieseanca, now a beautiful blonde girl, the other day in Iaşi reunited with their biological parents in a village in the county after nearly two decades in which no one knew anything else.
Crina will turn 20 years these days, and her adoptive parents in Palermo were thought to offer him their beloved daughter a gift astounding and courageous: a visit to Romania, in Iasi, to know his past unclear.
"Ziarul de Iasi", who witnessed the search efforts of the family home after a few extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings which basically breaks your heart.
Telling reporters, emotions, moments, the statements of those involved, their responses are downright poignant and overwhelming.
Lilies story begins 20 years ago in the town of Iasi rusty when he was only two months.
Then, due to health problems, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
Home began to be disagreements between parents and the mother had to părărească residence.
He decided to keep the girl and me to send me home.
A girl stopped, and then I never knew anything.
"When I found out that I was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina grieving, the biological mother of the girl.
Crina was admitted to the hospital with her grandmother Municipal Paşcani and also when her father, Costica Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives had to separate permanently.
They have not found her at the hospital Crina
After admission, Lilies father went to work in another town, and came back after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi and father when he returned, never found her.
I think almost nine months had passed since the girl was in hospital.
"One would have thought it's abandoned," says a niece of the family.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come up with Crina Iasi and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because nobody was more interested in the fate of the child all the time, she was taken by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, who then gave it to the care of Bucium Placement Center.
They were years of abandonment and adoption were more loosely regulated compared to today's Romania.
Bucium Center was found by Italian Salvatore and his wife, a couple of Palermo who wanted to have their baby but could not.
They fell in love with blonde Crina, and after some time it had to move them off in Italy.
Little he had already almost two years, how long they lasted adoption formalities.
When I saw Crina, I felt it's our girl.
"Like my wife would have given life," he says smiling Salvadore, adoptive father, while his hand caught in the frail hand of the girl.
In the country, parents Lilies, Alina and the cost kept separate searches, each wave could.
Father asked the authorities of rust, but received no response could be where his child.
Police sent it then it may be dead, but in Iasi parents found out what was really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for it here, they told me it's gone to court in Italy, Palermo.
To look for conditions and I never had.
We prayed to God to be good.
I thought about her all the years that have passed, but there were no opportunities to walk, to find her.
"It's hard," he tells us tearfully Lilies biological mother.
However, even if years passed, parents of rust were forgotten.
In Italy, Salvatore and his wife explained to him where he comes face her past and a link to Romania.
I was young when I found out.
I think I was five or six years.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to know my parents in Romania," says delighted Crina.
Her dream was to become reality.
In March this year, Romică Ichim Chief Commissioner, Regional Director of the Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling Iasi, was contacted by an acquaintance in Italy, which explained his desire to find Salvadore Lilies biological family.
And searches have started out with a name.
After requesting that we had from our partners in Italy, we began the first steps.
I received only a name, Balcan Costica, then the town of Rust.
Soon I had activity with city hall there, and we could ask if there is the village got the name.
Then they gave me some pointers, only that the person was not found and sought after.
"It took until about a month ago up to find the girl's biological father," he explains Romică Ichim Chief Commissioner.
In total, more than three months they took authorities to find cost and Alina, especially since each was domiciled in another locality.
We started work somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of the biological parents and discussions.
"Then in September we decided that the first meeting take place," added Romică Ichim.
The weekend passed, Alina and cost and have seen first hospital halls girl lost in Iasi, 20 years ago.
Father, excited, barely able to control her tears and his hands were shaking incessantly.
Only change a few words with others.
A week before the meeting did not really able to sleep.
He was all excited, trembling.
"Like to see your baby after so many years, is something," says a niece, and she knocked cost from rust.
Lilies meeting with the biological mother and brother
In talks with his daughter to study at top universities in Italy, Costica Balcan said, among other things, that if he ever return to him in the village to come quiet: they can give you some sheep, goats , to find a man from the village and household încropească.
And her mother is nervous, cry, and think hard that something could happen to them.
I'm very nervous.
I believe that can happen.
I have seen cases on television, I thought all these years, I hoped, but I thought I could be and I like that.
I am very nervous.
If I could forgive.
I hope to visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a relationship," says Alina with big tears on her cheeks, mother Lilies, while keeping a tight hand towel.
He in hiding tears of happiness, because soon you will see her face after so long.
On the other side, Crina, who turns over a few days this month 20 years, trying to quiet a child as emotional.
Not knowing what to expect, but he sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks I'm young, but now meeting trying to gather his thoughts, because it has a lot to say, but nothing to complain about.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But eventually my parents who raised me.
A meeting will be beautiful, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," he reports Crina.

Union Square beneath the beginning of autumn, the family of Ruginoasa joins again face their destiny in Palermo.
Crina has 20 years now, finish high school, modeled on the Italian school, but may begin a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
No longer break boundaries and countries, but a barrier: that of language.
More than that, with the help of an interpreter, a local Italian owner in the center of Iasi, passed easily.
Those who managed to make it possible to say that this meeting is the first event of its kind done, and that in the future, if it appears the opportunity, will do.
It is the first event of its kind organized by such emotional, and I'm glad to be a success.

Truce with weapons leg yesterday at PSD.
Everyone and pant
PSD branch camps in Iasi concluded a truce with gun leg.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressured by the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, Iasi Social Democrats will send it a whole list of potential candidates for the position of party.
Far from being over, the war seems to be internal party just took a break to allow combatants to catch his breath.

A judge refused Iasi Vaslui file rapists because of concubinage
Seven young people from Vaslui convicted of rape reach the Court of Appeal Iasi today.
Vasluienii sentenced to between five years and eight months to eight years and four months today will present arguments concerning their freedom, after the trial court, Vaslui Court, established their incarceration immediately after sentencing.
The case was registered at the Court of Appeal late last week, magistrate Dan Anton by request of abstention, admitted by his colleagues.

Luke defends Burada Ovidiu Silviu, who received the largest penalty in this case.
How motivated judges sentence
Last weekend, the magistrate from Vaslui Court which sentenced seven young motivated sentence.
The motivation judge speaks defiant reaction to the defendants, but also those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among the public.

Corbyn, Brexit's and Europe's future
Economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity of which have enjoyed in recent decades can not continue the same in the coming years.
To Saturday probably knew few people in Romania who is Jeremy Corbyn.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many are wondering to what extent we can affect the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a position decision.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of Labour after the war.
Marxist said anti-monarchist (asked at one point Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to bring the royal family from Buckingham Palace), an anti-American fierce and a supporter of Vladimir Putin (was otherwise regular guest to comment on political events by television channel "Russia Today"), and terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons out of NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who considered at the time the killing of Osama bin Laden as a true tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable United States.
The pattern of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, anti-austerity miracle solutions.
Things kind that he said and you promised and in Greece Tsipras gave up when the chest with the real world and economic standards.
The economic program of the new Labour leader provides, inter alia, renationalisation massive money printing as a solution for financing development projects and coverage of generous social benefits.
Sure, some might ask why money printing solution is not widely adopted around the globe, we then have a general global prosperity !, but who would further hinder such details.
Sure we can to charge the blood bankers, become a kind of enemies service of the left, but from what we have seen so often in the past, not only in former communist countries or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, early Mitterrand and Hollande's mandates.
Additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous pledges, uncoated, made by populist demagogues.
As well warned Margaret Thatcher, "Socialism problem is that at some point ends other people's money."
Few give a real chance to reach Jeremy Corbyn ever prime minister.
In the early 80s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, which however was not as extreme as newly beliefs party leader, failed miserably in the elections.
And then there was still a working class in Britain, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And unions were significantly more influential now.
Under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominating the workforce as a whole, and have made extensive automation industry is massive need highly qualified labor, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even in opposition, he can influence important developments that may affect us directly.
In its latest Financial Times believes that the number Corbyn's election increases the chances Brexit's or Britain out of the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's Union membership.
In the eyes of radical left Brussels is international capitalism agent and a promoter of globalization which imposed austerity poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas expressed by the radical right, anti-immigrant rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that shake up the EU reach an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decided in the referendum, which would take place until 2017, leaving the Union capital loss symbolic for the whole European project and faults deep created therein crisis Euro and now that of refugees, between North and South between East and West, leaves room for most worrying scenarios.
The more so since for a number of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (the Berlin anyway becoming increasingly dominant player).
True, the British business environment, the City, are strong advocates of remaining EU country.
But today's Europe is not the past.
There is resentment that grow in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, recently we even had a sample in cludes Jean Junker's speech, tends increasingly to take major decisions over the heads of the great majority of Member States in consultation with a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And this happens while the electoral support for anti-system parties, anti-immigration, eurosceptic are at the same time increase dramatically across the continent.
In other words, negatively charged emotional climate reached higher levels than ever before.
Hence the conclusion he draws Financial Times when assessing the chances Brexit community.
The pro-EU is based on a cold calculation that is based on the national interest.
If voters will decide the brain, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current policy.
Or, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we will see a more pronounced integration in the euro zone, which will push most of the states in the region and on the outskirts interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feed their populist rhetoric of frustrations accumulated oocidentale companies.
Economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity of which have enjoyed in recent decades, generous social benefits, can not continue the same in the coming years.
Under the pressure of explosive crisis dual Eurozone - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that did not take into account only political ambitions integrationist, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, turmoil on the continent , EU internal tensions will increase in intensity and can greatly affect Romania's situation.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our top political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brancusi, peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help?"
Brancusi: "Take the broom shop!"
The great sculptor had a big dream: to be somebody, to get famous, to hear about it worldwide.
Hiding behind its reputation but something almost forgotten today, when we delivered millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.
That something has a name.
It's called "toil".
Why write about Constantin Brancusi?
What is there to say, really?
Figure has appeared on banknotes.
And recently, a prominent bank in Romania has hired an actor to play a clip advertising.
Brancusi money produces and delivers nearly 60 years since no longer with us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and avenues named after him.
Incidentally, even the author of this text dwells on one of these streets.
And, when she goes out with the offspring, hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, Brancusi".
The country is crowded with statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brancusi's infiltration capacity is huge one.
Neither the Communists have failed to extirpate the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotations scattered throughout the Internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and share sites.
And then again, I would have to say, writing about this man?
Viewed from the pile of books and articles that attempt to reconstruct destiny, Brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are people who say that if you have not had the luck to be born in any big city in a wealthy family at all, your chances for success in life are almost zero.
Brancusi's life is perfect counterexample.
And perhaps here would be a key.
Perhaps here should start following text.
With one sentence, no matter how they are detestable.
Forget the stupid success stories, which are delivered daily in newspapers and on television.
Look carefully at the figure of this man.
Want to know how to succeed in life, like today, he heard a whole world?
It's easy.
He worked his whole life for someone.
That made.
Constantin Brancusi was born on 19 February 1876 in Hobiţa, a small village from Peştişani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
It is the fifth child of Mary and Radu Nicolae Brancusi.
Although came from a family of wealthy peasants, Brancusi lead a modest life, but one who had to pick the landmarks that will guide her artistic vision later.
Remembering childhood and the places he grew up artist had to confess, in a meeting with Petre Ţuţea, Paris, 1933: "Back then life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people going, happy life patriarchal.
Everything went quiet from one season to another.
And you know why things have changed?
Civilization great city has come down to us.
But Brancusi's childhood was far from idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these first years of life is extremely suggestive combination of purity and violence that have marked his years in the future sculptor hometown.
The timing is reproduced in "Brancusi. A Biography" by Alexander Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brancusi was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when it was brandy "boiler", aiming at those who tasting liquid to see if the process is conducted properly, Brancusi overall catch a moment of inattention.
He fills his cupped hands with brandy and drink in one gulp.
Cade sleep almost instantly.
Early humans noticed only after several minutes.
Mom panics, then hysteria, believing that her son died.
Towards evening, when the father, Roger, returning from living together musicians, it's desperate signs visible from afar who awaits him breathless.
The party immediately turns into mourning.
Father is already thinking to burial.
Yet one finds it good to a call Baba Brânduşa, doftoroaie and maid of Brancusi.
Brânduşa check baby's breath, then put them under the nose of horse dung, collected from around.
The child sneezes stronger.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep on drunkenness, joy, party with musicians and continues with more force.
The next day, father and son meet orchard.
Radu Constantin Brancusi puts to gather some twigs and bring it to him.
Father child puts his head down and with canes to the boy, knocking him to remember.
And while he feels stinging blows, Brancusi has little revelation that the world can also be seen from another perspective and things around that may arise overturned.
Especially the sun's position, different from the known, makes him wonder, as old age have to recognize, if not himself attend the star's disorder.
Was the sun as troubled as his father what had happened ?.
Currently, the city is not working
Lawmaker calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent Deputy Viorel Blaj appealed to the PSD and PNL to cease infighting and to shift the agenda to the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is great and so divisive.
I saw nothing in the 2012 USL projects to continue.
No highway or regional emergency hospitals, just as politicians have argued see possible sites according to real estate interests.
Let a little politics aside, to gather and talk.
Currently, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with internal war, you have no time for those who elected you," said Blaj.
He said that the current political class has disappointed voters Iasi, the consequence will be very little presence at the upcoming local elections, at around 30%, representing virtually parties loyal electorate.
Also, MP believes that voters will focus increasingly towards the traditional parties, expressing reservations about the new political initiatives, such as the party "For Iaşi" which will be released today.
Local parties have little chance not only to break the will of the electorate the right, not from the PSD.
Such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually right.
"It crumbles further right, which is not good for anyone, neither for PSD," said Blaj.
He said it is not interested in a candidate for the upcoming local elections, denying rumors of his intention to join the race for City Hall.
I said I do not want to run for any local function.
I think about whether to continue as an MP in the next term.
I tried to call the unit in Iasi and hallways talks with other lawmakers, and I was accused that I want to do my image.
I do not want, but we can not continue.
"If people voted for us does not mean we are stupid to vote if you do not see anything," said Blaj, which found that the main reason that the electorate is not interested in politics is hypocrisy elected.
A colleague of Tătăraşi said that not enough money and have to go by bus.
Let us not be hypocrites.
No low cost.
Sometimes I am ashamed to raise money from the cashier.
Outgoing I will report everything I spent outside of the cabinet salaries and maintenance.
It happened to pick up in a month and 30,000 lei, although returns transport, accommodation and other.
"Let's say that an MP is not enough money is pure hypocrisy" concluded Blaj.
