Most of her recent 11 national survey Donald Trump showed leadership in double digits, and some of them the chance to ask the Emperor candidate real estate really begins.
Of course, it's early election cycle.
None can win the Republican nomination race of Trump.
It was at this time in 2011, experts say Rick Perry caused the rise the rise of Herman Cain, for which they expressed, both single even a State did not win the nomination process.

Thanasi Kokkinakis, Tennis Australia President Steve Healy is supported by
Thanasi Kokkinakis behavior deserves more than criticism for the credit.
Tennis Australia President Steve Healy Thanasi Kokkinakis friend Nick Kyrgios around according to Knight last storm was accidentally injured party deserves more than praise and criticism.
Normally referred to as "Special K", which is a member of the talented young Kokkinakis, Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters Kyrgios, shameful way butter does not take kindly to himself because he found under the spotlight.
In Cincinnati challenging the qualifying match played in the afternoon, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison two goals lines by leaving Harrison found the following statement: "Wawrinka, came upon that of boy Kyrgios, I gotta go."
In the most recent U.s. Open upset potentially Richard Gasquet's racket to seen while cracking Kokkinakis, Healy by loyal.
The young actress currently in Glasgow along with Sam Groth in the semifinals of the Davis Cup against Britain, Bernard Tomic's vying for the second singles behind the mission.
Healy "Quite enthusiastic, I feel like we were a little taken is think about the discussion of Thanasi", he said.
When blocked in the United States loses racket broke and but disappointing he's not the first player to hear the racket, and I know that Kim Thanasi also is aware enough to be repaired should be proud of it.
But in reality in the United States, Harrison and others with highly provocative was doing pretty well yourself and under the circumstances I think he deserves a lot of credit.
I have a great family, a great team around him, and I think it's a little too over.
Although extremely mature 19-year-old, he works hard and he's adjusting the team, there's nothing wrong with other players in the locker room are covered with pretty respect, challenging training, a mature young and extremely balanced, and in my opinion deserves to be judged on their own criteria.
Healy is also important to draw Kyrgios, supported the decision to see nice; Starting from Friday, the right for "mutual decision" but to return to the team as a long term Canberran boilerplate support began to explain that.
Healy, "first of all interested in contention around the team is not fully [Kyrgios] we want to focus on the game," he said.
And according to me, Nick, F ederer and Murray as stated by people like children rose too fast, growing in the public eye and made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism it receives, but we are trying to support him, and understand the consequences of their actions, we are trying to help and sometimes is not under the spotlight, I think the best thing for the team and it is appropriate that he thinks in depth.

But Clinton's supporters on the other candidates rather than have their choice of more solid ideas.
Since the CBS News last month that Clinton is losing ground to between a series of demographic groups, on the other hand, Sanders ' have some gains.
Clinton by a large margin among women and moderates ahead but this difference is closing.
Men's support fell to a great extent between and 5 points behind only Sanders himself.
Clinton, the democratic voter advantage has evaporated under the age of 50 and he and Sanders is no longer equal.
But Clinton in terms of elderly voters haka by a large margin.
Last month Clinton, Liberals was moving in front of the two-digit digits with Sander but now Sanders 5-point lead in this group.
About half the Democratic voters at the national level, the party's nominee in the event that passionately support Clinton.
A quarter are supporting some conditions of 15 percent will support it only if a candidate for other parts.
Does not support a six per cent cut of Clinton.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton supporters in particular tend to support her passionately available.
Clinton is currently even more mixed opinions between those that do not-just a quarter can support her passionately.
Democrats 48 percent support to Clinton with passion when you specify less than the Republican candidates running ahead Donald Trump speaks about (35 percent).
Clinton's supporters why they would like Clinton to be nominated when asked open-ended questions about the first answers is the right experience (16 per cent), the idea of a woman President when it came to selecting anymore (13 per cent) and is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also expressed in his relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Disorders to be conciliatory and selectable, also specified criteria.
As a Vice President with the potential for the Presidency, Democratic voters have 57 percent to be his race may want to see, but one third cut in this way.
Demoktrat is the second candidate for the party elections to voters when asked what happened, Biden top ranks.
More than half of Clinton's supporters are according to Biden's clear margin belt Sander second choices might be.
Biden, the Democratic Nomination is not entered in the race, Hillary Clinton is growing supremacy Sanders; Biden is not a race, a race with 20-point level is rising 30 points Biden.
All five Democratic voters 50 percent chance to win the general election Clinton sees it as the best candidate; but that figure last month came down from 78 per cent level.
Although this point of view when looking at second because Biden a lot behind, but it serves as the percentage of the candidate can be selected.
The most important thing a candidate again when asked about Democratic voters as to what topics can be chosen keeping in front of.
A Democratic voter in similar fashion last month candidate or candidates can not be considered a candidate for this primary voters do not appear.
Democratic candidates, or candidates for some of the main primary voters of his own party, the characteristic performs well in between.
The majority is Clinton, Sanders and Biden, honest and reliable, also people with strong leadership qualities.
Biden in terms of honesty between all three, the first in line when it comes to powerful Clinton leadership.
Thirty percent of voters according to the Democrat Clinton is not honest and trustworthy, this half of Sanders (15 percent), while 27 percent say the same for has no idea about this.
Democratic voters also in General Clinton, in line with their ideology to Sanders and Biden.
Quarter of the Democratic electorate in all criteria, Sanders has no idea about.
During the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, personal e-mail address and server for his use of the questions most Democratic voters while still satisfying the description on the subject and his opinions are not affected.
But this is the General American public opinion is a different story.
Half of Americans are satisfied with his explanation now only a third of them satisfactory.
The views of the public on this issue in March, shortly after receiving the problem under scrutiny.
Most Americans e-mail general opinions about the contention of Clinton that says, on the other hand, according to 36 percent of the increased negative ideas.
These are generally Republicans, and more than six in 10 people Clinton says deterioration of opinions.
Clinton, although his own party voters by honest and reliable on this issue among voters registered as well as in General is still a problem: only 32% while her honest and reliable that figure last month eight points, 15-point drop since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't find him honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters in the whole country ' I don't find honest and reliable Trump.
However, both Clinton and taking good notes about Trump's leadership.
Among the six candidates participating in the test Biden, Carson and Bush received the best scores about honesty.
More often, you find honest Sanders is most like in Carson does not have an opinion about him.
351 numunelerdeki margin of error 6% Democratic voters received points.

What will happen when the Fed boosted interest rates?
Interest rates rising bull market climbs, whether bond proceeds to tumble the decline in the economy.
We know that.
What we don't know is how much all this will continue whether or how long.
History, especially in the economy, the timing provides very little information about.
The decline, the first interest rate rise after 11 months as the decline in such a short time, there have been 86 months it took, too.
The us Fed's increase in interest rates, aggressive, although not all the time, usually in response to economic and financial assets.
U.s. Federal Reserve officials, IE not when investors began interest rates also should focus on the process of normalization will strongly highlights how long so.
Is a variety of variables.
However, as a result, market participants, interest rate jitters might think it was overstated.
Capital Economics Global Chief Economist Julian Jessop in a note to clients, "the global financial crisis the Fed's first interest rate increase since several of the by the end of the era of ' cheap money ' to be pointed that it is inevitable that interpreted as," he said.
On the contrary, U.S. interest rates gradually return to normal than we expect, but still most of the lower level is the seismic pulse dreads.
Still, we can't say the effects will be.
Based on past trends, some areas of the economy that could react as follows:
As can be seen in the past months on the market, boosting interest rates for a while, things to expect the policies of balance.
Interest increased, the more specific the influence at the time.
What the Fed increase would be a new investigation after Deutsche Bank analysts, "the first of interest return on Equity increasers that are seen as the next 12-24 months hesitation trend, which reflects the monetary policy could hear that pause."
Nuveen asset management analyst Bob Doll's, according to a recent analysis, share in Barron's market more save the last 35 years usually sharp rise-around 14%-250 days in the wake of the interest rate increase is moving in a straight line (average 2.6% increase) and 500 days then back to normal in the last six cycles of average of 14.4 per cent '.
Increase the impact of interest Deutsche, shares the next stages of the cycle belirginleşip returns to face wards.
Regressions are bugs are a fact of life, but economic interest rate increase also helps them.
The fed, up to date, will speed up previously existing non-regression is facing some situations.
Most striking is the Fed interest rate increases of the gross domestic product to be at the lowest level ever.
According to Deutsche Bank, since 1950 in the nominal interest rate increases that occur on 118 from year to year, the gross domestic product to 4.5 percent only twice dropped below.
Although the 3.6 percent the second quarter level of 2015 took place, though, according to the Atlanta Fed by minimal permanent situation is expected in the third-quarter 1.5 percent.
According to Deutsche, the interest rates on such a sensitive economic climate could be risky and increase "this time will be any different" can lead to the question.
Is the Fed interest rate increase a year on it is worth noting that the market participants waiting for this week, will end on Thursday at a meeting of the Federal open market Committee.
Most of this meeting, the FOMC's strategist and Economist believe approve an increase, though, points to the probability that only 25 percent of futures trading.
The report, "the research since 1950, to present a rising trend all increments cycles Super cycle beginning recovery in gross domestic product, then decline before reaching peak quickly," he said.
On the contrary, this is the worst that occurred at a time when the instance affected by unprecedented to slow a recovery.
The current cycle, the Fed's last was the longest expected since affected by loop-the longest loop in a record 35 months, and in the current loop is 74. is currently in progress.
Beklenmesiyle fixed income market rate hikes also destabilizing and tidiness looks to have any semblance of equity '.
The main difference is that the effect of the Fed policy changes course, bonds faster than in shares.
When bond first increase/decrease in the loop returns doesn't change direction now.
Interest rate is at the end of the cycle yield falls instantly, "Deutsche said.
The increase in interest, according to Charles Schwab strategists have longer and shorter term bonds will flatten by bringing benefits between slope.
We typically use this high income bond in the analysis are performed better in an environment such as Schwab analyst Kathy Jones said, but "we have to be careful about reaching still benefits," he said.
Interestingly, Jones Fed policy expectations of the market now thinks it's adapted from.
"In addition to a decrease in the strength of the dollar and inflation expectations, market is tighter monetary policy have been organized according to various signals", he wrote.
Rising short-term interest rates, yield curve, credit spreads widened and increased volatility in the market, with all the FED'S policy-sıkılaştırdığı specifications.
Broad terms, companies in the United States, most of the jobs that interest rates are going up and they're going to win because the local products more attractive.
Owes multinational corporations will be worse, because the global market increased dollars will make more expensive products, and it will be even more expensive debts.
Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report prepared for the customers "date, ' high quality ' stocks at the beginning of such an increase might indicate a reduction in performance," he said.
Companies with strong balance sheets have the 1994, 1999 and 2004 average rate increases of 5 percent with weak bilançolu ones.
Fluctuating high capital income and low stocks, the companies also lower-quality opponents (percent) 4 (percent) 3 average.
Debt will become a big deal.
According to Goldman, companies with a high percentage of floating exchange rate debt to suffer most.
Except for the gross stock market game, consumers also increased from $ rigours.
Although experts are how fast will hold different opinions, can I get an even higher gains from profitable tasarrufçular.

Of course David Cameron The Lorax, knows better than this?
Each parent is something he learned as quickly as this: your child is when you love a book, it would not take much of your time learning almost by heart.
It seems that if you are not David Cameron.
Child care is a holiday for the programmer by the supplier of the favorite children's book when asked about what happened to the Prime Minister, The Lorax, Dr. Seuss's 1971 environmental Tales from on.
In a message published on the website of the company SuperCamps that it was a difficult decision, Cameron said: "funny, charming, creative and powerful message we skip all the content of this book, which is an image or message, I like to read to my kids because the host."
So far everything is fine, until Cameron's supposedly wrote something about the contents of the book but the fact that the contents of the text in the original fairy tale to inflate new characters and details are added as paragraph summarize the book's 2012 film version.
No all is nature, even the weather is metallic walls and green city Thneed-Ville to a kid named Ted, win the heart of your dream girl Audrey for his wishes to accomplish your desire to see a real tree, he writes, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, and that doesn't include a love tale story.
This gives you that in case you suspect if enough, Cameron treats text aspect of İnternet movie library with The very brief summary text similarity of Lora film, which begins as follows: "everything, even the weather is a commodity and artificial walls green city Thneed-Ville, a boy named Ted win the heart of your dream girl Audrey."
Is a competent parent according to Cameron's claim, the local environment of a young boy with no name, also named the book the Lorax Barua, Barua and "trees, speaking on behalf of" the creature despite the protests of greedy, cut trees, Abdo-Oren Once-s is the main topic of the book, ye heard how destroyed oblivious doesn't seem likely he would.
Most likely this is a weak public relations work, an order for his servant remitted, which is apparently The Lorax, read a child is one of the 20 consecutive times.
A presidential spokesman, is intended that Cameron's choice of text from his Office said.
SuperCamps text available from Cameron's staff confirmed, but other than that, an interpretation that was not found.

Alastair Cook's team may be more than three years experience, but they've got a good batting line of rotating and collective understanding of the game is strong; This does not improve the wounds of 2012, only provides some youth-induced optimism.
Ball game is developing as a game-turning and fair, Moeen Ali Rashid, a Trial level quality is unknown, even though it represents the option attack.

Adam Lyth's decision to expel, Yorkshire head coach analyzed for me as it's a tough call.
Seven Attempts was against two good horses up in extreme conditions and simple but the inevitable truth is that cricketers are judged based on the outcome.
For example, Joe had no question mark about the Root, in the case of the announcement to be made soon because-as I said earlier-it was their best election, players.
After a few 50-issue series that could see of his career but Lyth self-determination.
Yorkshire tries more for another opportunity to catch.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss, although showing the best performance praised the attitude of the player which doesn't surprise me; first of all he's a team guy.
The rating of a Trial strike particularly hard to answer the question of how long it takes.
Lyth-like Sam Robson before him-it took seven caps, on the other hand, Nick Compton took nine.
Only the Compton rövanşlı match.
Quality you can feel only gripe Jonathan Trott can go first to the Caribbean to England-Lyth's peak form-however this wasted opportunity of the past.
Alex Hales is coming and in my opinion a high-level hitter.
X-factor is in the nature of a cricketer, and at the beginning of this season that Trent Bridge pitch against us in when we saw in Yorkshire the number 236.
At least the same opportunity must be taken to before but this of course depends on the formation of a team in the United Arab Emirates.
Moeen's, four quick's obtaining extra game while turning so it will Cook by opening shot worked and I'm not against it, the idea of making.
I don't understand why a hitter to do a shot here, and this left already as conservative, showed how good cricketer.
Moeen was the city do for Worcestershire, but saw a 3 number for them and there's no difference.
Former teammate Justin Langer for the first 38 Trial first before the exit in 2001, played in the fall.
Three hundred series immediately snatched up and looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes as the backup game-turning to the team and what I do with it is limited as an impressive young man surprised me in the talks.
Average raw statistics-shot 31 people and the ball 35 average-you can see and you might think a punt but don't have a lot of game-turning, which removes your hands and player selections made from the young ones.
You will learn a lot on this tour.
A few crafty their coach from the team away, England team seems to have done the plugin.
Mahela Jayawardene's Sri Lanka a travesty to Try for an ingenious measures the appointment as a consultant.
He's one of the most charming of the game; in all circumstances and all attacks will bring a lot of experience acquired with them.
Paul Collingwood coming in for the white ball of the tour and both energy and gives a series of brutal game scheme.
Want to get her all the time, whether it is international cricket player was born in the world of dreamy, coaches and a guide like Mahela.
New voices in the locker room sometimes, even what is said before messages can bring the team a iletse innovation.
Colly's Durham teammate Ben Stokes to one-day games against Australia to Root dinlendiriliyor, was given a similar break and I have no problem with it.
Although not everyone agrees, plans, those who choose coaches and players by being done.
And you must remember that depending on the results of their work, such as the players.
Such decisions are never easy.
If the economy's stagnant until 2017 Brexit camp can win
David Cameron's Britain in the EU strategy for the renegotiation of the half-cooked to keep is getting worse every day and this is Jeremy "Yes or no?" The labour party leadership selection according to Corbyn or TUC on Tuesday despite European outraged about that.
Foreigners also have the Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat recently, punk, some Member States do not have their own kinds of reasons completely steeped in the EU, to crises that they don't want, most of Britain's only yourself and disruptive separatist concessions the Treaty changes from the old agenda.
TUC, Brighton's annual meeting does not want them into vulnerable to social protection.
Even Dave and George's own agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor, the capitals of foreign countries interested in the Summit or join you folks out there in front of famous monuments in bilateral meetings there, whether or not take pictures of Notables they own, then go back to their country have gathered allies for reform.
This is all about me.
Berlin "leave Us with France," an outward-looking British Europeans in EU tent friend more and more short-sighted some capitals and the Minister and officials do not lick us to a point where our mold anymore, he said.
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel discreetly and lucid an ally, although 10 years in power, and Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl's (16) as in the example case comes down to is that we want to leave power.
François Hollande, re-election in 2017 in France or face to face with the change of power.

To prevent separation of Scotland from the Uk to exercise should use Selfie to show the efforts of these countries to the British not so unlikely because he doesn't want it too because most have separatist tendencies.
So, some of the Ministers, the Scottish National Party, in the style of the United Kingdom's 2017 referendum campaign during this situation isn't going to help speed up the process of deliberate expressions may be the plans to Brexit; my friend says.
"I wouldn't have been a negotiated" and "Britain will benefit from the renegotiation didn't achieve anything."
The Europeans, how much previous experience of the Fleet Street Press barons, oligarchic exploiting what they know EU opponents because they weren't like this in time, Tony Benn 2-to-1 compared to a 1973 to 1975 referendum confirming our entry were a source of inspiration.

In fact, Tony Blair is mostly about them he was thinking about the same things, only a horny gorilla in a cage trapped him for lunch and tea, after not giving bananas to feed should distract you.
In fact, the idea of the referendum Cameron bright against Miliband, Blair was also Blaircı about, as Blair, the French and Dutch votes him out card uses the EU Constitution by revoked in 2005 gave the principle compromise.
The press never forgave him in this regard.
But on Monday, Westminster sıvazlayan my back friendly in-itself not the time to lose me now I'm saying-Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock, then and now, which consisted of an error in the ' 80s the boycott strategy Murdoch seems to be under danger of adoption.
It will take time, though, not with me, especially with the media on Sunday, with Andrew Marr on BBC seat allocated to develop a consistent strategy in communication.
Corbyn's official position in Europe as developing nicely.
Reformdan says he wants us to stay in the EU a past.
UKIP's tend to most people outside the hostile and conservative supporters of the Fiery Little İngilterecilik that says Yes.
Already, "a Benn, but not the Bennite" Hilary Benn's radio and television this week that's what he said, because a naïve way Corbyn's John McDonnell's Shadow Chancellor cast as it is a bad idea to exclude forced himself to.
That's me in the ' 70s, his father's infidelity to his friends in labor on tv Cabinet, the struggle forward on gitmeyişini and most dramatically, the Cabinet reminds me of the task.
Hilary's challenge was more attractive.
But "Benn's words-" no matter what "to fight to stay, McDonnell said what JC made special meeting Monday night at the lord said it was the same with the lawmakers.
Considering also touching me, Corbyn's from try to forward-on the whole, simpering image in an age of 24/7, regardless of the TV and in particular, paranoia and betrayal in the social media bed post continue to maintain the importance of discipline.
McDonnell has said, the support of the labour party in the referendum Cameron to guarantee difficulty in Europe, allowing you to remove.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But Corbyn's Bennite about EU membership, McDonnell and siege economy and anti-geçiştirmeleri compatible with the capitalist history is now just slightly different öğretisel of a cornerstone of narcissism is left-wing opponents squabble among special is not a debate.
As with the NATO geçiştirmesinde about-Tom Watson, the JC's determined campaign to leave do-foreign diplomats and their leaders in the country to which they will have to deal with to one mana.
They are also skeptical voters why Paris or Berlin, while all of them can go to waste political capital about concessions to Britain lose?

Experts say United Kingdom Public Health e-cigarette research criticize the
The researchers, funded by the Government agency, that has a connection with the tobacco industry a 12-person meeting with e-cigarettes, smoking allegations that 95% less harmful.
British medical journal (BMJ) by experts, United Kingdom Public Health (PHE) e-cigarette uses the evidence in the report about the Lancet joined to criticize.
PHE examination in detail of the "evidence" is defined as "landmark" report released last month.
But some researchers questioned the integrity of the data and some experts and drew attention to the connection between tobacco industry.
The Lancet medical journal concluded that the main based on last month's editorial PHE "exceptionally flimsy base" was targeted.
BMJ claims that two other researchers wrote in "you built on sand or rock".
London School of Hygiene and tropical medicine, Professor of European public health Martin McKee, a Professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool and Simon Capewell şunnu said: "the basic principle of Public health policy is based on the evidence of events."
V. PHE's "the best available estimate e-cigarette smoking is approximately 95% less harmful" claim that the evidence and based on a thorough review of modeling of the expectations.
The fact that different products contain nicotine, they hurt for a synthesis of opinions to create a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) gathered together to develop the model for 12 people from a meeting; the results of the meeting are summarized in a research article.
McKee is one of the sponsors of the meeting and Capewell, General Manager, previously an independent research receives funding from British American Tobacco to EuroSwiss Health reported a company, he said.
Its also a sustainability report confirm the public health promotion document of the BAT, he said.
One of the 12 meeting of the e-cigarette is receiving funding from the manufacturer informed but the cigarette company Philip Morris International advance reported that funds received from libraries.
How to select members of the Panel was not given that information, but these include some of the article reporting an industry Fund e-cigarettes including some giants of the known.
Some other people who were present at the meeting is not recognized with expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was attended by the person in charge of tobacco in PHE.
McKee and wrote in the research article "Capewell, group of people, effectively" many many "criteria" lack of concrete evidence about the damage of the product is accepted.
However, none of those links or constraints PHE report there has been insufficient research.
McKee and Capewell, "e-cigarette is children or non-smokers to smoke for people who do not have any evidence that a transition to a" claims that are too early, he said.
PHE direktörüi in health and welfare Prof. Kevin Fenton, the BMJ claims in earlier answers, he said.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
A lifetime smoker is one of two people dying from this addiction.
All the evidence e-cigarettes are compared to small health risks caused by pointed out, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
Have a clear duty of PHE: public disclosure, especially compared with tobacco losses at a time when a lot of confusion about the evidence does not show details of shows and inform about.
It is almost a year from an illness linked to smoking 80000 people dying and the £ 2 billion a year to the NHS smoking e.
The evidence available-although the risk-free e-cigarette smoking caused only a small fraction of the damage comes to move-putting out a clear national responsibility.
Previous Channel 4 Chief, said the BBC should leave EastEnders
Previous Channel 4 Chairman Luke Johnson as the BBC's EastEnders and The Voice said to quit and advertising programs run competitors to hit programs such as arrays of Albert Square "to give their right arm," he said.
Johnson, the only other British broadcasters free licenses by the kind of programs which should be used to make, he said.
The BBC, the maximum rating of the opponents in the ranges field valued programs have a smaller audience, against the group by the public service monitoring programs such as channels to put on BBC4.
Tony Hall, the BBC's Director-General of the Organization to cooperate more with other organizations having said what he wanted; Johnson to create a bond with the BBC, Channel 4, on your own time that try failed for six years is a way, he said.
Johnson, the BBC's future during a query, the House of Lords Communications Committee ", which can be explicitly subsidized by competitors of the BBC programs struggling with the idea of order and publish," he said.
Medium or long term, I'm not sure that's a good idea if you proceed with the license fee application, output at least what others have done or ordered reduction in programs.
The range of the Voice, primetime broadcasts because the future is to ensure broad support as possible inside.
The idea is based on the idea that no one else would hold that this ridiculous and clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "without the help of funds that can be the cause of declining-rate programs to be funded with a tax, I understand.
The Voice is another one of EastEnders and is actually being done within the company.
To be honest, other channels give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how public service broadcasts.
I don't think this eksilte at the BBC.
Channel 4 in 2004, is a series of entrepreneur who manages until 2010 Johnson, "the people here ever taken advantage of and support for these employees to guarantee long term this approach as the best way to see" the BBC accused trolling ratings.
The BBC's most popular programmes such as EastEnders, BBC comments on programs to offer to sell MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, uses the previous Sky Governor Tony Ball repeats of comments.
Johnson the BBC's more affordable public service programmes on BBC4 here and went to audience measurement cannot be done but their meets and license fee income have tax forgiveness 4 billion pounds for show piety about the task of providing the ground to continue to discuss, he said, and added: "We also, of course, no one is tracking all of these faint programs."
Will anyone never trace them to spaces.
Add the license fee, Johnson said the Committee "provides the best benefit from you guys, in terms of contacts to invite to find a system more regressive.
Of course, all of you, all of us, we think, is a great value at £ 150 a year, but 150 quid is a lot of money for people who don't do the cause of too much wonder whether BBC izlememeleri.
At the same time offering evidence to the Committee earlier on Tuesday, Sky and Channel 5 Governor David Elstein, the BBC's "information, to educate and to entertain," said it had to revise its mission for Reithian.
Some of the BBC's output had been categorized officially as education-1% of it's TV-out and said ' I-0.1% of the radio and public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada it should be and that it was to promote "information, lighting and training".
Partnerships, a handful of the BBC's TV but Elstein, shown in ProMS and do something about all of them online to ensure the monitoring of advertising should enter into cooperation with the publishers, he said.
' Sonogenetics ' can be controlled by brain cells, it makes the sound waves
In the thread we're hit with their Sonic vibrations of the Wolf now seems they changed how.
Scientists sound wave bursts with controlled genetically modified they raised the nervous systems of maggots.
Tiny yarn wolves people cannot hear high pitched sound with the vibrations hit the moment they change direction.
Cross sound-wave vibrations responding to membrane channels to carry genetically altered scientists are forced to motor nerve cells by activated.

Researchers maggots have proved the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, he said; Thus a series of ultrasound brain, heart and muscle cells can be used to activate the outside of the body.
The Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, a researcher from Sreekanth Chalasani Guardian this procedure to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease one day people's brains into electrical vibrations of the intrusive procedure that is deep-brain stimulation can take place, he said.
Yarn wolves mostly, they don't react beyond sound, but with a liquid that contains microscopic bubbles Chalasani moments which they react in.
Strengthens cross-sound waves and bubbles found so that makes them go through of grubs.
Enhanced sound beyond the waves, found some worm cells membranes and TRP-4 ion channels called structures.
According to a report published in nature Communications, sound waves that ion channels opening and activating the cells on which they rely.
Audio controlled with yarn to create cross-wolves, some motor neuron of Chalasani TRP-4 ion channels in a way that the maggots are genetically altered.
Implements a modified creatures cross-sound, sound waves powered by micro-bubbles and maggots has been forwarded into and start the motor neurons that have changed here.
This procedure, scientists with the vibrations of light running and then turn off the neurons is a groundbreaking tool that provides familiarity with optogenetik.
But there are some advantages in the face of this technical sonogenetiğin Chalasani says there could be.
The desired point in the brain should be sent along an optical fiber for low-frequency sound, unlike infrared light waves can pass through unobstructed way texture and thus, can be sent into the brain through the skull.
Chalasani "gene therapy and therapeutic virus clinical setting for specific neurological treatments using targeted cross-sound signal of human neurons sensitive to temporarily believe that cannot be made", he said.
Other applications are muscle cells and insulin-producing cells can concentrate on added.

Oil companies officially collapsed
Oil prices began to fall 2014, until the end of last year were postponed until about 400 billion dollars in investment, up to deep sea (deepwater) suspended oil exploration projects.
According to research by the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices, oil and gas exploration/production of 380-billion-dollar project will cause the suspension, while a wide geography from Africa, the Gulf of Mexico, millions of barrels of production was also deferred.
Reason for cost cuts as the biggest summer of 2014 at $ 1.5 per cent per year while 70 115 value lost a 12-year, which falls on the lower level, showing oil prices report "Company budgets have shrunk dramatically," the report said.
400 BILLION DOLLARS PENDING
Crude oil prices, while new surprises every day, finally seeing the lowest level of the past 12 years fell below $ 30.
"Oil drops to $ 15"; "Oil is no longer cheap" debate in energy consulting company today of obstacles ... Wood Mackenzie, published research, falling prices of industry reveals how.
Finally, the report released in July, falling oil prices are 46 large energy investment of 200 billion dollars to laying down the suspension is Wood Mackenzie, in his new research reveals that this figure has reached up to the end of the year 2015 where.
Accordingly, the last six months of 2015 more large projects were postponed until 22, since oil started the collapse in 2014, a total of 68 major project was suspended.
The value of these projects is approximately 400 billion dollars.
1.8 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY
The effect of low oil prices is "ruthless" corporate plans highlighted in the research, the most affected is the deepwater development projects of the projects.
Suspended projects, a total of 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent corresponding to reserve up to 2025, while 1.8 million barrels of oil production per day so deferred.
According to the survey, most of the projects in question is the final investment decision were postponed until 2017 and later, the first production targets in 2020 to the record 2023.
Over the next five years between deferred 68 project scheduled for 170 billion dollars in potential investment is highlighted in the report, where "the majority of the $ 170 billion deepwater projects."
The reason for this is that the front is very high cost of investment.
"70 percent" of deepwater spending in Mexico, especially in Nigeria, Angola and the United States accounted for oil in the Gulf of weighted projects ".
According to the survey, most countries with deferred oil project inventory Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries, deferred liquid (oil) reserves are almost 90 percent.
Most countries with a large amount of the deferred gas reserves in Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia accounted for a total of 85 percent together.
The majority of natural gas waiting to get around in the deep sea, while liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility from scratch as you build complex and require expensive development solutions.
Most of the companies are exposed to danger, deep sea, Canada's oil sands and in the Caspian Region oil giants with successive commitments stated that companies "longer lower" the price of oil is also expressed trying to adapt the script.
THE EYES ARE IN IRAN
Not many four years ago had a table as follows: the United States and Europe, to stop Tehran's nuclear program, Iran had brought the oil embargo, oil price per barrel is about $ 110, and Iran is a sudden jump in the price of oil exports without reason how were going to be discussed.
This is a completely different scenario we see when we get back next week.
Oil prices of more than $ 30 for the first time since 2004 she saw the gold, which was the production in the United States, mainly because the explosion and Iran sanctions applied to.
For this reason, eyes on Iran.
Iran's oil export in case the increase is already quite saturated on the expressed oil market even more oil will be flowing.
It amazes us today of the price level could cause the below.
Some analysts, Iran Saudi Arabia who do not want to lose market share to more oil of pompalayacağını and Iran-Saudi Arabia says it could be a price war between.
Wake up the sanctions, Iran's main objective of India's fast-growing oil market in Asia and is the former partners in Europe.
Iranian officials in statements they did before 500 thousand barrels per day increase in exports in the first place and after a while, just as they said they aimed to release an amount.
According to the map of Reuters, Iran 22 off the coast of a very large crude oil carriers (VLCC), while at least 13 "full of, in whole or in large amounts.
Iran, the world's fourth largest proven oil reserves in the country.
Thanks to exceptions to sanctions on Iran is still, in some countries, including Turkey, about 1 million barrels of crude oil exports.
Iran's daily oil exports if it is before Yaptırımlardan day was as much as 3 million barrels.
Support Securities research expert Aysun Garcia, descends below $ 20, here's the question of the oil you are replying to: "China-based global growth concerns while increasing downward pressure on commodity prices, deepening your loss in oil prices."
The world's largest importer of oil in China, the reduction of economic slowdown concern that oil demand in parallel with oil since the beginning of the year has reached 20 percent of losses.
In addition to the dollar's global appreciation and global problem of excess supply influence oil pricing under $ 30 in the coming days, we could be seen.
32-33 dollars levels as long as we have not seen the persistent rise in oil price downs movement can be limited and downward pressure can be increased.
At this point the critical level of closures on the under $ 30 in order to continue, it can be said that a key role.
In such a case the bottom 23.30-25.60 lasting relaxation are the main sights of the surprise support district it shouldn't count.

Semester semester break how should be evaluated?
How the students should evaluate the semester break? the question we asked to education specialist-student coach Murat Aydin.
Spring break just for students; at the beginning of the television and computer time, entertainments and rest and should not be considered.
Spring break; preparing for the new era of education and history is a very important opportunity to review period.
The so-called free time spring break at the same time, acquire the knowledge, skills and personality development, is an important opportunity to hobby.
Semester evaluation list.
The edits you make, type and try to implement everything you plan.
I'm pretty sure it's going to take and enjoying it bored: a productive semester period.
Now primarily engaged in the preparation of students for YGS-LYS a productive semester period how should talk about this.
Because YGS-LYS exams prepared the questions most of us much from friends in that direction; "This is how we can get the period, plenty of questions we need to solve or we have we have them missing?"
Both give and answer to spend a productive period with us entry to friends advice prepared for the exam.
Exam preparation process under normal circumstances 9. supposed to be a process starting from the class we are trying to complete within the last 1 year more; This is the last year of a more effective, efficient and time for more accurate by using forced us to spend.
Senior exam preparation also have to carry out their work with writing school.
Graduate students who have completed the school although at least 1 exam (YGS-LYS) even if you have entered and have experience, take the test again as to prepare graduates years are critical for him, too.
Because most grad students and family ' o' as the last chance of the year and this is a greater stress.
Study; the student does not receive the pleasure felt compelled to do for himself only, and are therefore often left at the end is always working, but I; make a habit of regular, for students who have become a task that is completely and know what was to be done within a plan all the time.
Now I have spring break in front of us and we should make the most of it.
For this, we have a plan that will allow us to manage the time necessarily.
Whilst On A Half-Year Study:
Everybody's priority is to make your own status as an appropriate plan.
1. What is missing what the period taken care of, left; day, week, and day-time can be scheduled.
During this period there must be both topic occurrences must be both questions solutions.
Also missing is pretty much any non-students average 1-2 trial exam can solve.
Incomplete Selects Take: Research; 75 percent of the learned people in one week, 66 percent in a day of testing, 54 percent of them had forgotten in an hour.
Forget to eliminate the best and are the most effective way to do again.
Especially students too many mistakes of past General review should give weight to the work.
Identify your missing issue first and plan the day, place and subject each day to take care of them.
This planning, you can relax both academically and psychologically.
Threads when placing your plan, you made a mistake most topics.
Because in later times so you will be a long holiday period.
Question Solutions:
Solve as many questions as to te subject repetition is very important.
Because we work how we understand but we've received feedback through our questions, we can see from.
Number of put-away each day, keep in mind that a certain question solution.
Çözeceğiniz number of questions may vary according to the work you will do that day; topic work mainly on a day you have made, you may not be able to solve a lot of questions but still at least how we learned that day we see a certain amount of questions in terms of the solution should work.
Trial Exams:
A half-year break and essays must be other work to solve.
Although the topics are all unfinished, though at least you can make course practice test solutions.
Let's just say that; Turkish courses greatly reduces the degradation; 40 '-question can resolve the Turkish lessons prepared attempts.
And in doing so while study.
40 Turkish question if at first if you can figure out your goal in 60 minutes, if possible, a few minutes later in less resolve.
Plan Vacations And Hobby:
Holidays mean of course just does not mean the study; also a few day you should allocate for your vacation, recreation and hobbies.
Just studying to pass an holiday period will prevent the discharge and relaxation.
So, you will spare yourself in your plans must also have private time.
Read a book, watch television, surf the Internet to what your plans may be, most notably in how much you will take the time.
I didn't spend the first period a little to friends who say efficient advice.
If; My first period very well, so I'm missing much if you haven't studied and says it's half term and greater opportunity for you.
But primarily, I have to believe and to decide.
Turkey football Super League 2009-2010 season goals most 76. and 90. minutes are thrown in between.
Now you come over to a question you asked yourself, and you are you going to the locker room, or the match is still in progress and goals are you?
I think it's been defeated a team coach or player is a classic use of comment "will look to the next game now," no one wants to say.
Now the only thing you have to do is look at the drop in front of you, not to walk past should be run.
What we ask, if we round up:
1) primarily a semester break plan,
2) do you know issues over again,
take care, your Missing issue 3)
4) Question do the subject by solving towards normalising,
solve 5) essays,
6) read the book,
Select new targets for the new era 7),
8 you enjoyed Yourself, hobbies and) things take time,
take time for your family and your friends, 9)
10) take the time to social and cultural activities (cinema, sports, theatre, concerts, excursions, picnics, etc.)

Moderately obese patients with diabetes with weight loss surgery can help
According to a new study in patients with type 2 diabetes moderate obese obesity surgery may take at least five years see the benefit.
However, moderately obese patients with diabetes with obesity surgery after surgery compared to patients who see longer too early to tell if they're alive.
The new study was carried out on the article wrote the JAMA surgery and obesity surgery expert Dr. Robin Blackstone according to "it takes a long time to clear itself of mortality."
Weight loss surgery, bariatric surgery, gastric uses several methods to reduce the diameter of.
All this reduces hunger and the body's ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes but research body mass index (BMI) of most of the 35 or above was done on obese people of high integrity.
Weight length ratio between the BMI measurement over 18.5 to 24.9, is considered normal.
25 or above indicates that a person's BMI overweight BMI over 30 is considered obese, those who are.
The BMI can account from the following link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
The new study, Taiwan's fully fledged Min-Sheng Hospital, since 2007 type 2 diabetes moderate obese patients Bariatric Surgery-two kinds of applied in the treatment of gastric bypass and gastric tube surgeries-to compare the data obtained from the experiment.
Since the end of the fifth year of the investigation, the average BMI of 31 operated from 24.5 to declined.
On the other hand, non-surgical-diabetes being treated remained stable at around 29 of the BMI.
36% of those with diabetes, surgery 16th is the 28th% partially solved.
Medical treatment of the ways only 1% of diabetes compared to this group completely, and only 2% is also partially solved.
In addition, the authors according to blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol, "saw the band" surgery is usually better.
The researchers, at the same time reflecting the rate of blood sugar over time in patients with A1c blood levels of hemoglobin showed.
It says researchers A1c hemoglobin is best kept under 7%.
Postoperative A1c hemoglobin are average 9 percent from 6 percent.
Medical treatment group remained stable around 8 per cent.
But that's more hemoglobin A1c levels remitted "glycemic control", carrying out research, Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and according to teammates that never tipped a rate of mortality in five years.
The research team compared these two findings on hand surgery type.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery compared to the group with stomach tube surgery Group gave more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and likewise A1c hemoglobin (2.1% to 3.1%) was seen higher lows and diabetes more likely entirely of regression (% 46.9 a 16.7).
Research the fifth at the end of the year after surgery, though not a clear benefit to survive Arizona Medical College-Phoenix to Dr. Blackstone, is executed in patients with fatter in Sweden according to a study by the surgery he extend the lifetime of the current data, he said.
Swedish in this study, obese patients who had Bariatric Surgery 15 years are more likely to die within the traditional treatment as compared to a 29 percent lower than other groups.
Although this new study surgical patients do not show what happened to survival benefits, according to relevant Blackstone and BMI for those people who are under 35 this is reassuring.
This is the most crucial part of the article, because BMI says that this surgery is safe, in the group with low risk of death or have not seen any increase in renal ailments, he said.
Blackstone, the people of doctors and the patient's BMI of 27 to 30 below the fall should start taking seriously the issue of weight gain, he added.
I think people expect this matter enough to take it seriously, he said.
I think that that makes their bodies associated with diabetes and obesity genetic changes after you collect these turn it around is really hard.

Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett against North Queensland Cowboys team won Saturday night's semi-final after the Storm not to a non-vague reference to "that game Rugby League described it as a" cautionary tale match and two Oueensland's said "very large" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's struggle, and focused only "contact" while fighting, he said.

This beat-arrival in the us 24-2 Trent Robinson, I don't hear you talking about wrestling, said Bellamy said on Wednesday.
All year round in our defence system or technical in our guarantee that we change anything, just in the past six weeks have made a real emphasis on our contact and fight this was a turning point for us.
Trent's three years there and obviously a great team and mentored a small shock for himself must have not used to losing.

This is when your players in this type of football is that you'll want to play.
put this point in 2010, now everyone wants to play this style football-each team Anthony Milford and I Hunt like half (binaries) so it is not possible to play in this format.

The Broncos must have a good game in the match, I didn't watch it yet, but what was the score? 16-12.
Our match 20-18, the two sides of our game score more but exciting football?
Or hack attacks but attacks the score-generating exciting to do?

Hürrem Sultan's red hair, Beren, Justin hair ...
Also considered to be normal until a work place to resemble celebrities life started to impress in its entirety is seen as a psychological discomfort after the point.
' Celebrity worship syndrome ', aka ' şöhretliye worship syndrome ', which has become a very already the world academic topic, we talked about the new new thing.
The famous photo of the Lady to the salon so far run with normal.
But for all the red hair hovers with Ireland ' adolescents Hurrem Sultan ' not to mention the year.
The aesthetic operations in 2015 we left behind ' Banks had already led by the nose.
Guys, on the side of the case is not that much different.
Dressing up as a period was Al-' adiyat Polat Alemdar.
Now it's the opposite of a raging wind.
Justin Bieber was filled with young man a copy of our environment.
So much so that two years later we read a thousand times on the Internet redundant information: "first of all, when you go to the barber shop, I mean the side of your hair over the ears to the top of your head and NAP."
The sides alone will be brief.
After cutting your hair lightly with water features.
With the help of spray forming operation finishes your hair.
"Justin's hair was damp to shape terms to achieve."
All these are already in the world, we have become new academic spoken ' Celebrity worship syndrome ', aka ' şöhretliye worship syndrome.
We love celebrity fans like.
With the number of fans, how it has impacted them artists been bragging about.
Fortunately, he does not see that simple psychology.
What to eat or drink, particularly adolescents, what to listen to, according to decide what to wear famous.
Excessive devotion to the names presented as unattainable, role models described as mental illness.
Psychologist Sümeyye Demir, Turkey in behind the work in this field.
But families also gradually who cannot miss: "one of the basic science of Psychology issue is at peace with one's own peace of mind in their own identity."
At first, fill with children's room banners, get someone to achieve disguised as a very seriously.
Now this is changing.
Parents feel the need to intervene in the situation.
"Passion for Someone the teenager in your life has gone sign that something's wrong."
Riding the roller coaster of emotional fans
Celebrities, not benign moderation.
Wanting, wanted him to marry her husband jealous, his apparel on prefer pay attention to symptoms such as a slight tingle, suggests Daniel.
We're talking about people on the name of repute.
None of their lives to worry about them as normal as a place to be.
But the expert mostly teenagers who took the bun I spoke too harshly in a psychiatrist opinion: "it runs in the family, or around the point of virtue, good deeds, the kid will represent the absence of the names I'm sure that you're running out of space."
Always good examples.
"Olumsuzlukları is copying children too."
How to get closer to them when we consulted Sümeyye Das, şöhretliye passion is seen more of adolescence begins Recalling words.
Adolescents ' self-confidence may be considering issues for the more comfortable is exceeded.
On the one hand, the other hand while complaining about the limitations of family support and compassion are faced with waiting: "we have to keep in mind the ups and downs of their emotional."
New research has been forced due to the change occurring in the brain.
"The boy riding the roller coaster of Emotional speaks passionately and concentrates on a natural, soft connect delicately."
Possible to change the behaviour of
Psychologist Sümeyye Das, the duty of parents to overcome the şöhretliye worship syndrome reminds me of:
Her emotional distress, make sure you're calm before the issue.
Don't let testimonials drown out never feelings.
To encourage independence for his fans to specify your respect.
Azarlayarak showcase good examples rather than teach, discuss it on names him will be a role model.
Celebrities in everyday life try to get dealt with.
Şöhretlilerin about books to read together in the real world, it's going to work.
Convert to the format of certain adult adult communication.
Uses the same routes in the brain of the dependency and motivation.
Is the opportunity to share with your child, change of bugs as it is.
Get support by experts about Fanlık.
He also carves his envy and admire that
Şöhretliye-worship on the basis of anticipation and other needs to get help from the apsara.
Engellenemeyen love, a distress call, actually.
But unfortunately that is not detected.
Moreover, this problem is so common that it is not possible to confine a country or continent.
Dr. Re Hajnalka Yadav, in each country, television, which is busy points out that certain names.
Connect to more with this famous syndrome: "they are out of the ordinary."
The General does not have the majority of their facilities.
Those who have acted like them they can't live with.
We didn't dare did not adopt either of the or.
"But they're also both non-is way way have to picture continues to storm tracking."
Gul Khan's angry followers who envy or actually no difference.
Both are secretly Admire.
They're effortless money, they only hope agenda.
It's enough to know that to increase the fan.
Another important recommendation of the expert Psychologist Sümeyye Iron at this point to question the reality of these lives.
When it comes to artificial life are overlooked.
Support of the environment, to the person who Şöhretliye passion comes into play here.
But the person is celebrity itself as well as the fan troubles mulls agree that.

Including individual every human childhood needs to be.
So respect the decisions of parents or social surroundings, when asked if the idea itself is valuable in matters concerning you and hissettirilsin.

For example, instead of the child in matters concerning the child to decide (what to wear, what to eat), the child's own right instead of shrug requests diretilmesi (sending the kid who wants to go the football course instrument course) to respect the child's behaviors such as personality.
