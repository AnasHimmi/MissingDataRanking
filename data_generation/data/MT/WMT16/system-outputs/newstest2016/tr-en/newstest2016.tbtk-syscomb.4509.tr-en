With a quarter of some conditions support a 15 per cent, while the other part will support it only if there is a candidate.
Clinton does not support a stretch of six per cent.

What will happen when the Fed increased interest rates?
Climbing the tepetaklak bull market and bonds with the rise of interest rates, the economy would also decline.
We know it.
The whole thing is that we do not know what they are, and how it will continue to take place on time.
History, especially in the economy, it would have very little information about the timing.
Decline, the first decline in 11 months after the interest rate increase as soon as it took place, 86, has been so long that month.
The Central Bank of the United States, the Fed increased interest rates to the aggressive, if not constant, usually economic and financial assets in the response has been decisive.
The US central bank officials to raise interest rates when the investors began to focus on how long the process of normalizasyon will not need therefore to stress with violence.
The various variables. It is a fact that is
Finally, however, market participants may think that overemphasising, amidst the interest rate increase.
Global Başekonomisti Capital Economics, Julian Jessop-" since the global financial crisis, in a note to clients, some of the first Fed rate increase by the end of the era of cheap money '' came to be interpreted as pointing out that "is inevitable, he said.
On the contrary, the United States interest rates are still low, slowly, but we do not expect to return to more normal levels are seen as the seismic fear that most of the coup.
Nevertheless, there will be no impact. We cannot.
Based on past trends, will be the reaction of some of the areas of the economy:
Interest rates are also seen in the past months, as the market for a period of time to expect some things to improve may be unstable.
Interest rates would not be so dramatic. at the moment that
What will happen after the Fed increases "equity in a new study that Deutsche Bank analysts, the fruits of 12 and 24 months after the first rate increase in the trend, which appears to be stalling" may be reflected in the monetary policy of stalling.
Analyst Bob Doll of Nuveen asset management, which is more often in the past 35 years, according to a recent analysis of market share to around 14 per cent and-@-@ 250 days after interest in the right flat to increase is moving forward in a line (an average of 2.6 per cent increase) and 500 and return to normal later in the day, while the average yield 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles.
Deutsche, shares the impact on the to increase more dramatically in the next phase of the cycle of interest rate and said the yield is due to be destroyed.
Economic setback, it is a fact of life, but also the interest increases would help them.
The Fed would accelerate the decline in the current situation, which does not exist before, and some cases are facing.
The most attention, gross domestic product for the Fed interest rate increase so far in the lowest level.
Since 1950, according to Deutsche Bank, which took place in the building, the nominal interest rate 118 years fell below 4.5 per cent to the gross domestic product only twice a year.
Took place at every level of 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of the year 2015, according to the Fed, this situation is the permanent, although expected by the third quarter and stands at 1.5 per cent.
To raise interest rates in such a delicate economic climate, according to Deutsche could be risky and may lead to "" question whether it will be different this time.
The attention of the market participants expect the Fed interest rate increase this week for a year, in a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC may approve an increase in this meeting, although the term only 25 per cent, pointing to the possibility.
"since 1950, we have done research in the report, which took place today, until the whole cycle of building super cycle of a rising trend of recovery, which began in the gross domestic product, and then decline," rapidly reach the summit, he said.
On the contrary, this, for example, which took place at a time when the worst decline has not been seen in a slow recovery.
The current cycle, the Fed was expected since the longest cycle without declined over the past months and 35 -- the longest in the admissions cycle, however, whether the 74th month cycle that we are still continues.
He was unstable, with expected interest rate increase in the fixed income market and order a bit similar to that of the equity.
The difference in the impact on bonds, had changed the course of Fed policy being faster than it was at stake.
The first / decline when bond yields rise cycle does not change that immediately.
At the end of the cycle of interest rate increase and bond yields are now lower, "Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab, the rise in interest rates, according to experts, more and more short term strategy as bond yields closer between the curves will be straightened.
Analysis in the high yield bonds us from Schwab analysts, who said he usually better performance in such an environment, but we are still careful about reaching yields "" be Jones.
Interestingly, Jones thinks it is already adapted to market expectations of Fed policy.
"The power of the dollar and the decline in inflationary expectations, according to the market, in addition to tighter monetary policy, there are various signal" wrote.
Short term interest rates rise, the productivity curve, proper credit expanded, and the spread has increased to fly -- the Fed to tighten policy that will be seen in the market in all characteristics.
Broad terms, the most of their business in the United States, the companies increased interest rates and local products will be they will make more attractive.
That owed several multinational companies, the situation will be worse, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive on global markets and debt will be even more expensive.
Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for their clients at the beginning of history, such a rise of stock 'quality' "" shows will be able to live a poor performance.
1994,1999 companies that have strong balance sheets and the 2004 rate increases thereafter weak balance sheets, with an average of 5 per cent.
High waves and low yield a capital stock of the companies that have low quality opponents (4 per cent) and go), with an average of 3 per cent.
Debt, it will become a major issue.
High rate, according to Goldman, floating debt, the companies have to suffer the most.
Gross stock market, except for the game, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Every how experts have differing views on how fast will the tasarrufçu can also benefit from the higher gains.

Transfer to a dire situation -- at the age of 18, Manchester, a young man, may have a difficult time, in the wake a spectacular, and after all of this.
While in the locker room because there was wearing oxygen masks.
Crying.
To at least six months, so if you have broken from the couple, but I am not a doctor, and that would mean he could not play in the group stage.
I hope to play again this season.
Moreno and luck in penalty shots to narrowly escaped from a red card.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli Meksikalıyı was not punished.
Italian officials have suggested that the mistake Van Gaal.
When I say that this is a penalty and red card yourself, you can try.
A very bad fight with two legs.
In the account of Shaw "tweet." I want to thank you all for your messages, not enough words to describe how disappointed I live, my road to recovery is starting now, I will return stronger. "
PSV on: Manchester United, which took place in the Shaw injury is the shock of
The Champions League, which will be held in France next July, it will be in order to improve the morale of British defender.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu, said to be a very bad injury. "".
Such an injury to Hadise everyone will regret it if it came to the beginning of any player.
Not AS rival, with the intention of our players to injury.
Moreno, the 2014 World Cup in the Netherlands, Van Gaal, who lived to be broken leg while playing in the team against Mexico.
Cocu, this situation is very difficult to find because the intention of never rival was not to injury, and this is a very bad was broken after hearing has not been good at all, he said.
It was not possible to see them in my memory for me.
The only thing I can see the ball go in a different direction. It was touching, but I have not been able to see Luke's çalım Haudbourg Moreno.
"SBS 6 told Moreno: a feeling that I know how I know how difficult it can be such a thing.
I feel very bad, and I am very sorry for that.
From PSV Andrés Guardado was taken to hospital as a result of her battle with Chris Smalling.
Of course, David Cameron The Lorax knows better than this?
This is something that every parent has learned in the short time: Your children are learning to love a book, then almost ezber's will not take more time, you know.
If you are not seems if David Cameron.
For child care as a holiday scheduling by the supplier favourite books for children when asked what the prime minister the Lorax, Dr. Seuss's 1971 exit-environmental Tale.
Company said in a message posted on its web site SuperCamps "summer" Cameron said that this is a difficult decision, which is Funny, creative and impressive strong message, a message that we all jump in this book, the content of experimentation or incorporates ", my children, I love to read.
Up to this point, everything is going well, it turns out that Cameron's supposedly wrote something about the content of the book, but in fact, the original story, the content of the text to inflate in of the new character and details of the book until 2012 Boroume film version of the paragraph was added.
With all the walls that nature is there, even the air is a city örü Thneed-Ville Ted in the name of child in their dream girl, Audrey, in order to win the hearts of his desire to see a real tree, he writes, it wants to carry out the real name of Theodor Seuss Geisel and Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, which was not included in the story of a love story.
If the suspects were not enough, if you do this, Cameron has dealt with a text that online Archive of the Lora Film short films, which are very similar, with the text of the summary "started. Everything is a commodity, and even the air artificial walls with a child in the name of the city, Ted Thneed-Ville örü" daughter Audrey wishes to win the heart of his dream.
The country's is a parent claims to Cameron's, anonymous young a child to the local environment in the name of the book, yaratık "" bodur-mustache, and speaking on behalf of the trees, greedy who cut trees ağış-ören Once-ler despite the objections, that the main subject of the book to be unaware of a possible.
It is likely that such a weak, a public relations job, but they also have been referred to the Emir kulun The Lorax is someone who has not been read to a child for the 20th consecutive time.
The text, a spokesman for the presidency, Hanim's Cameron's election came from his office that he thought, he said.
Confirmation that assure SuperCamps Cameron from the staff of the text. But it has not commented on the outside.
Man in Britain, but is still under risk of issuing a clear Lyth sapasağlam
But it is a difficult task to play with Pakistan tour in the United Arab Emirlik selected for the British team after seeing the last time 3-0 test series defeat a repeat, I think, not in the cards.
Nevertheless, I do not rule out the possibility of a win away.
Alastair Cook could be more inexperienced's team three years ago, according to the collective understanding of the game, but there are good players who returned the kick line, and just a little too strong; they would not improve the wounds of 2012, would provide youth source of optimism.
Collection, Moeen Ali Rashid is developing as a return and fair play in the game, even if it is not known the level of quality of the test represents an option for an attack.
Britain was out of the test team and was replaced by Alex Hales Lyth: Man on the
Man as the top coach in Yorkshire, the decision to adopt Lyth analysis to be a difficult decision for me.
Seven tries against two good offensive in difficult circumstances and simple but unavoidable fact is that cricket can be prosecuted according to the results.
There was no question regarding Joe Root, for instance, has been left to be done because -- as I said before the announcement of the players are the best choice for him.
But few could see an extended number Lyth career after a series of fifty self determination.
If the work more, and I hope it will be another opportunity for Yorkshire.
British head coach Trevor Bayliss, the best performance of the show, but the attitude the players and that Praises has not surprised me; above all, he is a man of the team.
The ratings hit a trial is difficult to answer the question of how long that will take.
On the other hand, Nick Compton received seven kep Lyth-like Sam Robson before it got nine.
Only-replay Compton, the chance of the match.
You can feel the pain may be the first to go before Britain's Karayiplere-Lyth's form for Jonathan Trott, who was at its peak -- but this waste the opportunity now in the past.
And hit me in a high level, according to Alex came Hales.
X -- a factor in the quality of cricket, and it is, at the beginning of this season the Trent Bridge, Yorkshire 236 number against us that we have seen in the field.
At least the same opportunity before it may need to be taken for this subject, but that depends on the makeup of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
Moeen, while four quick extra votes to achieve a return of the opening kick at the same time, Cook, in a way that will ensure that the idea to work, and I am not against it.
I do not understand why he could not do a 66.0m here a shot, and left them already shows how good cricket as a conservative.
Moeen city for Worcestershire but they could not do its job, and there is no much difference also see a No. 3.
My former teammate Justin Langer, the first of 38 test in 2001, prior to the start of the first to play in the fall.
Three hundred of the series to win immediately, and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari team to return to the game reserve as and has been impressive in limited my discussions with him as a young man surprised me.
People are crude statistics-kick and the ball an average of 31 in 35 on average -- and they can see is a degaj may think they can, however, too much to the game, and there is no return to young players, the vote in favour.
Will learn a lot in this round.
Away from the team, England coaching team of its own to a few kurnaz eklenti appears to have done.
The SRI Lankan hit Mahela Jayawardene's Test matches as a consultant for the deployment of the professional may be a measure.
He is one of the loveliest man; in any case, and the entire offensive game that will bring a lot of experience.
Paul Collingwood round for the white ball feet. and both the energy and play a series of brutal rule.
It always was born, regardless of whether a player or coach for the cricket world international and Mahela is such an understanding can be a guide. I thought it
Sometimes in the locker room before the new voices, the message said, even if his team could bring an innovation.
A day from Durham around the Colly teammate Ben Stokes Root has been tapped for the Games, was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it.
Not everyone agrees, though, coaches and players is not done by those who choose the plan.
And you should not forget that players such as the work of them depends on the results.
Any such decisions would not be won easily.
If the economy is stagnant until 2017 Brexit camp could win in
David Cameron, the British half baked again in order to keep the EU are getting worse every day, and this is a negotiating strategy to the Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn "" yes or no? or, to be elected on Europe on Tuesday, despite the fact that infuriated the TUC.
There are also Corbyn and Nigel Farages are among The foreigners.
A European diplomat recently I acquaintances, some of the member states, that it is not entirely due to their own crisis ridden in the EU, and most do not want any kind of concession, the British only their own separatist who think they are fed up with the changes to the pact, and disrupt their work agenda, he said.
At the annual meeting of the TUC in Brighton, social protection to harm if they did not want to reach a decision.
We can even Buna Dave and George has his own agenda.
The prime minister and the chancellor, peaks in the capitals of foreign countries, or whether there are there in front of the famous monuments in bilateral meetings with or without their own official who came to the future, and then return to the country and reform for the allies said they had collected.
This is purely to do with me.
Berlin "do not leave us with France" a tent within the EU, while the extrovert British European short wing increasingly more ministers and officials in the capital, some of my friends who had come to a point where they no longer cared that we should remain, he said.
Cautious and smart at the beginning of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in power for 10 years at the same time an ally, it has been in and Thatcher (11 years), Kohl and Mitterrand (14), (16), for instance, want to be separated from power, such as in the situation to deteriorate.
Francois Hollande, to be elected in 2017 in France or face to face with the change of power.
A force that is left.
Soon from the right, the nationalist government in Poland, Spain and left in a government came to power.
Energy should be used to block secession from the United Kingdom of Scotland Selfie Britanyalılar, it is not possible for the good of this country because they do not want because most separatist tendencies.
Such that some of the ministers, Scotland National Party-style in 2017, the United Kingdom during the referendum campaign is this situation will not be benefits to deliberate in as they may be planning to speed up the process of Brexit; my friend.
Britain was not negotiating a restructuring "and" "" will benefit from the talks did not achieve anything.
Europeans, from the previous experience of Fleet Street's how exploitation, oligarchic press baron's how EU opposition is because they know they are not like this time Tony Benn, a rate of 1 to 2 in 1973 with approved our entrance to the 1975 referendum is a source of inspiration.
At the beginning of the 1990s, Brussels correspondent "flat Muz opened" also known by the name of the EU, which is particularly remember Boris Johnson said such-153.3m opportunistic.
All ahmak aside, Ed Miliband, who know that the enemies.
Among them are the tax-, illegal phone tapping, the foreigners, and there are alleged to have a lot of our newspapers, large foreign residence.
In Tony Blair about this are often think the same things, at the same time a cage with a azgın goril inside of the left him to lunch, tea and pursuing prey in the hours to avoid attention by giving Muz opened to understand.
The bright, in fact, Miliband, Cameron opposed the idea of a referendum to Blaircı_Past from Blair, because Blair, who gave him a card users in 2005 by French and Dutch votes by making concessions on the principle of the EU constitution, which was cancelled.
The media also never pardoned him on this issue.
Now that sıvazla-friendly back at Westminster, But on Monday, the seat of my own to me when I say there is no time to lose -- Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock, now 80, who was just a mistake then, Murdoch appears to be in danger of a strategy to take back the boycott.
With the media, although it will take time, not with me, to be in communication with Andrew Marr, the BBC on Sunday, leaving the post of the need to develop a coherent strategy.
Corbyn's official position in Europe, developing kibarca as I said.
A reform of the past, we want to stay within the EU.
Most of the people who left Ukip's hostile tendencies and fervent supporters of the conservative small İngilterecilik's said yes to it.
Already, "a Benn, but this was no Bennite" Hilary Benn also said this week in radio and television, because the appointment of John McDonnell as shadow chancellor in a naive way Corbyn and forced him to acknowledge that it is not a bad idea.
Me on television, his father was in the 70 workers in the cabinet, it does not go far in the fight over the lack of loyalty to his friends and a reminder of a lost serve in the cabinet.
Hilary's struggle more attractive.
But in any case with the testimony of "Benn-"" to fight to stay, nor the McDonnell said JC's lordlara told lawmakers in a special meeting held on Monday night, the same thing.
Touching me, if we bear in mind that Corbyn's yılışık-general description, trying to convey the image of bed and bilhassa paranoia and betrayal, 7 / 24 TV, regardless of what age continues to protect girdap social media is the message of the importance of discipline.
To Cameron, such as the McDonnell said to guarantee the support of Labour Party in a referendum on Europe, which makes it difficult to ensure that it is reasonable.
Simon Jenkins, certainly think so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's EU membership's Bennite siege economy and anti-capitalist past compatible with their transition to now only small differences narsisizm's öğreti-hırgür the basic ingredients are from the left wing of the opponents in a protracted civil debate.
NATO, as in the shift to the right -- Tom Watson, JC-determined he would not campaign for foreign diplomats to leave the country for their effendi from them to an old masters will have to deal with.
Paris or Berlin while there are also sceptical voters for their own reasons, all of them have lost political capital on the concessions to Britain could be in vain?
On Monday, the British influence security Forum opened to me, as it has been said already the United States, the ruling conservative party, reducing the cost to the government of Iraq, but the British in Libya and Syria, due to the weak minimum performance is very disappointed to hear.
Experts are critical of the British public health e-smoking research
The researchers, financed by the government, an agency that, in a meeting with links to the tobacco industry, which is that there are 12 people allegedly e-95% less harmful than smoking cigarettes, they said.
In the British medical Dergi (BMJ), the public health experts writing on cigarettes (PHE) e-joined in criticising the Lancet that evidence used in the report.
Described in a detailed examination of the evidence, "PHE" "" nature of the turning point in the report published last month.
But some researchers questioned the soundness of the data, and some experts note the connections between the tobacco industry.
Dating back to The main outcome of last month in the Lancet medical journal editorial PHE "" exceptionally rotten at the core of the target.
In the sand, or the allegations, and two other researchers who wrote in BMJ "" questioned whether it is being built on the rocks.
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in Europe, the author Martin McKee, professor of public health and clinical professor of epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, Simon Capewell şunnu "the basic principle of public health policy is based on the evidence of the event."
Public's PHE's ", according to the best available estimate e-cigarette smoking around 95% less harmful" allegations that the evidence and modellemenin would be based on a detailed examination of the expectations said.
In fact, this change their views about the losses related to products containing nikotin's analysis of a resolution to create a synthesis of many criteria (MCDA) model in order to develop a 12-member collected from a meeting; the the results of the meeting, it has been summed up in a research article.
McKee and Capewell, sponsors of the meeting, one of the previous general manager, an independent research for receiving funds from British American Tobacco reported that in the name of the EuroSwiss Health, a company, he said.
It is also a report of a sustainable, BAT said it also approved the promotion of public health certificate.
The meeting is one of 12 people in an e-cigarette maker Philip Morris International cigarette company funds, but that it was previously reported that they reportedly received from the Fund, adding that it is not.
How the panel members to be elected in the article was not given, but they include some of the information industry, including some giants e-'s known smoking fund reported.
Some other people who were present at the meeting is not known for their expertise on the issue of tobacco control.
Tobacco chief PHE people also attended the meeting.
The group, McKee and Capewell wrote a research article's "effectively" "several concrete evidence about the losses of many products, according to the criteria, it is acknowledged that the lack of summer.
However, none of these connections or restrictions't PHE was discussed in the report.
McKee and the children, or for people who do not smoke cigarettes, "Capewell e-" does not have any evidence to be a transition to smoking, said the allegations that it is too early.
Health and prosperity in PHE direktörüi Professor Kevin Fenton, BMJ allegations were previously to answer, he said.
"E-" significantly less harmful than smoking cigarettes.
Lifetime smokers who die due to this addiction is one of two people.
E-compared the health risks of smoking all the evidence, he pointed to a small, but we must continue to examine-@-@ term effects of the long.
PHE's clear: a public, bilhassa mukayese with tobacco that losses in much of the confusion, at a time when the evidence and not on things to inform.
Almost 80,000 people a year die from a disease linked to smoking, and smoking cost the NHS to £2 billion per year.
The current evidence-e-cigarette smoking, but not without risk, carrying only a small part of the cause of the damage - we are fulfilling our national responsibility to formulate a clear.
The previous Channel 4 chief BBC's EastEnders should quit, he said,
The head of Channel 4 programs, such as the BBC and The Voice EastEnders Luke Johnson before publication, he said, must leave his rivals and advertising programmes such as Albert Square series of hits for "" said they could give their right arm.
Johnson, the only other licensee of British publishers are not the kind to make programmes should be used, he said.
The BBC programme against their rivals, who received the highest ratings in December, a valuable public service, which is more likely to be followed by a small group of viewers that stations such as BBC4, criticised the programmes.
Tony Hall, the director general of the BBC, said that the organisation wanted to collaborate more with the other institutions; Johnson, the BBC and Channel 4, in order to create a bond after he failed in his own time in the six years to be tested in a way, he said.
Johnson, a committee of the House chamber during the interrogation of communication on the future of the BBC "openly without subsidy programmes that can be shown by rivals." I am struggling with the idea and ordered the release of
In the medium or long term that I am not sure that there is a good idea of the exit, if you continue to implement the licensee, or at least that others do not order programmes should be reduced.
Published in The Voice primetime December because they want to provide gaining broad support as possible for the future.
No one else thought would not publish the basic idea here is that this is ridiculous and is clearly nonsense.
The reason Johnson "" programs could help fund without tax Paisy Hilendarski fund, I do not understand the need for a rate cut.
And The Voice EastEnders another one is actually being done within the company.
To be honest, if necessary, would give their right arm for this and other channels.
I try to see how it is for the public service broadcaster.
I do not think this will hardly heralded the BBC.
Channel 4 from 2004, which runs until 2010, a series of entrepreneurs, Johnson, "people who work here, and that this's ihtira employees's approach long term in order to give support as the best way to go," BBC in the ratings.
The BBC, the most popular programmes about the comments, such as the BBC EastEnders MacTaggart classes in Edinburgh in 2003 in order to offer to sell programmes using previous Sky administrators echoed the comments of Tony Ball.
Johnson went to the BBC programmes's BBC4, more appropriate public service and its audience measurement will not be able to do here, but the 4 billion pounds in income tax amnesty, and that fee of to provide the basis for the religious duties of window us to continue, he said, adding that they can discuss "" subject which we do all these programmes silik't followed by anyone.
Nobody would never watch them loopholes.
About its licensee, Johnson said the committee. ", you make the best benefit for people who are more regresif to find a system I invite.
In the last year, do you think all of you, we all think that subject is a great value, but a lot of 150 pounds, 150 pounds because of the money to do this for the people that I wonder whether the BBC not to watch too much.
At the same time, the committee on Tuesday, presenting evidence of the previous Sky and Channel 5 idarecisi David Elstein, BBC's "to inform, educate and entertain" Reithian mission for the need to revise it.
The BBC exit training is now officially classified as a bit of the -- this is 0.1% 1% of the appearance of the TV and radio broadcasts and public service in Australia and Canada -- have said that the front foot, and that this should be as "information, lighting and educate" needs to be changed, he said.
Partnerships, Elstein, on the BBC TV, however, a handful of Prom, who had to do something about and all of the online advertising monitoring to ensure that broadcasters must go, he said.
'Sonogenetik' brain cells can be controlled by the sound waves to
As soon as they shot video thread Wolves's titreşim voice and seen how they changed direction.
Scientists sound wave of explosions that can be controlled with genetically modified as their nervous system have grown kurtçuk.
Baby thread Wolves titreşim tiz event will not be able to hear the voice of the people and change direction as soon as they are shot.
Ends titreşim are responding to the sound of the waves on the other channels will carry genetic modified as they work to activate the motor nerve cells.
With: Researchers on brain activity of the light and read are
Researchers prove the power of a new procedure called kurtçuk 'Sonogenetik said they were; thus, a series of ultrasound brain, heart and muscle cells can be used to help aktive from outside the body.
From the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California researchers Sreekanth Chalasani Guardian this procedure is a day to treat the symptoms of the disease, Parkinson's titreşim electricity inside the minds of people for a deep-brain stimülasyonunun müdahaleci procedure that could take its place, he said.
Cross Chalasani, however, did not respond to the voice of thread worms often poorly with a liquid containing bubbles have found that they react when they are around.
Found voice bubbles across the waves, and thus strengthen the kurtçuk to pass.
Strengthened voice across the waves, some kurtçuk cells in the barely and impact on structures called TRP-4 Ionian channels.

The brain within the desired point during a optic fibres, which needs to be sent, unlike the light, low cross-frequency sound waves can pass inside tissue in an unimpeded manner and thus could be sent to the brain via the inside of his skull.
Chalasani "Gene therapy using a virus and treat human nöron projected for neurology-certain treatments in clinical environment, beyond the temporary sound signals, we believe that we will be able to make sensible", he said.
Of the other practices kas cells and insülin-producing on the cells could intensify, he added.

We see is a totally different scenario when we return to this week.
Under $30, for the first time since 2004, the price of oil production in the United States, the main cause of the explosion, and saw an embargo against Iran are lifted.
For this reason, the eyes are on Iran.
Iran's oil exports to increase in the situation, it is already quite doygun said the oil market even more oil will be found.
This is the prices are today, which could have led to reduced levels of gold to surprise us.
Some analysts, Iran, who did not want to capture market share in the Saudi Arabia will pump even more oil-S. Arabia and Iran, which says it may be a price war.
Would not wake up sanctions, Iran is the main objective of the former partners in the rapidly growing oil market in Asia, India and Europe.
Iranian officials announced earlier in the day in the first phase, exports to increase 500,000 barrels per day, and a long after a market that has said it aims to increase the amount of so much more.
According to Reuters, Iran's map information on 22 counts of very large crude oil carriers (VLCC), and they are at least 13 "ü completely or in large quantities.

Parallel with the economic slowdown in China, which is the largest oil importer in the world, with concerns about oil demand for oil will decrease since the beginning of the Year, we see that reach the 20 per cent of the missing.
In addition to the global $appreciation and the problem of the global supply of the oil in the coming days under $30 to prices, we could be facing.
$32 and 33 on the level of the rise in oil prices as long as we have not seen a permanent move could rise may be limited, and the downward pressure.
Critical at this point, the level of $30 below their closing in view of the decline can continue to have a key role.
In such a case, which lasted until the bottom side 23.30-25.60 support in the region should not be seen as a surprise.

Should be How semester semester holidays?
Semester, the students holidays should assess? Question education expert-student coach Murat Aydin, we asked for.
Semester holiday; just to relax, have fun, television and computers for students to spend time at the beginning and should not be considered.
Semester holiday; to prepare for the new era of education and it is a very important opportunity to review the past period.
Free time he has been named at the same time, semester holiday, is also an important opportunity to the knowledge, skills and hobi personality development.
Assessment that the list of the semester.
Tried everything in the summer, and implement your plan, you will do.
Olunki confident that you will spend a semester period of joy and quite efficient.
Preparation for fellow students who do YGS-LYS efficient as a priority now, let us talk about how it should be a period of a semester.
Prepares YGS-LYS exams because of questions from friends who come to us most is in the right direction; in this period we should do to resolve if there is no question, we must assess the ample "" missing, we have issues, we should address them?
First test for passing a fruitful period, both to respond to them and let our column with recommendations to friends who were preparing to enter.
Under normal circumstances, the process of preparations for the test starting 9th grade, a process which began to be us while we more in the past year, we are trying to complete; this is the last year for us, the more effective, efficient and is compel us to pass time by using more accurate.
Seniors in preparation for the test at the same time, the school also written work together.
School graduate students completed by at least 1 time test (YGS-LYS) and, even if it is to experience, as a graduate student will be put to the test again though it is of critical importance for the year.
Of the year Because most graduate students and his family's o 'sees as the last chance, and that it would make up a greater stress.
Working class; students get taste, not only for him, he felt compelled to do, and that is why it is usually always left to the most recent study, but it is; regular, become a habit for students who complete a task that has become what it is and will be held at the time, and the always within a plan.
Vacation Next semester, and now we have to evaluate this in the best way.
This is a time we should be a plan that would allow us to good governance.
In the half year to study:
Everyone should do a plan in line with its own situation as a priority.
What has been tackled short period I; planning for 15 days a week, and on time.
In this period, both should be back on the issue and it must be a solution.
At the same time, not too many of the students lack average 1-essayists 2nd) test can solve.
Missing: get your research subjects; they learn about 75 per cent of the people in a week, 66 per cent in a 54 per cent of the day, it also shows that the inside in an hour.
The best and most effective way to eliminate it, will be held again.
Too many students who make mistakes in general from past issues, in particular, it should give weight to work again.
Missing your priority issues identified with you, and you plan on a day, every day, you put on, and you will get them.
This is planning, you can relax as both academic and psychological.
Issues in your plan, while most of the planınıza yerleştirirken a mistake, you pay attention to the issues.
Because at the time, so you will not be a lasting holiday period.
The solution to the question:
To do so, it is very important to solve the problem must issue again.
Because we have done that we solve the problem, however, that we understand how to work through, and we can see from our dönüt.
Do not forget to put a certain number of questions solution Every day.
According to The number of questions, then you will do your work may change; it will solve the issue weighted too much in one day, you have to work together, but you may not be able to resolve the problem, at least on the day to see how much we learned, we should do to seek a solution of the problem in terms of specific rate.
Solve the essay exams:
Another study, you will do in the half year essayists test should be to resolve.
By the end of the entire issues, although not at the very least teach lesson test test solutions, you can do.
He said that since we drafted; you have largely address Turkish classes; 40'ar questions Turkish textbooks, you can try to solve.
And this time while working the inevitable.
40 Turkish question if 60 minutes later, if you can settle in your goal is to be resolved in a few minutes less time if possible.
Holiday and hobi plan:
But it is not just to working class subject to vacation; your vacation, relax and hobi "you should set aside for a few days.
Passed only with the working class will block your deşarj is to be heard, and that it will be a holiday period.
Therefore, to separate yourself within your plan should also be a special time.
The book to read, watch TV, internet surfing occurs during weekends, Ta may be on the inside of your plans to do what you will, how much time to the most important.
For the first time I could not pass efficiency would also be a small, my advice to friends who said.
If I was not able to work; I have not gone very, very good for the first time, and more if you do this semester, the holiday is also a great opportunity for you my shortcomings.
But this, you have to decide, and you have to believe, as a priority.
The Turkish football super league season in 2009 and 2010 were among the most goals in the 76th and 90th minutes.
You answer the question that you asked him to finish the game, and Now you are going to the locker room, or if there are still lingering and many minutes you'll scored and the game?
I think that has been used by the players or coaches of a football team defeated "" we will now look to the next game, which is a classic comment. no one wants to
The only thing you will do now should be to run if you look ahead, rather than dwelling on the past.
If we are going to pick up what we said:
1) a semester recess as a priority plan structure,
2) again over the issues through the structure, you know,
Address your issues, 3) is missing,
4) resolved questions about structure, the
5), the essay exams solve
You read the book, 6)
7), and you set new goals for the new era
8) yourself, and the things that you enjoy your time hobi, you
9), you set aside time to your family and friends,
When you left the cinema (to 10) social and cultural activities, sports, theater, concerts, picnic trips, etc.)

Located in a wing of the central bank doubled the a meeting room of the United States, the wall will be official.
The map of the Fed and his colleagues were Janet L. yelle, head of the women to keep the economic interests of the nation above everything else, in a reminder.

And this is the third of indefinitely.She, which will be announced on Thursday, the US economy since the end of 2008, from short term interest rates close to zero is ready to start cutting off support of the unique stimulus estimates will not be so close to a decision on whether he may be the X factor.
Most of the data showed that the economy is growing at a solid, though if recent turbulence in global financial markets, the Fed officers reference to the federal fund rates - even in less than a quarter of a cent can make ürkek to add-increased vulnerability.
"Simply put, the labor market and inflation will be the first and the most important thing is that" simsar firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co Lindsey M. Piegza, the chief economist said.
"But I think that if they are looking for an excuse in order not to raise rates is the growing uncertainty surrounding the global market" will provide enough grounds for them to wait a little longer.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, and that in itself caused fluctuations in the financial markets.
Half of the economists interviewed by Bloomberg soon expect an increase in interest rates this week.
At the same time, the financial markets, the Fed only about an increase of 30% of the main indicators show with is expected to stay in to wait.

The Fed to raise rates at the moment, it would be surprising "" said.
If Fed jeapordised decisions in this direction, "'ll't panicked financial markets to calm the issue will have to take a long year."
Other experts, when the Fed will act on which the curtain over the removal of a rate increase, suggesting it could calm the financial markets.
Only a month ago, the Fed this month, the rate by 0.25% points on the way to increase it seems; that is, conditions on the road to recession, the United States, this would be a small step to strengthen the recovery.
On the necessity of a process, the more liberal economic yelle complaints despite the rate increase this year, said he expected in the spring and early summer.
Reducing the rate of job creation in August, despite a steady growth in the labor market this year.
The unemployment rate last month, the lowest level since the seven years, fell to 5.1%, which is closer to the level of full employment and the Fed.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And the 2% target annual inflation, the central bank, the Fed, despite the politicians continue to sail under the temporary impact of a sharp drop in oil prices is a major reason, he said.

The Fed is not one of the priority concern is the health of the global economy, so technically they should not be a factor in the process to take profits.
In reality, however, Fed monetary officials of the world.
Great influence in recent years, the central bank.
Until then, the only clues came from Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed in 2013, head of the worldwide market tremors triggered "could reduce" monetary expansion.

The latest turbulence does not come close to this level, he said.
Disgruntled markets for a rate increase that you could not really wants to be in a position to be afraid to go to the head of the International Institute of Economics, Peterson Posen said.

Why I am the evidence of a death in the Oklahoma
Because of a legal action in late today, I will follow the killing of a man.
I hope that it would not be, but if, in the province of Oklahoma Hapishane's death room in the gallery to watch Richard Glossip executed with lethal enjeksiyon while I will sit.

And with this perspective, I will follow his death.
I cannot claim that really would be objective.
You can look at other correspondents in there for this.
