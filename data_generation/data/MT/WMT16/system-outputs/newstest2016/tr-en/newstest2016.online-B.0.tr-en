Donald Trump is showing up in serious numbers of 8 Poll
Some people tried to label him as iridescent.
Others argument as her big joke.
And it gives some support to internal explosion.
Some Republicans tried to pull down at Donald Trump in this survey (yet) did not work.
The most recent national survey 11 showed him the leadership of Donald Trump in double-digits and start asking some real estate emperor of the chance of being nominated.
Of course, too early in the election cycle.
None of this does not mean that you can win the race, Republican candidates Trump.
Experts in 2011 for Herman Cain, Rick Perry of the rise in this period, they express what is causing the rise, both failed to win even a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons to have trouble in the general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's conservative super PAC group and economic growth, which groups are becoming aware of the persistent strength of the Club Trump and they start spending their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey results showing that the property only temporarily come to the emperor:
preference ratio Trump changed 180 degrees.
Donald Trump candidacy in mid-June just before the declaration of a survey done at Monmouth University, two of the 10 Republicans for the real estate emperor had shown that it has a favorable opinion.
Than 40 percent in the middle of July.
At the beginning of August was 52 percent.
Donald Trump now has a favorable opinion from six to 10 Republicans.
Roughly three through 10 will mean that negative opinion.
And these numbers are watching high in the early stages.
Iowa last week, a poll showed that they preferred Quinnipiac'ta that Donald Trump is 60 percent of Republicans there.
GOP voters in three of them can be satisfied with the Trump candidacy.
A CNN conducted last week / if ORC survey, 67 percent of Republican candidate Trump "enthusiastic" or "satisfied they said was" the will.
If only two of the 10 people nominated if he will "upset" they said.
I just creates the same level of enthusiasm Carson Trump (43 percent "enthusiastic" would be 40 percent for the Trump told).
Enthusiasm nearest other people?
Only 21 percent compared to Marco Rubio.
On the other hand 47 percent of Republican voters, regardless of the institution's favorite candidate Jeb Bush "will be satisfied" or "they would be upset," he said.
The majority of the Republican Trump's temperament does not see a problem.
Donald Trump, due to the bombast and humiliation Monday criticized ABC News / Washington Post survey based on questions asked to become president of real estate and 52 percent of Republicans think that the emperor has the right temperament.
In Iowa, the first party congress will be held the same figure applies to the country, where 52 percent of Republicans compared to last week's Quinnipac think that people have to be its leader.
I still think that he has a personality that will serve as a 44 percent active and ABC / Post by independent six out of 10 people say that adhere to his temperament White House.
Republican voters are starting to get used to the idea.
Republican voters when they wear their hats Political analysts say they think Trump is serious.
Last week a CNN / ORC is the best candidate to win the GOP nomination according to the survey who asked that four out of every 10 people said Trump is best.
a change since the end of July, they invested their money in four of the 10 people from Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, it was not very clear crystal ball of GOP voters.
At the time of the last election cycle, four out of 10 people between the Republicans thought would be a candidate, Rick Perry, by contrast, only 28 percent had chosen candidate Mitt Romney in the end.
Trump still the GOP's electoral campaign of the majority of voters seems to find plausible.
Republicans gather around another candidate even if they still almost everyone is eaten Trump.
Some experts also suggests may contribute to Trump's prominence in the scattered field and the fact that it is scattered among more than a dozen candidates support the anti-Trump.
However, a Monmouth University poll conducted at the beginning of September, in the case of Trump, and many potential Republican candidates in a head to head match shows that Trump received majority support at a time.
Carly Fiorina 13 points, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, 19 points and Jeb Bush finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie each passing scores of 33.
Ted Cruz draws.
the only candidate that can beat him?
In case of having to deal with a possible 19 points head I was going through in Carson businessman.
of Donald Trump's supporters say they make their decisions of the majority.
A new CBS, which was published on Tuesday / NYT poll, more than half of voters said they support the Trump show they locked their vote.
Obviously, a lot can happen and no one can say to change it really will not change its mind.
door open to replace 46 percent said they left the island.
Still Trump's biggest rival neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the two times closer to the electorate to vote for Trump to use that they make their decisions.
Six of the 10 Republicans on immigration says he disagrees with Trump.
Two months ago, the campaign announced Donald Trump speaking immigrants from Mexico "rapist" since the beginning of 2016 and the immigration issue was at the center of conversation.
Some think Trump will damage the very important speech that Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and re-branding effort.
However, on Monday the new ABC / Post poll compared to six out of 10 Republicans says it disagrees with immigration related issues Trump.
So long as the immigration issue remains on the agenda it looks like Trump will remain on the agenda.
anger Government climbs to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson, largely because of Republican votes they receive roughly half of the cases that are outside.
The new ABC on Monday / Post six out of every 10 Republicans in the survey, rather than someone who says they want someone from outside government experience.
And Washington also angry.
Two weeks ago, held in Iowa, the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg survey of three out of four Republicans in Iowa are angry with the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "extremely angry" showed.

In the previous five months longer than the start of the main race, yet he says it is too early to decide most Democratic voters which candidate they support.
However, Clinton's supporters have firmer ideas about their choices, rather than the other candidates.
Since the last month's CBS News is losing ground among a number of demographic groups Clinton, on the other hand there are some gains Sanders.
Clinton leads among women by a large margin and moderates, but closing this difference.
Support among men dropped substantially, and Sanders followed him only 5 points behind.
Clinton's advantage has evaporated Democratic voters under age 50, and he is now on an equal footing and Sanders.
But Clinton ahead by a large margin to qualify for elderly voters.
Clinton last month, between liberals Sander was moving in front of the stage, but now with two-digit Sanders 5-point lead in the group.
Nearly half of Democratic voters passionately at the national level if there is a candidate from the party that they will support Clinton.
Another cut by a quarter, 15 percent supported it only if certain conditions to support candidates.
Clinton does not support a six-percent cut.
Perhaps it did a Unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly inclined to support her passionately.
Clinton views were more mixed between those who currently support - only a quarter can support her passionately.

As a vice president with the potential for president, 57 percent of Democratic voters may want to see it happen in the race, but does not consider third, cutting this way.
When asked what is the second candidate for party elections to voters democrats, it finished on top.
More than half of those who supported Clinton by Sander said Biden will be open by far the second elections.
Biden does not enter the Democratic nomination race, Hillary Clinton Sanders superiority is increasing; a race in which the level of 20 points that the Biden Biden in a race where there is no rising 30 points.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with a chance of winning the general election the best; but this figure fell to this level from 78 percent last month.
Viewed from this angle, although a second ending a long way behind, but it increased the percentage of those who are most eligible candidates.
However, when asked what the most important thing in a candidate Democratic voters are keeping in front of eligibility issues.
Similar to last month's Democratic voters no candidate or candidates does not seem to be accepted as a candidate for the primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates in some of the main characteristics of the primary voters of their own party to perform well.
Majority Clinton, Sanders and Biden is honest and trustworthy, he is also, as people with strong leadership qualities.

Democratic voters are also generally Clinton, Biden sees Sanders and in line with their ideology.
All the Democrats have no idea about the extent Sanders quarter of the electorate.
Minister of Foreign Affairs during the most personal e-mail addresses while continuing questions about the use and server issues Democratic voters find an explanation satisfactory and said that affected their opinion of it.
But that's a different story in the US media in general.

People's views on this issue in March, was split into trouble shortly after being taken under the spotlight.
Most Americans contention email says that affect their general views on Clinton, compared to 36 percent on the other hand has increased at a negative ideas.
These are generally Republicans, and more than six in 10 people say that disrupted their views on Clinton.
Clinton, although also seen as honest and trustworthy by voters of their own party in general these issues among registered voters is still a problem: only 32% while seeing him honest and trustworthy, this figure last month by eight points, has fallen since the 15 points from May .
Sixty two percent of registered voters do not find him honest and trustworthy.
They also can not find 55 percent of registered voters in all countries Trump honest and trustworthy.

When the Fed increases interest rates, what will happen?
Interest rates rise with income climbed bond bull market is upside down, the economy also registers decline.
We know that.
If we do not know what takes place and at what time will continue until all of them.
History, especially in the economy, provides very little information about the timing.
Decline, decline to occur as soon as 11 months after the first interest rate increase, which has also been kept as long as 86 months.
US Federal Reserve's interest in increasing the rate of aggressiveness has been decisive in the response is usually, though not always in the economy and financial assets.
US central bank officials when he began to increase investors' interest not emphasize strongly the need to focus on how long this is why the process of normalization.
the fact that a number of variables.
But the result, market participants might think that the exaggerated increase flurry of interest.
Capital Economics, Global Chief Economist in a note to Julian Jessop customers, "since the global financial crisis by some of the Fed's first rate hike 'cheap money' era is bound to be interpreted as pointing out that the end of," he said.
On the contrary, we do not expect US interest rates more slowly returning to normal, but still feared that most of the lower level appears to be seismic shocks.
Still, I can not say it will not be in effect.
Based on past trends, the reaction may give some areas of the economy as follows:
As seen in the market over the past month, expects to increase the interest rate can destabilize things for a while.
The impact of increasing interest rates would not be so obvious at the time.
Fed after the increase in new research on what happens to Deutsche Bank analysts, "Equity returns of the observed was 12-24 months hesitation train after the first interest rate hike, which could be this reflects a pause in monetary policy."
Bob from Nuvem Asset Management analyst Doll, according to a recent analysis by Barron's' in the share market more than the last 35 years is usually percent-saving sharp rise of 14 after civarı- 250 days while moving in a straight line to increase interest rates (average of 2.6 percent increase), and a return of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles return to normal if after 500 days.
Deutsche, the effective interest rate increase cycle, he said on shares held extinction bring more flares up during the next stage.
Setbacks are a fact of economic life, but also help them to raise interest rates.
Fed's current situation, not previously available and will accelerate the decline is faced with certain situations.
The most notable of gross domestic product for the Fed rate hike is at the lowest level so far today.
According to Deutsche Bank, held since 1950 in the 118 interest rate increases, the gross domestic product of the year fell by just under 4.5 per cent of the nominal year twice.
Although if realized in the second quarter of 3.6 per cent in 2015, to be persistent in this case according to the Atlanta Fed is expected by very few are watching to 1.5 percent in the third quarter.
According to Deutsch, the interest rate may increase risk in such a delicate economic environment and "this time will be different" may lead to questions.
The Fed's interest rate hikes for a year awaiting the attention of market participants this week, which will end on Thursday, the Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
Many strategists and economists believe that fomc'n's meeting approved an increase in this, though, futures trading suggests only a 25 percent probability.
The report, "1950 In our research, since any increase cycle that occurred up to the present super upward trend cycle and in which gross domestic product, begins recovery after reaching rapidly to the pre-recession peak," he said.
Rather, it was an example of the slow recovery from the worst recession that occurred in a period of unprecedented.
Actual cycle, the Fed had expected since the last recession was the longest cycle was 35 months at the longest cycle we are in the cycle is in -records and 74 are still pending.
Was destabilized by the expected interest rate increase in the fixed income market and the layout looks a little bit on equities.
The main difference is that when you change the course of Fed policy is in effect share in bonds to be seen more quickly.
The first increase loop / fall when bond yields do not change direction now.
At the end of the rate hike cycle instantly falls in bond yields, "said Deutsch.
increases in interest rates by the Charles Schwab strategist longer and shorter term returns between bonds closer to flatten the slope.
We analyzed in high-yield bonds are generally said to perform better in such an environment Schwab analyst Kathy Jones, but "still careful about achieving returns," he said.
Interestingly, Jones market expectations of the Fed's policy think it is already adapted.
"In addition to the decline in the dollar's strength and inflation expectations, the market has arranged according to various signals that tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates rise, the yield curve correctly, credit spreads widened and increased volatility - all the features to be seen in the market when the Fed policy tightening.
When viewed from a wide angle, the company makes most of its jobs in the United States will gain from interest rate increases and local products will be more attractive.
The status of a multinational company with a large debt will be worse, because rising dollar will make goods more expensive in global markets and the debt will be more expensive.
Goldman Sachs analysts in a report prepared for the customers' history, 'quality' can live shows poor performance of stocks at the beginning of such an increase, "he said.

Debt has become a big issue.
According to Goldman, the candidate to see most vulnerable companies with a high proportion of floating rate debt.

Before making a fun program of the Agency "to find a hit of his own blood" language, he said.

The United Arab Emirates and Pakistan to play a challenging task, but after the tour to see the British team not selected in a re-think of the last time cards experienced 3-0 Test series defeat.
Still, I'm not leaving out the possibility of an away win.
Alastair Cook's team can be more inexperienced batting line compared to three years ago but have good returning players and strong collective understanding of the game; they can not heal the wounds of 2012 provides only a little youth induced optimism.
Ball games, developing games as Moeen Ali spinner and Adil Rashid Trial unknown level of quality, even if it represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth England output from the trial team and was replaced by Alex Hales
Adam Lyth the dismissal decision is a difficult decision for me to be analyzed as head coach in Yorkshire.
Trial of seven were against the two best attacks in harsh conditions and are judged according to a simple but inevitable result of the fact that there cricketers.
For example, there was no question mark about Joe Root, the announcement must be made thicker because - as I said before - the players were their own best choices.
After a few fifty-point series could see that extends the Lyth career but had to self-determination.
If more work for Yorkshire hope you get another opportunity.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss, although it did not show the best performance praised the player's attitude does not surprise me; First of all he's a team guy.
Answering the question of how long you have to take note of striking a trial.
Lythe - like predecessor Sam Robson - took seven caps, on the other hand, Nick Compton took nine.
Compton Rematched only chance of the match caught.
Jonathan Trott for single pain can be felt first in the Caribbean to go to England - Lyth at the summit of the form - but spent this wasted opportunity now in the past.
Alex Hales coming and a high kicker for me.
X-factor in the quality of a cricketer, and it is the beginning of this season, scored 236 in the Trent Bridge pitch against us, we have seen in Yorkshire.
At least with that same opportunity should be taken to her before, but this of course depends on the formation team in the United Arab Emirates.
Moeen's four quick handling the extra game will keep turning way to get the idea worked, making opening the batting alongside Cook and I am not against it.
I do not understand why a shooter can not shoot here, even the left bracket already showed how good a cricketer.
Moeen, the city could do the job for Worcestershire but has seen a number 3 for them, and not too much difference.
Former teammate Justin Langer played the first 38 trial before the first decline in output at the start of 2001.
Three hundred series immediately grabbed and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari team comes rotator replacement game and surprised me as an impressive young man in restricted during my interview with him.
people raw statistics - batting average and 31 balls in 35 average - Visible and thought it was a turning degaje but not too many games that raise their hands and player selections made since the young.
This tour will learn much.
Away from the team, England seems to have made a few shrewd additions to their coach his team.
Sri Lanka is to be appointed as adviser to the strikers to Mahela Jayawardene's match could be an ingenious experiment measures.
He is one of the most charming guy in the game; in all circumstances and it will bring a full experience acquired against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood tour is coming to the white ball up and brings a brutal swiftness order to both energy game.
Always her, whether I thought that was born coach wants players to international cricket and have an understanding of the world can be taken as guidelines to Mahela.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room before even spoken messages ilets, it can bring innovation to the team.
Colly'n from Durham's team-mate Ben Stokes to rest for a one-day games, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it.
Although not everyone agrees, plans, coaches and not made by selecting players.
And, as you must remember that the players depending on the results of their work.
Such decisions are never taken easily.

Experts have criticized the UK Public Health e-cigarette research
Researchers, an agency funded by his government, the tobacco industry in connection with a meeting of 12 people found that e-cigarettes, they said the alleged 95% less harmful than smoking.
In the British Medical Journal (BMJ) by experts, the UK Public Health's (PHA) used in the report on e-cigarette joined in criticizing the Lancet evidence.
PHA, "examining in detail the evidence" as defined by "turning point" in the nature of the report was released last month.
But some researchers have questioned the integrity of the data and drew attention to the links between the tobacco industry and some experts.
The Lancet medical journal last month's editorial PhEur of the main results based on "exceptionally rotten foundation" was targeted.
Another two researchers wrote in the BMJ allegations "Does the sand or rock Is it built on top of you" he questioned.
London hygiene and public health professor at the European School of Tropical Medicine and Martin McKee, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool Sunni Simon Capewell said: "The basic principle of public health policy is based on the evidence of effectiveness."
PhEur the public "according to the best estimates about 95% of e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking" in terms of evidence of the allegations and said it would be based on a detailed review of the forecast modeling.
The fact that nicotine-containing multi-criteria decision analysis to create a synthesis of views on losses related to various products (MC) gathered together to develop a model emerges from a meeting of 12 people; The results of the meeting are summarized in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell, one of the sponsors of the meeting, general manager, for an independent investigation earlier reported that receive funding from British American Tobacco said it was a company called Health euroswiss.
He also said it also approved the sinking of the public health white paper in a sustainability report.
That reported receiving funding from one of the 12 people on an e-cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris International Meeting in advance but it did add that the funds received from the tobacco company reported.
how information that the panel members selected photo provided but these include some of the industry fund article reported that the e-cigarette is known, including some giants.
Some other people present at the meeting is not known for its expertise in tobacco control.
The person responsible for tobacco PhEur meeting also attended.
McKee and Capewell, the group wrote the research article "effectively" "concrete evidence about the dangers of many products based on multiple criteria" lack wrote that he accepted that.
However, none of these connections are not discussed in the PHA report or restrictions.
McKee and Capewell, "e-cigarettes children or that there is no evidence to suggest that a transition to smoke for non-smokers persons" of allegations that he said it was too early.
director of health and welfare in the PhEur Prof Kevin Fenton said earlier answers given to the allegations in the BMJ.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two people who are lifelong smokers die due to this addiction.
All evidence to indicate that smoking-caused health risks are small compared with, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PhEur has a clear task: public, especially in a period with a lot of confusion about the losses when compared with tobacco, as indicated by the evidence and to inform about the things that show.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die from diseases linked to smoking and smoking with NHS £ 2 billion a year "is going to cost.
Available evidence - although e-cigarettes on the risk it carries only a small part of the harm caused by smoking - we bring a clearly fulfill our national responsibility by putting forward.
Previous Channel 4 chief told the BBC he should quit EastEnders
Previous Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson BBC's EastEnders and The Voice said, and advertising of competitors must leave the publication of such programs for hit programs like Albert Square series "could give his right arm for," he said.
Johnson, of the type made by other British publishers only said that the license fee should be used to make programs.
BBC, against the maximum-rated program of its competitors in the precious interval, followed by a smaller group of viewers criticized for the possibility to put the public service channels like BBC4 programs.
BBC director general Tony Hall, with other organizations of the organization wanted to say that after more cooperation; Johnson, to create a bond with the BBC, Channel 4, on their own time during the six years he said it in a way so-called fail.
Johnson, during a query regarding the BBC's future in the House of Lords communications committee, "I'm struggling with the idea of BBC programs to be shown in order to clearly implicit subsidies by competitors and publishing," he said.
If you keep the medium or long term a good idea to make sure that my application licensing fees, the exit to the others, or at least should be reduced to order the program.
The Voice broadcasting in primetime as wide a range because they want me to provide future support.
The main idea here is based on the idea that no one else broadcast ridiculous and clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why it should be funded through the program can be funded without the help of a regressive tax.
The Voice is one of EastEnders as is done in other companies and in reality.
other channels Honestly give his right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how public service broadcasting.
I do not think it will detract from the BBC at all.
Channel 4 in 2004, a number of entrepreneurs who managed until 2010, Johnson, "where employees from the people's passion and the approach of this work because he sees the best way to ensure long-term support," accused ran the BBC's rating after.
The BBC's most popular programs on the reviews, the BBC's former Sky executives using the MACTAGGART course in Edinburgh in 2003 to offer to sell programs such as EastEnders repeats the reviews of Tony Ball.
Johnson BBC that the more appropriate public service programs bbc4 to go and where audience measurement can not be done, but that meet their tax amnesty and license fee income of 4 billion pounds, he said they could argue for continuing their ostensible piety task of providing the ground, and added: "We are of course no one we do all these programs that faint trace. "
They put one of them in no time gaps will be watching.
About the license fee, Johnson said the committee, said: "You are, I invite you to find a more regressive system that provides the best benefits for the people.
Of course, all of you think, we all think, is a great value £ 150 a year, but I wonder if the reason for doing it was a lot of money for people who are 150 pounds is too much BBC monitoring them.
It also offers evidence before the committee on Tuesday, Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, the BBC's "inform, educate and to entertain" for Reith he said it should revise its mission.
A bit of the BBC's output is now officially classified as training - said that it was 1% and 0.1% of radio TV output - and of public service broadcasting in Australia and Canada that it should be the front foot and that "disclosure, disclosure and train "that need to be replaced.
about partnership, Elstein, the BBC's TV but a handful to do something about the Promar shown and all online monitoring to ensure that it could enter into partnerships with advertising publishers, he said.
'Sonogenetik' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
It is seen how they change direction when they hit the sound vibration of the nematodes in the video.
maggots with scientists genetically modified the sound wave can be controlled by bursts of nervous system were raised.
Tiny nematodes are changing direction as soon as they hit the treble sound vibrations can not hear people.
Vibrations are running audio to respond to ultrasonic waves that carry membrane channels genetically modified engine by activating nerve cells.

The researchers said they proved the power of the new procedure Sonogenetik name of the worm; so that a series of ultrasound brain can be used to activate the outside of the body and heart muscle cells.
California, located in La Jolla, Salk Institute researchers Sreekanth Chalas new Guardian told the people to treat one day the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, this procedure is that electrical vibrations into the brain can take the place of deep-brain stimulation is an intrusive procedure.
Nematodes often do not react beyond the sound, but they react when they found it surrounded by a liquid containing Chalas new microscopic bubbles.
Find the bubbles that strengthens beyond sound waves pass through and thus allows the worm.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves, some maggots found in the membranes of cells and TRP-4 ion channels influence the structure is called.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, the sound waves that allows the cells to activate the opening of the ion channel and is connected to.
To create audio nematodes that are controlled by infrared, Chalas NEW some motor neurons TRP ion channels substituted-4 form worms genetically engineered to provide transport.
When applied to the modified creatures beyond sound, the sound waves are amplified and transmitted by micro-bubbles into maggots and have run here replaced motor neurons.
This procedure is run by scientists of the neurons with light vibration and groundbreaking provides the closing optogenetics has similarities with a tool.
But Chalas new sonogenetig says there might be some benefits against these techniques.
Unlike the light to be transmitted through an optical fiber at the desired point in the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through unhindered, tissues and thus can be sent out of the skull into the brain.
Chalas NEW "using gene therapy and therapeutic virus, we believe that sound temporarily be sensitive to the infrared signal of the clinical environment, human neurons targeted for certain neurological treatments," he said.
Other applications also add muscle cells and insulin-producing cells can be focused on.

Finally, in a report released in July, falling oil prices of $ 200 billion 46 outlining the major energy investments that led to the suspension of Wood Mackenzie, the figure until the end of 2015, new research conducted reveals that we would arrive.
Accordingly, the last six months of 2015 than 22 big projects delayed, the total since the start of the 2014 collapse of oil prices in 68 major projects was suspended.
The value of this project is approximately $ 400 billion.
2.9 MILLION BARRELS DAILY
The effect of lower oil prices, the company plans "cruel" is highlighted in the study are recorded as deepwater development projects in the most affected by the project.
The suspended projects corresponding to a total 27 billion barrels, while crude oil equivalent reserves, 2.9 million barrels of daily oil production in 2025 is thus deferred.
According to the survey, most of the final investment decision for the project in question in 2017 and later postponed first production target for the record between 2020 to 2023.
Deferred between 68 projects, scheduled for the next 5 years, $ 170 billion, the report highlighted that of the potential investment, "170 billion dollars, the majority of deepwater projects."
It is too high because of the up-front investment costs.
"70 per cent of the deep-sea expenditure" in the first place in Nigeria, Angola and the United States accounted for petroleum-based projects in the Gulf of Mexico "is called.
According to the survey, most deferred inventory countries with oil projects in Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries, deferred liquid (oil), with almost 90 percent of reserves.

EYES IN IRAN

When we returned, we see a completely different scenario this week.
Oil prices saw gold for the first time since 2004, $ 30, it's also the main reason was the explosion of production in the United States embargo against Iran and depart from.
Therefore eyes on Iran.
In case of increasing oil exports from Iran, the oil market is already quite saturated expressed much more oil will be spilled.
This can cause us to fall below the level of the surprises of the price today.
Some analysts do not want to give free rein to the market share in Saudi Arabia, Iran will further pumping a lot of oil and Iran - he says there may be a price war between Saudi Arabia.

How to evaluate the semester semester break?
Students should evaluate how the semester break? the question of education experts and students we asked coach Murat Aydin.
Spring Break just for students; recreation, entertainment, television and computer time at the beginning and should not be considered passing.
Semester holiday; To prepare for the new school year and the past is a very important opportunity to review.
Leisure called semester break also personality development, information is also an important opportunity to acquire skills and hobbies.
Make Semester rubric.
Do you, write down everything you plan and try to practice.
It will enjoy it and be confident that you will have a very efficient one semester period.
Now primarily YGS-LYS preparation of a semester, the student must be how efficient it is time to talk to friends.
Because YGS-LYS friends preparing for the exam questions are coming up to us in that direction; "How should we evaluate this period, we did plenty of questions to solve our issues are missing or need to take care of them?"
And to respond to them as well as efficient to spend a period writing with our first Let's entrance exam is prepared to recommend to friends.
Test preparation process which was supposed to be a process that began in the 9th grade in normal circumstances we try to complete it much last 1 year; this is the last year for us more effective, efficient and compel us to spend time using more accurate.
Besides the preparation for senior school exams also have to carry out with the written work.
School graduates who have completed at least 1 times although the exam (even if YGS-LYS) entered and have experienced, graduates will be prepared to take it again year also bears critical importance to him.
Because most graduate students and their families 'O' is seen as the last chance of the year and this constitutes a greater stress.
Studying; student, taking pleasure in itself because it felt compelled to do just that and so they are usually working, which is always left to the last, but it; engaged in regular, if habitual domestic students has already become quite a task, and this is always the plan when and what to do.
Now we have ahead of us the semester break and we should consider it in the best way.
Of the time we have for this must be a plan that will enable us to manage better.
Half of Year Holiday Study:
Everyone should make an appropriate plan as their priority status.
1 st what was done, what was left incomplete; day, week and 15-day time should be planned.
During this period, both subjects should be again the question must be both solutions.
At the same time not missing too many students can also solve the average 1-2 trial exams.
The Eliminate your missing Subject: Research; 75 percent of what people learn in a week, a day, 66 percent, also shows that 54 per cent forgotten in an hour.
Remember the best and most effective way to eliminate is to be repeated.
Especially a lot of mistakes from the past issues that students should give priority to the general working again.
Identify your priorities and plan the day to day issues missing, place the subject every day and take care of them necessarily.
This planning will relax you both academically and psychologically.
When placing your plan issues also make sure that the issues that you make the most mistakes.
Because so long in coming when you will not be a holiday period.
Questions Solutions Structure:
Subject to resolve the question again until t is very important.
Because we understand how much work we do, but we can see from the feedback we receive through the questions we have to solve.
Do not forget to put a certain number of questions solution every day.
The number of questions to solve vary according to the work you do on that day; We have to do a weight issue date you may not be able to solve a lot of questions but I still work at least one day subject to a certain extent for us to see how we learn problem solving work.
Practice Exam for the Resolution:
Another study done in the half-year vacation will be to solve the trial exams.
Although all of the unfinished issues, at least if you can try solutions lecture course exam.
Let's say; You take care of the largely Turkish courses; prepared 40 questions test can resolve the Turkish language.
And definitely make the time to work while doing it.
40 Turkish first question if you can solve goal 60 minutes later you get to solve in less than a few minutes if possible.
Holiday and Leisure Plan:
Holiday means, of course, does not mean just course work; in a few day vacation, you should reserve for your relaxation and hobbies.
The only course of trying to pass a holiday period will prevent you from being discharged, and the rest.
Therefore, you can spare yourself a special time in your plan should be.
reading books, watching television, surfing the Internet can be in your ta plan, most importantly, what separates how much time to take it.
I have not had a productive first term he will be a little advice to friends.
If; My first time I did not go very well, did not you say so much my work and missing the great opportunity this semester breaks for you.
But primarily you need to decide it and you believe it.
Turkey football super league goals in the 2009-2010 season, the most laid between the 76th and 90th minutes.
Now you finished the match with their answer questions you ask and you going to the locker room, or match is still going on and you have many minutes you take even goals?
I think coach a football team was defeated or a classic use of the players commented that "now we will look at the next matches," nobody wants to say.
The only thing you can do now to look past the left in front of you should be run do not walk.
If we are to summarize what we said:
1) Make a semester vacation plans as a priority,
2) passing through the subject again, you know, do,
3) to take care of your missing issues,
4) Question solving issues reinforce the structure,
5) Solve the trial exams
6) Read the book,
7) set new goals for the new term,
8) yourself, hobbies and take your time on the things you enjoy,
9) Take the time to family and friends,
10) Take time to social and cultural activities (cinema, sports, theater, concerts, trips, picnics etc.).

Only a month ago, the Fed this month, it looked as if the road ratio increasing by 0.25%; this way slowly tightening of monetary conditions, it would be a small step to strengthen the recovery in the United States.
Yellen said, liberals in a more economical process despite complaints concerning the necessity of the spring this year and said it expects the rate increase in early summer.
Despite the reduction in the rate of job creation in August, growth in the labor market was stable this year.
The unemployment rate last month fell to 5.1%, the lowest level in seven years and say that the Fed was close to full employment levels.
Salary increases showed signs of improvement.
And although it remained below the inflation target of 2% per annum central bank, the Fed policymakers are sharply decreasing said that an important reason for the temporary effects of oil prices.
Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdso the economy "can cope with higher rates and despite the narrowness of the labor market needs it," he said.
But at the end of the world financial markets last month began to shake after going to the devaluation of China's currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index, due to investors' fear of a slowing Chinese economy pull down the global growth of 16% in May it fell below record levels.
The market is now under Dow's high level of almost 10% in May, jumped back in a way.
market turmoil for the Fed policy-makers, the calculation of the time the interest rate will be increased to make it more complicated.
UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, senior research partner and a former Fed official Stephen D. Oliner "The last few weeks to know that the financial markets in the Chinese economy and the economy weakened by the lack of news about this meeting can be narrowed a bit," he said.
Now these effects estimates will wait for at least a month to manage better.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and there are almost no data on hand to rely on the disposal date of advanced development in China," Olin said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's primary concern, so there should not be a factor in the technical aspects of land-making process.
But in reality, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
impact in recent years, the central bank was too big.
Until then, the only hint from Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, triggered by the Fed's monetary expansion worldwide market shock "could reduce", respectively.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, not only to follow developments elsewhere Fed officials also read other central banks to better manage the global economy and can also be expected to consult with experts.
Asset management firm Envestnet Inc.'s global strategy chief Zachary Karabelli the decision-making process, "a lot of talent to science," he said.
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA. President Jeffrey Lacker this month, "the Fed's move unseen past the financial markets associated with economic fundamentals that overreacting," he noted.
Policy makers who are members of the Federal Open Market Committee has the right to vote and rate increase that pressure for Lacke, found for example in reference to the 1998-99 decision.
Lacker, "despite advice defined limited to the US growth" rate indicator during three meetings of the Asian financial crisis, the Fed has caused the interruption points to 0.75%, "he said.
One year after Fed officials took back the cuts.
One of the former members of the Bank of England rate setting committees Adam S. Posen "The Fed, only during major crises such as the 2008 market meltdown must put financial stability concerns to the fore," he said.
He said recent turmoil does not come close to this level.
Markets do not want to really stay in the event of a rate increase because it is afraid to go to the president of the Institute for International Economics Peterson said disgruntled Posen.
The Central Bank Act has still not talking about fiscal balance and changing the two powers and so far I do not think they should make a move in this direction.

Moderate weight loss in obese patients with diabetes surgery can help
According to a new study in type 2 diabetes moderately obese patients to be seen the benefits of bariatric surgery can take at least five years.
However, moderately obese patients with diabetes compared to untreated patients after surgery bariatric surgery is too early to say whether they live longer.
Surgery carried out on the JAMA article, who wrote the new study and an expert in bariatric surgery Dr. According to Robin Blackstone "It takes a long time to manifest itself in death rates."
Weight loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, uses a variety of methods to reduce the diameter of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and restricts the ability of the body to digest the food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery proved to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes but most research body mass index (BMI) was conducted with severely obese persons who are 35 or older.
BMI, which measures weight on the proportion sizes, from 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal.
BMI of 25 or above indicates a person is overweight, and above 30 are considered obese if the BMI.
BMI can be calculated from the following link: 1.usa.gov/1d0zqdv.
In the new study, Taiwan's full-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital, since 2007, type 2 diabetes and moderate in the treatment of obese patients with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy surgeries - has used the data obtained from the experiments they compare.
The average of the operation since the end of the fifth year of the study to the UN declined to 31 from 24.5.
In contrast, non-surgical BMI of treated diabetes has remained stable at 29 percent.
Diabetes was completely resolved in 36% of the operative part is 28%.
They treated group compared to the medical way diabetes is only partially dissolved completely in 1% and 2% only.
In addition, the author claimed that control blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol, "the group has seen surgical intervention" in general was better.
Researchers also imaging the blood level of hemoglobin A1c reflects blood sugar level in patients over time.
Keeping hemoglobin A1c of less than 7% of the researchers says that the best.
Postoperative hemoglobin A1c went down about 6 percent from 9 percent on average.
In the group receiving medical treatment it has remained constant at around 8 percent.
However, this improved with better A1c hemoglobin levels "glycemic control", who conducted the research, Dr. According to Hsu Chih-Cheng and his teammates it did not reduce the mortality rate in five years.
The research team compared the findings with those two types of surgery available.
The fifth bill, the tube has given more weight than the group with gastric bypass grafting surgery group (18.7 to 14.2 kg), BMI (7,4'y 5.1) and likewise in hemoglobin A1c (3% 1 2.1%) higher than the decline seen in its entirety and is higher than the probability of regression of diabetes (46.9 to 16.7%).
What a benefit that remain alive at the end of the fifth year after surgery research concern that Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Dr. Blackstone, in overweight patients than in Sweden, according to a study that has been conducted, he said that the current data extend the lifetime of the operation.
Swedes in this study, patients who have had bariatric surgery in obese were less likely to die within 15 years compared to 29 percent who saw a group of other more traditional therapies.
Although the benefits of this new study about their survival surgery patients did not show what happened though, is relevant in this case by Blackstone and reassuring for people under 35 BMI.
The most crucial part of the article is also here, because this surgery is safe to say that the UN is in the group with a lower risk of death or renal dysfunction was observed in any increase, he said.
Blackstone, added that people and doctors of the patient's BMI from 27 to 30 under the weight gain issue with the fall should begin to take seriously.
I think people have waited long enough for this matter seriously, he said.
I think after collecting bodies of obesity and genetic changes in the body associated with diabetes that makes it really difficult to reverse this.
