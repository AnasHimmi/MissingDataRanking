8 poll figures that indicate that serious of Donald Trump
Some tried to brand as a shimmering him.
Others like it was a joke to him.
And for some support for the explosion.
Some of the Republican Donald Trump in the polls in trying to get down this ( yet) didn't work.
Her most recent national poll showed Donald Trump's leadership of 11 in the double digits, and some of them a chance to be a candidate for real estate emperor's really starting to ask.
Of course it's too early in the election cycle.
The Republican candidate Trump, none of this doesn't mean to win the race.
Experts at this time in 2011 for Herman Cain to rise and rise of Rick Perry, both of what they meant it was just one state didn't win the nomination, even in the process.
In the general election problem, too, and there's lots of reasons.
But Jeb Bush's super PAC group and economic conservative group that groups like Club for Growth and the enduring power of the Trump they realise that they start spending dollars to bring him down.
Here's some recent polls showing that it wasn't just passing through the Emperor of real estate:
Rates of prefer Trump 180 degrees changed.
Donald Trump declared his candidacy in the middle of June, made in the Monmouth University poll, just before with a positive vision for the emperor had shown that two real estate 10 Republican.
In the middle of July, this is 40 per cent tı.
In the month of August was 52 percent.
10 Republican positive views about Donald Trump now six.
Three of the roughly 10 meant it was negative opinions.
Up high in early stages and these figures are watching.
Week in a Quinnipiac poll in Iowa, the present 60 per cent of the Republican there showed that they prefer the Donald Trump.
Two in three voters the GOP nomination, they could be satisfied with Trump.
A CNN / ORC poll in the present week, 67 percent of the Republican candidate if Trump would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" they said they were going.
Only two of the 10 if that candidate if "they give a damn" they said.
Just me on the same level of enthusiasm Trump and Carson (43 percent said they would be "enthusiastic" for Trump while this is 40 per cent).
The nearest enthusiastic, the other person?
Compared to just 21 percent, Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters, the favorite candidate Jeb Bush if the institution, "they weren't going to be happy" or "they'd be upset," he said.
The Republican majority trump nature, don't see as a problem.
Donald Trump, ABC news from / The Washington Post were criticized for fancy language and insults on Monday questioned the Republican polls indicate the Emperor of real estate, 52 per cent think that you have the right man to be president.
The convention in the country's first party to do the same number goes here in Iowa last week, according to the Quinnipac 52 per cent think it's going to be the Republican leader of her personality.
He will serve as an 44 percent still don't think you have personality, according to ABC / Post and the independents, six of 10 people in his character he says it's not to the White House.
Republican voters are starting to get used to that idea.
Republican voters when they got their hats political expert Trump's serious, they think.
A CNN / ORC poll last week, according to the GOP nomination, when asked who he is the best candidate to win four of 10 are Trump's says it's the best.
Four out of 10 people their money by the end of July where Jeb Bush have been a change.
Full disclosure: In the past, the voters, GOP wasn't really clear crystal ball.
At that time in 10 Republicans in the last election cycle, Rick Perry's candidate for it, four of whom she thought it would be only 28 per cent in the end, the candidate chose Mitt Romney.
The majority of voters the GOP still trump's campaign found yatkın görülüyor.
Other Republicans around a candidate they will still even trump almost beat everybody.
Some experts, could be found scattered in the field and contribute to get ahead of Trump suggests support for Trump against more than a dozen candidates when it disintegrated in the real.
But a Monmouth University poll in the beginning of September, Trump and many Republican candidates head to head in a possible match, in case of Trump every time, suggests the majority support.
Carly Fiorina yı by 15 points with 13 points, 14 points to Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Walker and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie's 19 points as the end, each one's 33 points.
Ted Cruz and tie.
The only candidate who can beat her?
Me, if there's a possible head to head in 19 points Carson businessman geçiyor.
Donald Trump's supporters saying that the vast majority of decisions.
A new CBS / NYT poll published on Tuesday, with more than half of voters from the Trump show what they say they locked their votes.
Frankly, it can happen a lot to change that will not change his mind and no one really can't say.
46 percent said they left the door open to change candidate.
Trump's biggest competitor, neurosurgeon Carson but still they gave me that their decision to vote for Trump voters are twice as close.
10 Republican six says he agrees with Trump on immigration.
Two months ago Donald Trump campaign ad "rapist" immigrants from Mexico to since 2016 and the central issue in the talks said immigration was.
Some Hispanic voters away from his speech, Trump's most important and rebranding efforts thinks that would damage the Republican Party.
But new ABC / Post poll on Monday six in 10 Republican issues about immigration, Trump says he agrees with.
I mean, on the agenda on immigration, as long as Trump appears to be the agenda.
The government's anger to new heights of climbing.
Donald Trump and Carson, largely due to me from the outside of the vote, roughly half of Republican situations is they're taking.
New ABC / Post poll in a statement on Monday, the government every 10 Republican six instead of someone with experience say they want someone from outside.
And they're angry at Washington.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll conducted in Iowa in Iowa, 54 per cent of all three Republicans in Congress every four Republican angry they are "dissatisfied" and 21 per cent of showed "extremely angry".

In the United States, and when you lose in front of closed but he broke his racket disappointment to hear that's not the first player who broke a racket and Thanassi and I know that he knows enough to hear proud of it.
But in reality extremely provocative, Harrison, and with the others in the United States under the circumstances he handled it pretty damn well and I think a lot of the credit he deserves.
Around a great team, he has a wonderful family and I think a little too much on it went.
Even though he was 19 years old, extremely mature, is working very hard, and adapt in the team, there's nothing wrong with the other players are treated with respect, in the locker room is perfectly stable and mature, making the grueling training, a young and I think he deserves to be judged on their criteria.

Healy, "First of all the team's [ Kyrgios] around the contention that aren't we want to focus fully to the game," he said.

A quarter support with conditions a 15 per cent while the other schlacht him only if a candidate in support.
Six is a certain percentage of don't support Clinton.

More than half of Clinton's supporters might be by far of ending the second elections, according to Sander said.
The Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton if Sanders doesn't get involved in ending supereminence is increasing. Ending in a race where there's a level with 20 points in a race without ending up 30 points.
Fifty percent of Democratic voters five Clinton as the candidate who see the best chance to win general election. But this number was down to this level, from 78 per cent last month.

Democratic candidates or candidates primary voters own parties, some of the main characteristics between the candidates in a good performance.
Clinton, Sanders and honest and trustworthy, and the ending of the people who see them as strong leadership qualities.
Between the three ending integrity of the first in line to Clinton over leadership, strong.
According to thirty percent of Democratic voters, Clinton honest and trustworthy, not even half as Sanders (15 per cent) say the same for the 27 percent, while this doesn't have an opinion on.
Clinton, Sanders and Democratic voters in general, ending his own ideology, and see in the same direction.

But that general American public opinion, in a different story.
Half of Americans now satisfied with only a third when his explanation, satisfied.
People view on this problem in March, shortly after being taken under the microscope was split.
Most of the American general views about the Clinton e-mail from the other side of contention, telling youdown at increased to 36 percent negative for ideas.
These are the Republicans in general, and more than six in 10 people saying that the opinions about Clinton.
Clinton as honest and trustworthy by his own party as much as voters registered with the voters in general, though it's still a problem: Her honest and trustworthy, while only 32 percent last month, according to see that figure fell 15 points and eight points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't find her honest and trustworthy.
When all the same in the country, 55 per cent of registered voters don't find in Trump's honest and trustworthy.

What will happen on the Fed raising interest rates?
The bull market, and the economy with rising interest rates climb revenues decline if bonds tumble kaydeder.
We know that.
And what we do not know what all this and for how much will continue.
History, especially in the economy, very little information about the timing has to offer.
Retrogadation, the first interest rate increase as quickly as possible for 11 months after setback in 86 months took so long as it happens, have been, too.
The US central bank of the Fed raise interest rates in the economy and financial assets in response to aggression, usually without all the time has been key.
The US central bank officials began the process of normalization, and not when interest rates for investors to increase the violence that is why the exclamation point, should focus on how long it takes.
It's a real variety of variables.
However, market participants may think as a result, the interest rate increase rush Ain overrated.
Capital Economics, global chief economist Julian Jessop clients in a note, "from the global financial crisis since the Fed's first interest the increase by some money'ucuz" interpreted as to point out the point that the end of it is inevitable, "he said.
On the contrary, the United States, but we don't expect to get back to normal interest rates more slowly with low levels of seismic coup, many of them still fear there appear to be.
Still, you can't say we won't be the effects.
Some areas, to give the economy based on past trends response:
Commercially, as seen in over recent months have to wait for a while to increase interest rates, some things unstable.
Not that specific moment, the impact that increased interest in.
After the Fed increase about what was going to happen in a new study, Deutsche Bank analysts "özkaynak bring the first interest rate increase next 12-24 months pause train was there appear to be, which may reflect the hesitation in his monetary policy."
The nuvi Asset Management analyst Bob Doll, Barron's'da market share in the last 35 years, according to a current analysis more generally - 14 percent and sharp spike in interest - 250 days later, it's a straight line is enhanced, is moving in ( the average 2.6 per cent increase) and 500 days after the last six in the loop, and on average 14.4 per cent, helped bring back to normal.
Deutsche, the shares of the effect on interest in the next stages of the cycle of auction to be no more the apparent bring because he said.
Economic setbacks, it's a fact of life, but interest in increase could help them.
The Fed, which does not exist before the current situation, and will speed up regression is facing some situations.
Most notably, the Fed to increase the interest gross domestic product to be in the lowest level ever.
According to Deutsche Bank, which took place since 1950, 118 interest rate increase year over year, only two times, in nominal gross domestic product dropped below 4.5 percent.
As much as 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015 occurred in this situation very few are to be permanent if the Fed, according to Atlanta and the third quarter at 1.5 percent expected by watching.
Interest rates to increase in such a sensitive economic environment, according to the Deutsche could be risky and "should be different this time," can lead to the question.
The Fed's interest for a year to increase the market's attention this week, which ends on Thursday the Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
Most economists believe the FOM meeting with the strategy that an increase in trade, even if just 25 percent possibility approve vadeli pointing.
The report, "since 1950 we did in the research, to the present day, which all increase cycles Super a rising trend cycle, and gross domestic product, başlayan recovery after a summit before reaching fast decline," he said.
On the contrary, this is, for example, which took place at a time of the worst setback in a slow pace of recovery happened.
Since the current cycle, the Fed's latest setback in the register, it's been waiting for a long cycle - the longest cycle 35 months, and we're in a month cycle is still continuing and 74.
It looks like a little bit of interest and increase commercially unexpected been destabilized and order equity steady income.
When you change the course of policy difference in effect, the Fed is more quickly than in bonds to shares.
The first increase cycle when the benefits of bonds now doesn't change direction / fall.
The benefits of bonds falling, and increase the interest and at the end of the moment, "Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategy increases in interest, according to experts, the longer and more short-term bonds by getting him close to the benefits of between going to flatten the slope.
In the analysis we high return bonds usually perform better in an environment like this, who said that Schwab analysts, Kathy Jones, but "still don't get to bring about we're careful," he said.
Interestingly, markets think the Fed's policy expectations from now to Jones.
"The dollar strength and inflation expectations the slump in addition to the market are arranged according to various signals that have tighter monetary policy," he wrote, ".
Short-term interest rates are rising, effiiciency lemniscate properly fed politikayı tighten arttı fluctuation, credit outbreaks expanded and all the qualities to be seen in the market.
In the United States, most of their business in terms of large companies that are going to be more attractive interest rates from local products, and they're going to win.
The multinational companies will be a lot of money, because it's worse in the rising dollar debts become more expensive in the global market products and will be more expensive.
Goldman Sachs analysts customers they have planned for in a report, "history'kaliteli" stocks at the beginning of an increase like that shows you can live performance issues, "he said.
The companies have strong balance sheet 1999, 2004 and 1994 followed by an average of 5 per cent of what happened there weak bilançolu increases they were late.
High and low capital return texture to the company that owns stocks are low quality rivals ( percent), they went with a whopping four to ( percent) 3.
Debt will become a big deal.
Goldman, according to the high levels of debt, the company to see the most damage with the candidate.
Except for the game in the stock market, consumers will benefit from $ growing domestic envisioned.
Experts have different opinions about going to keep as much as how fast the tasarrufç high gains, even if they are making out like bandits.

Of course, David Cameron knows better than that of the Lorax?
Every parent's short on time is something learned that: Your child is a book, Love you all knew it wouldn't take much time in almost by heart, you know.
It seems that if you're not David Cameron.
For a child by a holiday favourite deprogrammer supplier for the children's book when asked what happened, Dr. Seuss's 1971 environmental fable The Lorax, the prime minister chose coaster.
The company's Web site, published in the message that says it was a difficult decision that supercamps Cameron it goes like this: "Funny, charming, creative and a strong message that's what the book, in content always we missed, or a vision of the message, my kids, I love reading."
So far, so everything was going really well, until Cameron's supposed to be something about the contents of the book, but I actually wrote the text of the story to inflate the contents of the original 2012 film version of the details of the book and added new character in paragraph compress much.
You don't have to all of nature that even the weather, it's Walled City was a boy named Ted in the thneed ville Meta, a dream for him to win the heart of his daughter Audrey a real tree, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel says it wants to carry out wanting to see, who died in 1991, which is the story of Dr. Seuss tale involving a love don't know.
If you suspect that if he's not enough, Cameron's handling the Internet movie in the archives in a text too many parallels with the Lora filminin short summary, which begins: "Everything is artificial and even the weather a commodity that it's walled city the thneed ville a.m., named Ted wants to win the girl of a child, Audrey's heart."
Judging by the claims made by a competent to be a parent of a young boy in the book, isimsiz Cameron's local environment, the scrub, with a moustache and gave the name The Lorax named "speaking on behalf of the trees" greedy, cutting down trees, despite objections from the creature, was destroyed by the main subject of how the Once-ler AGIS ruins book has no idea what we have heard much less likely.

Lyta man clearly out of England are at risk, but was still intact
The United Arab Emirates to play with a tough task, but at the British team selected to tour Pakistan after seeing the recent Test series 3-0 last time I think there's no in the cards to defeat of a again.
It's still a road trip and I'm not leaving unlikely victory.
Alastair Cook's team more than the last three years and have players who may be inexperienced in the batter's box, but good sense of collective game strong. These are just doesn't heal the wounds of 2012, from youth provides optimism.

Lyta's decision to bring out the man in Yorkshire for me, as head coach of analysing a hard decision.
Seven try against the attack in difficult conditions and simple, but inevitable truth is that it was two good cricketers conclusion they judged on.
For example, Joe Root, there was no sign of any issue with the announcement was forced to be done because - as I said before - the players he was the best choices.
But after a few fifty points of his career series lyta could see that he was appointed his own destiny.
More work, I expect to catch another opportunity for Yorkshire.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss, praised the player's attitude that it doesn't surprise me, even though it's never shown the best performance First of all, it's a team man.
It's hard to answer the question, how long it takes to get a try the strike note.
Lyta - before that, like Sam Robson, Nick Compton - seven cap on the other hand, got nine took it.
Compton rematch game just got lucky.
The only sancısı Jonathan Trott for England's first to go to the Caribbean you can feel lyta's form could be at its peak - but this wasted opportunity - it's in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and for me, a high level clutchhitter.
X-Factor quality, and this one, this is a cricketer in the field at the beginning of the season, Trent Bridge, when you score, we've seen in Yorkshire, 236 against us.
At least for the same opportunity that should underpin this of course, but they were before the United Arab Emirates team up to the formation.
Moeen's, while holding four quick extra game will help him get Cook's opening drive of the way to do with the idea worked and I am not against it.
I don't understand why he couldn't do a shooter got a shot here, and it's already showed how good he is the left fielder as a cricketer.

Every time they want to be a coach for the world, whether you're a player international cricket I've always felt like he was born and have a sense of something that mAh guide.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room before the team can bring something new, even the message said to be true.

By 2017, the economy can make Brexit camp will be slow
David Cameron's negotiating strategy to keep Britain a half-baked again in the EU is getting worse every day, and this situation Jeremy "yes or no?" Corp's Labour's leadership election about Europe on Tuesday over the edge of the TUC, or even though her like that.
In the Corp and Nigel Farages of strangers got their.
Recently a European diplomat buddy of mine, some member states, most of all kinds of crises in the EU, it didn't cause that they were the West, Britain's only because they don't want to think about yourself and work from the agenda, disruptive iiberties divisive treaty changes, they said.

Prime Minister and Chancellor, foreign countries summits in the capitals of the famous monument in front of the bilateral meetings in the area or join the elite, and then they go back to countries taking pictures of himself or not, they say they're acquiring allies for reform.
This is all about me.
Berlin "don't leave us alone with France" about an extrovert who wants Britain to the EU while some European friends in a tent in capitals more and more shortsighted and now they don't mind us not to be a point where ministers and officials said.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and cautious in their right mind, however, an ally, has been in power for 10 years and Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand and Kohl (16) (14) as the worsening situation in samples from the government wants to leave.

The United the Kingdom of Scotland's energy to prevent him to leave you to work on any of these countries for the britannian sew-fee should use it's not really a possibility because they don't have it because it's separatist tendencies.
I mean, it's like some of Scotland in the style of ministers, national party, the United Kingdom's 2017 referendum won't help in this situation by making statements during the campaign was deliberate, they may be planning to speed up the process of Brexit. That's what my friend says.
"The debate was a dead end" and "Britain will benefit from the renegotiate don't have anything."
The previous European experience of how mondo-dizmo oligarchic press Lords of Fleet Street, Tony Benn in time because they know how much EU opposition they weren't like this referendum in 1973, compared to 1975, approving a 1 to 2 check in, they were inspired.

Ed Miliband who enemies of all the lunacy aside, they knew.
Among them are foreigners and big bums, illegal tax karşıt listening in our newspaper there was a residency in out of the so-called owns most of.
In as Tony Blair was the same way about most of these horny, together with a gorilla when he trapped in a cage at lunch and tea time not to be sworn in after him knew it was to distract you by giving a banana.
Miliband, Cameron's shiny, like the idea of a referendum was about to stand up, as Blair, who gave him the way out from Blair Blair in French and Dutch the voters card which was cancelled in 2005 by the EU on the constitution gave the compromise the principle.
He never forgave him in the press about it.

To me that his father to his friends in the cabinet in the '70s TV workers in its battle on infidelity, far enough in the cabinet don't go lose and it reminds me of doing the work.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But "Benn's words -" In any case "to stay in the fight, what McDonnell said nor JC's special meeting on Monday night in the Lords said MPs it was the same thing.
In touching me, considering that Corp's image in the age of TV, clingy the details in general trying to convey, no matter what, and in particular, the social media bed 24/7 paranoia and betrayal in the vortex continues to protect the importance of message discipline.
McDonnell said Labour's in the referendum, like Cameron's support, to be difficult about Europe, which enable it to guarantee is perfectly reasonable.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corp's anti-capitalist and consistent with their past me kuşatma economy about EU membership is now just gloss on doctrinal narcissism brawl little difference between left wing opponents of the building blocks that are not a discussion.
In about Nato as well as in won't do or not - Tom Watson, JC's campaign to leave stable - one of these countries for foreign diplomats in the Lords to mean they'll have to do.
While there's skeptical voters that they will be able to get out of it all go to waste in Paris or Berlin, why them lose political capital about concessions to Britain?
British influence in the opening of the forum on Monday, as they say to me, the US security, the ruling Conservative party in Syria, Iraq, Libya and the British government cost-cutting despite weak due to hear very disappointing performance in the minimum wage.
Public Health England e-cigarette research, experts have criticised him
Researchers, funded by the government agency, made a connection with what happened at a meeting of 12 tobacco industry E cigarettes 95% less than smoking, claims it is harmful, they said.
Experts at Public Health England ( the UN), who wrote the britannian medical magazine's ( PHE) report on e-cigarette use in The Lancet has joined the critics.
PHE, "a detailed review of evidence" described as a "turning point" niteliğindeki report issued last month.
But some researchers questioned the integrity of data and the connections between tobacco industry and some experts noted.
Last month that the Lancet medical journal editorial "extraordinarily rotten foundations" based on PHE's main target.
Two other researchers writing in the the UN claims is "sand or rock was built on a" questioned.
At the London School Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Epidemiology at the European public health Professor Martin McKee, Professor Simon Capewell shuni clinic Liverpool University, said: "The basic principle of public health policies, an indicator of the event it is based."
The public, PHE's "The best available estimate of e-cigarette smoking about 95 percent less harmful" direction of the allegations that a detailed examination of expected based on evidence and modeling, said it would be
This relationship different products containing nicotine, like the opinions about the hurt of a decision to create a synthesis very criteria ( mcda) gathered together to develop a model for analysis of 12 emerges from a meeting. In a research article summarized the results of the meeting.
McKee and Capewell, one of the sponsors, director general, before the meeting for an independent research from British American Tobacco said it was reported that a company called euroswiss health fund.
Also on the West's public health promotion, a sustainability report his certificate approved it, they said.
The meeting one of 12 people had reported that used to fund a e-cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris International, but he got from the tobacco company, reported in funds aren't they added.
I haven't been informed that selected members of the panel how some of them, but these are known in the article reported between industry, including some giants E cigarettes fund.
Some of the other person present at the meeting and they were on tobacco control expertise unknown.
The person responsible, attended the meeting tobacco at PHE.
McKee and Capewell, group research article, written by "effectively" "A lot of criteria too much about the dangers of concrete evidence of the product," she admitted she was a lack of summer.
But PHE report being discussed in any of these contacts or restrictions.
McKee and Capewell, "E cigarettes kids or not smoking, for those who have a cigarette in a transition to having no proof" of allegations that said it was too early.
Prof Kevin Fenton, health and well-being at PHE the director of the the UN said it was given the allegations from before the answer.
He said. "E cigarettes significantly less harmful than smoking."
Lifetime smockers one of the two people dying from this addiction.
All the evidence suggests small E cigarettes compared to the health risks caused by the effects of long-term equitable, but we have to keep digging.
PHE's have a clear mission: A lot of confusion about the dangers of tobacco, especially compared to the public, at a time of the evidence and informed about things that didn't show.
Almost 80,000 people per annum with a cigarette smoking and dying of a disease connected to the NHS cost to £2 billion a year.

The former Channel 4, said he had to leave the BBC EastEnders chief
The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson said he had to leave the broadcast of BBC's EastEnders and The Voice and commercial programs like his rivals for the hit show like Albert Square shows "that they would be able to give their right arm," he said.

In December because of the voice for the future broadcasting primetime - they want to support a wide as possible I
The main idea based on the idea that no one else won't release how I am here, which is ridiculous and frankly ridiculous.
Johnson said: "Without any help fonlanabilecek programmes I don't understand why the tax and funding a mandatory decrescent.
The voice in EastEnders and one another and in fact being held inside the company.
To be honest, that would give their right arm for the other channels.
I'm trying to see how it is of public service.
The BBC that at all, I don't think "M gon" take.
From 2004 until 2010 a series of the entrepreneur who runs the Channel 4, Johnson, "the people who work here passion and these employees this approach long-term support to see as the best way to guarantee" for some accused the BBC about chasing ratings.
BBC's most popular programmes like EastEnders, comments on the BBC to offer programs in 2003 MacTaggert lecture in Edinburgh, who used to sell Sky executive Tony Ball's comments before repeating.
Johnson, public service programmes the BBC went to BBC4 viewers couldn't be done and more appropriate measurement, however, are here for the £4 billion in revenue that license fees and taxes on the ground to continue their mission to provide cover who wants to discuss piety, and he added: "We don't watch, of course, we're doing all this silik programs."
No one's time they put the vacuoles will not watch them.
The committee about license fees, Johnson said. "All you guys, this is the best benefits in terms of the one who got to find a system I invite more regressive.
Of course you think we're all thinking, we're all a big value of £150, £150 a year for the people she's a lot of money, but the reason I wonder if they can do that too many BBC I watch.
The committee, to give evidence in the same day the first time Tuesday, the BBC, Sky and Channel 5 executive David Hand "don't inform, educate and entertain," he said he had to revise the Reithian mission.
A little of the BBC's TV exit - and that this is now officially 1 percent are classified as education and public service in Canada and Australia said it was 0.1 percent of the radio - and it should be leading publications, and that "information, lighting and training" should be replaced as he said.
The BBC about partnerships, hand, only a handful of gösterilen prom on TV and to do something about the online ads for their cooperation with publishers, said that he needed to make sure all eyes on that.

Plastic arts, or something to take care of his acting aside for music, "just the music" is not fair.

What I can catch up with him as a horse of glam rock or punk's cousin.
So if I remember that avant-garde electronic movements more since childhood, in what will be kept as a love jazz?
David Bowie "icon with the phrase" kept telling him what the word means as much as to say that chewing gum.
It wasn't a man, woman and it was not "Human" wasn't.
It was a body.
A US mission was due to appear for a while.
That body. 26 "th studio album" blackster "two days after the matter has been out of the world.
Prior to the publication of the album we listened to "blackster" and "US tried to get used to go with Lazarus.
We "is old, you know, talking about death or something" we were thinking, that you knew everything.
One more game.
The album's message and the burden of feeling great "blackster" and "Lazarus" that piggybacks published a long time ago, but again, except for this album was recorded organized "Sue ( Or In A Season Of Crime)," "Tis a pity she was a whore" with the number of songs we know we can call the album four was generating.
The rest of us. I mean, "girl loves me", "I can't give everything away" and "Dollar Days" get down and I like to say that they are very good songs.
When we look at all, but it's based on a very powerful musical structure to be made of earnest, instant feelings "blackster."
Neither death nor a "dealing with the past" album.
Only a real "final" album.
The bird with a masterpiece "The end" of his life writing music.

Half-term semester how must be assessed?
Tatilini semesterjust students how to assess it? We asked the question to educational expert student coach Murat intellectuals.
Winter break, only for students. Don't rest, don't, don't spend time in as the TV and computers and unthinkable.
It's spring break. New training period and to prepare for a very important opportunity to review past period.
Half-term called free time at the same time, knowledge, skills and personality development don't make an important opportunity for a hobby.
Semester evaluation make a list.
Everything you do, you're planning your summer and try to implement.
I'm sure I enjoy it when the time, and it's a very efficient, you're going to spend a semester.
Fellow students who are getting ready for a semester as a priority now cop Lys productive period should be how we talk about it.
Because this is the question that comes to us the most of his friends cop Lys prepared for your exams. "This term, how we have to take it, plenty of question, we need to solve issues we have to do or do we have missing them?"
And to answer them and to write to us with the advice of a productive session sınava hazırlanan friends introductions.
Sınava preparation under normal circumstances, we need to be a process which started from ninth grade, this is more when we're trying to complete the last, within a year. This is the last year for us to spend more time using the more effective, efficient and compels.
A senior at the same time, written in his work with test prep school have to work with.
At least three times as much as completed school grad student sınava ( cop Lys), even if he had experienced as a graduate student in and year to prepare for her to take it again, is of critical importance.
"It" sees in the last chance because most grad student, and family, it has created a great deal of stress and more at this year.
Working class. Students do not enjoy yourself, just because he felt obliged to do, and that's why every time he left to the end, but it's usually work. If it's all for students who regularly haline getiren habit, and what's what has become a mission to do is always a the plan.
In front of us and we now have a winter break, we should make the most of it.
For that we have a plan that will allow us to rule over time, surely there must be good.
Half year study in the holiday:
Everyone should do a proper plan of myself as a priority.
It's been done, what are they what 1.dönem was incomplete. day, week 15 days of time and have to plan.
Besides, this is about which solutions must be in this period and questions should be.
In short, the same time a lot of students with an average of 1-2, and they can test.
The handle missing your subject: Research. Put a 75 per cent of people in one day a week, 66 per cent, 54 per cent in an hour, and shows you've forgotten.
The best and most effective way to do is to eliminate to forget again.
Past issues, especially from students who must weigh a lot of mistakes, they tend to work again.
Identify your subject missing first day, every day and you get them to a place that day and schedule.
This planning and academic and psychologically, you can relax.
While I set about your issues as well as a mistake that you do happen to be careful.
In the fullness of time for this long because you won't be a holiday period.
Key questions in yapıncak:
It is important, too, to solve as many questions as to do it again.
Because once we figure out how much work we did, however, we can see from feedbacks scope question we get through.
Don't forget to put a certain number of solving the problem every day.
Number of questions to resolve your to do on that day, according to studies vary; You've worked with a lot of questions you might not weighted in one day, but we're still at least that's how we learned about the day for us to see if we're gonna have to work as a solution in a certain amount of questions.
Try soaking exams:
Half year to do on holiday in another study practice tests must be to solve.
At least as much as if all things unfinished schooled practice test solutions you can do it.
Let's that. You took care of largely Turkish class. Turkish lessons prepared questions 40 each, you can solve trials.
While he does it work for, and will do it.
If you can in 60 minutes and 40 Turkish question at first we target a few minutes later, if possible, be trying to figure out in less than that.
Holiday and hobbies plan:
Of course it's just doesn't mean to study. A few day's rest and you have to take a holiday, for your hobbies.
Just a holiday season will be studying to be let off steam and prevents you to rest.
That's why you'll isolate yourself in your plans, they should be in private time.
All the way to read books, watch television, surfing the net in what could be in our programs, most importantly, how much time for.
I haven't spent a little advice in the first time I have friends who say productive.
If, My first semester didn't go so well, so I couldn't work for you if you say too much and I'm missing this winter break, and a great opportunity.
But as a priority and we decide that you must believe.
Turkey and the 2009-2010 season in Super League football the most goals in the 90th minute 76 was thrown out.
Now you answer your question, the game ended, and you yourself do you go to the locker room, or this game is ongoing and we scored, so there's a lot of minutes?
I think a defeated football team used oyuncularının instructor or a classic comments "now we'll look to the games in front of us to say" No one wants to.
The only thing you're going to do now to look at in front of you not to walk past, and should be running.
If we make up what we're saying:
1) plan, a winter break, as a priority
2) You know do it again, through the issues
3) missing, you take care of your subject,
4) Do reconfirm about solving problems,
5) try untape exams,
read the book, 6)
7) again, set new goals for the period
Take your time, things you enjoy yourself, your hobby and 8)
9) your family and spend time with your friends,
10) take time for social and cultural activities ( movies, sports, theatre, concert, picnics, etc.)

Diabetes in obese patients with mild weight loss surgery can help
Type 2 diabetes in obese patients a new study found that moderate obesity surgery at the bottom to see how it would take five years.
However the morbidly obese patients with obesity and diabetes surgery is surgery, more than any seen in patients if they're living long too early to say.
New study conducted on who has written an article in JAMA Surgery, and an expert on obesity surgery, according to Dr. Robin Blackstone "death rates to manifest itself takes a long time."
Weight loss surgeries, aka bariatrik use various methods to reduce the diameter of gastrointestinal surgery.
These limits its ability to reduce hunger and food of the body's digestive tract.
In recent years, research has proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes bariatrik surgery, but a lot of body mass index ( v) 35 or above advanced on the obese person who was made.
BMI is 18.5 to 24.9 measurement by weight out of proportion, and is considered normal.
BMI of 25 or above means you're overweight, obese 30 over BMI, what happens is, they are.
The link, you can count on the BMI 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
The study again, type 2 diabetes min Sheng hospital, full of Taiwan since 2007 the medium-velocity obese patients - gastric bypass surgery in the treatment of two kinds of bariatrik pit-coal meet stomach surgeries and tube - derived from the experiment used the data.
The research from the end of the year the average BMI of 31 for the patients to 24.5 declined.
However, the BMI of those who take diabetes treatment has remained stable in non-surgical 29 neighborhood.
What happened in 36 %28% of diabetes, surgery and is partly solved.
Roads in the group of medical treatment at only 1 percent at 2 percent completely and diabetes compared to this only partly solved.
Writers and triglycerides and it "bad" cholesterol, pointed out that blood pressure control, "surgical intervention in the group saw" generally was better.
Researchers at the same time, reflecting the rate of blood sugar levels in patients in time it has view hemoglobin A1c blood.
According to researchers A1C hemoglobin be kept under 7% of the best.
After surgery from from 9 percent hemoglobin A1C average was down to about 6 per cent.
In the group has remained stable at around 8 per cent of the medical treatment.
Improving hemoglobin A1c level with better "glycemic control," but that investigation, according to Dr. Chih Cheng Hsu and his team in five years to your friends that the rate of mortality drop.
The findings in the research team compared these two hands, with surgery.
In the fifth year with gastric bypass surgery, compared to the group, the group with bypass surgery ( to 18.7 14.2 kg) more weight, BMI at the same way in hemoglobin A1C (5.1 to ones) and (3.1 %2.1% higher diabetes bütünüyle), he was seen decreases setback came out more likely (46.9 to 16.7 percent).
Research at the end of the fifth year in benefits to survive after surgery and a clear indication that medical Phoenix any fun yet? specification Dr. Blackstone, conducted in obese patients more in Sweden from Arizona with a reason to prolong life span of the surgery, according to the study data, he said.
In this study, the Swede, who had surgery in obese patients bariatrik 15 years with a chance of dying compared to the other group was treated for a more traditional was 29 percent lower.
However, this new study from surgery patients didn't show what happened to them to survive even if the relevant benefits, according to BMI of 35 to Blackstone and six people who are in this situation because it's reassuring.
This is in the most crucial part of the article in the group, say, is safe with low BMI, because this surgery, never has there been any increase in the risk of death or renal disorders, he said.
Blackstone, the patient's BMI is 27 and 30 doctors and people don't take issue with the fall under the weight needed to start to take very seriously, he added.
I think we've waited long enough for people to take this matter very seriously, he said.
I think these genetic changes associated with obesity and diabetes in their systems that make their bodies after removing it's really hard to reverse it.

So far in trying to look like celebrities was considered as normal a life started to affect point is seen as a psychological condition, after all.
"Celebrity worship syndrome", aka "celebrity shmoccult syndrome", in the world, and we have already spoken about the new academic subject that has become a new one.
In a hair salon run as normal as a place of famous pictures of ladies.
But all ergenlerin Irish Redhead walk around with hair, the Sultan of'hürrem'senesini record.

Now it's the other way round a wind wreaking havoc around them.
Justin Bieber copy was awash with the lads, the environment.
So much so that we we quote a thousand times on the Internet this useless information read: "First of all Barber gittiğinizde hair their side so your head over the ears and the surrounding area to the top, cut it right."
The side alone will be short.
After the procedure you have to make light of your hair with water.

We are seen as the celebrity fans bundle of love.
The numbers to what degree it affects them sanatçılar fan, he says will stop.
The psychology anyway situation don't see that simple.
According to drink, eat and what to listen to what to wear, particularly teenagers, celebrities decide what is discussed.
Unavailable names don't get offered a role model is described as a mental illness, extreme loyalty.
Psychologist I sümeyra lron, lagging in Turkey's work in this field agrees.
But their families is gradually and that awareness doesn't miss: "Psychological Science, basic issue of comfort in his own identity, to catch a man and be happy with."
Before the children very seriously, someone to fill out completely furnish, posters were excluded.
Now, this is changing.
Parents feel the need to intervene.
"One young man's life with passion and commitment to sign something was wrong."
On the emotional roller coaster fans
Celebrities, as long as not to run away too much attention is safe.
Not wanting to marry her, jealous of his wife, his clothing to be slaughtered like to watch for warning signs suggesting bird iron.
Famous people on earth are we talking about.
A place to be associated with their lives to worry about them, as is normal.
But the majority of them young, dropping the ball in your opinion of expert psychologist: "In the family and around çocuğa virtue, gestures to do in the absence of names in that void filled, surely the point."
Don't they always the best example.
"Child copying in negativity."
We consulted them how to approach in iron, passion, and added more in adolescence I sümeyra celebrity syndrome görüldüğünü Prophethood begins.
Considering the question of what might be insecure adolescents vaccinating more comfortable.
On one hand, while their parents will complain about restrictions on the other hand, we're dealing with young people waiting for support and compassion: "We have to consider their highs theirs."
New research shows that are being made because of changes in their brains.
"Emotional roller coaster rides the young man with a commitment to the natural allowed, soft approach must."
It is possible to change behavior
Psychologist I sümeyra lron, celebrity shmoccult syndrome reminds me of duties to tackle the parent:
To give her emotional distress, before you make sure you're calm.
Don't let never suppress your feelings.
To encourage that you respect his acknowledgment of independence.
Instead of teaching scolding him throw on the names will be good role model, for example, discuss.
Celebrities try to take his place in our daily life together.
The renowned for the real world of books to read together, it's gonna work.
Adult form of adult communicate and transform.
In the brain uses the same roads don't forget your motivation and addiction.
It was a chance to change her share of errors with your child, just accept him.
About fanlıg the expert support will surely get it.
Those who admire and envy and anger
Don't need to turn to the other on the basis of celebrity shmoccult syndrome don't get help and needs.
Intrusive love, a cry for help, actually.
But unfortunately not perceived like that.
This problem and so pervasive that it's not possible to limit a country or continent to.
Dr. RECAI yahyaoğlu in each country to occupy the TV to point out that certain names.
That's more famous syndrome bonding shows: "Them extraordinary."
It doesn't have the facilities of the overall majority of them.
And they're one of the acting like they do not live.
What of mine or lack the courage.
"But it couldn't possibly they way they can't live like anger, and if you have to keep monitorg."
Actually there is no difference who envy or those who follow a rage.
Both admiration for inside.
No-effort them money, they win on the agenda of the tabloids.
It's enough to know that even I fanlıg up for auction.
Psychologist I sümeyra Demir at that point in time to question the reality of those lives a other advice.
When it comes to artificial lives shouldn't be overlooked.
Celebrity duyan passion to support the environment, where this comes in.
But one celebrity fan to admit that it was like in your own troubles.
