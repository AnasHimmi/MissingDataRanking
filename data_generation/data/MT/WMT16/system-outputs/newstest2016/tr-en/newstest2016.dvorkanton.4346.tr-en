Figure 8, Which Shows That Donald Trump Is Serious About The Survey
Labeling it as some iridescent.
Others, such as arguments joke.
And some provide support for internal explosion.
Rep. tried to pull down some of donald trump in the polls, but this (yet) hasn't worked.
The most recent national survey of donald trump as it leads the 11th double-digit shown in the figures, and some are beginning to ask his chances to become the emperor's nominee estate seriously.
Of course, it is too early in the election cycle.
None of them trump the republican candidate could win the race.
Rick perry herman cain's rise in 2011 of experts is due to rise at this time have been saying that for both even in a single county, did not win the bid process.
There are many reasons and shortages that will in the general election.
Jeb bush's but its super pac group, and economic conservative groups like the club for growth outside the trump group's permanent force, and they are aware of in order to spend their dollars are starting to fall.
The emperor is coming here only temporarily survey results, which show that some real estate recently are:
Trump's choice rates changed 180 degrees.
Donald trump just prior to declaring his candidacy in mid-June a survey was conducted at monmouth university that positively two of the emperor rep. real estate for 10 shows.
'tƒ± 40 per cent in the middle of the month of July.
At the beginning of August, 52% 'ydi.
Six of the 10 republicans now positive opinion about donald trump.
Roughly three out of 10'u within the negative.
In the early stages and the number remains high.
Last week, Iowa, quinnipiac poll shows that 60 per cent of republicans prefer a'inin donald trump.
GOP voters two-thirds of the nomination may be satisfied with trump.
Last week, a CNN/ORC survey, 67 per cent of republicans'si Trump a candidate if they are "euphoric" or "satisfactory" would be.
Only the two candidates out of 10 people if that happens, "they felt" they said.
Trump is just euphoric at the same level as carson per cent (43 "screaming" who said they would be Trump for this ratio 40%).
Euphoria close to other people?
Only 21 per cent with Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47% of republican voters'si the institution's runner Jeb bush, the candidate is "not satisfied" or, "they felt," she says.
The majority of the republicans trump the temperament is not seen as a problem.
Donald trump, the show's language and due to the humiliation Monday criticised the abc news/ washington post polls, according to republicans who asked the question 52% of'si estate has the right temperament to become the head of the emperor.
This is where the country's first party will be held by kurultay Iowa, to apply last week's quinnipac here, according to republicans 52% of the'si to establish itself as having personality.
Still 44% of his own, which he believes will serve as an event does not have personality, and ABC/according to the post, the independent does not fit into the white house six in 10 of his temperament't.
Republican voters are beginning to get used to the idea.
Political expert wear their hats when they think that trump is serious about republican voters.
Last week, a CNN/ORC according to the poll who is the best candidate to win the gop nomination when trump was asked four of every 10 people said it was the best.
Four of 10 people money when they put Jeb Bush is a change since the end of July.
The full revelation: in the past, many of the crystal globe GOP voters was not clear.
At the time, in recent election cycles, Republicans think rick perry will be the nominee among four of the 10 people, in contrast, only 28 per cent'i in the end, the selected candidate, mitt romney.
The majority of voters still trump the electoral campaign for the GOP to find plausible.
Republicans even if they were gathered around another candidate, Trump still has almost everyone.
Some experts, the area, which is scattered, pointed out that trump's dominance can contribute to, and in support of anti Trump more than a dozen candidates, it is a fact that split.
However, at the beginning of September, Monmouth University poll, Trump, and many Republicans, including the top of a possible spouse of a candidate, trump has received shows that the majority at any time.
Carla-Fiorina 13 points, Marco rubio, 14 points 15 points walker, Jeb Bush with 19 points and paul rands, John Kasich and chris christie with a score of each of 33.
Tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
Carson to have a possible lead with 19 points in his business.
Donald trump the vast majority of supporters say they made their decision.
Released on Tuesday a new CBS/NYT poll, more than half of the voters who supported trump said they were locked in their votes.
Clearly, a lot could happen to change that, and no one really can say will change their minds.
46 they left open the door for the candidate to change.
Still trump's biggest rival, carson brain surgeon, but two times is closer among voters who said they made their decision to vote for trump.
Six of 10 republicans-immigration agrees with trump on the issue.
Two months ago, the declaration of the immigrants who arrived from mexico in his speech the campaign donald trump, "the rapist" since chat at the beginning of 2016, and the immigration issue.
Some voters away from the republican party hispanik much important trump to speak, and re-branding efforts will potentially damage.
On Monday, however, the new ABC/post poll finds, six in 10 republicans trump agrees with dealing with immigration issues.
The immigration issue on the agenda, so stay as long as Trump will also be on the agenda.
Fury over the government climbed to new high.
Carson and donald trump, largely because of the situation from the outside, roughly half of the republican vote.
On Monday, the new ABC/post poll, six of every ten republicans, government experience to someone who they want someone from the outside.
And in washington, they are angry.

Thanasi Kokkinakis, tennis australia president Steve Healy is supported by
Deserves more praise than criticism for thanasi kokkinakis behaviour.
Tennis australia chief Steve healy, according to teammate Nick Kyrgios Thanasi Kokkinakis, which accidentally damaged by the last break in the storm, and deserves more praise than criticism.
In normal "special K" who is referred to as the younger members of the talented duo Kokkinakis, kyrgios stan wawrinka at the montreal masters who do not welcome him because the ingredients shameful spot light, at the bottom of.
In the qualifiers, which were played in the afternoon in cincinnati difficult, and Kokkinakis his opponent, ryan Harrison, two-time cart while harrison separated by the refs as he "Wawrinka, on top of the kids that came by kyrgios I must go."
Most recent at the us open, richard gasquet in a way that discourages if you dampen the potential of Kokkinakis, a staunch advocate of the healy.

Lost the way and when player is closed in the united states when he broke, but he is not the first player to break in because he heard the disappointment, and I know Thanasi, sufficiently should not be proud of it is different.
However, actually in the united states, Harrison and others with provakatif an environment, to handle itself quite well, and I think it deserves a praise.
The environment in a great team, a wonderful family, and I think more outgoing.
19 years old but very mature, and their team is working hard adjusting to, does not have any problems with other players, and is greeted with respect in the locker room, the training is difficult, very balanced and mature in their own yardstick to me is a teenager and deserve a trial.
Healy also an important draw for kyrgios pleasant views to the decision that; starting on Friday of what is right for all "to take a mutual decision," but as a long-term fixture on the team for out canberra, - support to explain that.
Healy said, "first of all, team [Kyrgios] not strictly about the game we want to focus on the conflict," he said.
And, in my opinion, Nick, federer and Murray, as expressed by people like the children very quickly moved in front of the public's eyes are growing and some horrible mistakes he made, and he deserves all the criticism he received, but we are trying to support, we try to help understand the consequences of their actions, and sometimes is not in the public spotlight, in my opinion, it was the team and the depth that it is best for him.

The 2016 elections: hillary clinton's Bernie Sanders, a national vote has halved the rule of
Secretary of state hillary clinton in the race for the candidacy of former democratic national double-digit lead is, but Sen. Bernie Sanders catch him.
Currently Demoktarik Clinton 47% of the vote'sini (%'den fell 58) Sanders while 27% (%'den 17) and the second position.
Yet announced whether he was in the presidential race, vice president joe biden, the democratic vote of 15% 'ini.
More than five months before the start of the main race, many voters to support democratic candidates said it was too early to make a decision on which.
But clinton's supporters of the other candidates have solid ideas about their own elections rather than more.
Last month, however, cbs news, Clinton a series of demographic group, are losing ground, on the other hand, some achievements by sanders.
Clinton leads among women by a large margin and moderate, but this gap is closing.
Due largely to the support of between the men fell, and only 5 points, followed by sanders godinska self.
Clinton's advantage evaporated democratic voters under the age of 50, and that Sanders now in an unequal position.
However, older voters clinton is leading by a large margin to the right.
Last month, the liberal clinton two-digit digits in front of a moving sander, Sanders but now 5 points ahead in this group.
Nearly half of democratic voters to be the party's candidate at the national level, if they would back clinton passionately.
In some circumstances a quarter, while another 15 per cent are the candidates would support it only if'lik.
Clinton does not support a part of six per cent.
Perhaps not in a way which is hardly surprising, especially with the clinton's current passion of supporters tend to support him.
If clinton is supported at the moment between the views of more complicated - merely behind him with a passion for the quarter.
The democrats said they would support clinton with a passion'i less that 48 per cent of the republican front-runners are talking about donald trump as a candidate, per cent (35).
Clinton's nominee for clinton's supporters about what they want to be open-ended questions are asked, the answers in the right place the first experience (16), now a woman, a time is the idea that a president of the electorate, (13 per cent) and is the best candidate for the job (10).
Clinton's supporters also expressed his relationship with bill clinton (9%).
Compromise on the issues and to be elected, eligibility criteria.
Potential for the presidency as a vice-president, democratic voters in the race to be 57 per cent of'si't want to see, but the third part he doesn't think this way.
Races, the second is the election candidate for the party to voters when asked what Biden at the top.
More than half of clinton's supporters sander, according to biden's deficit could be between a second vote margin.
Biden democratic enter the race for the candidacy unless hillary clinton Sanders, the rise of the rule; Biden in a race with 20 points, level-up to 30 points in a race that is not biden.
Fifty-five per cent of the voters of the democratic clinton is seen as the candidate who is best for a chance to win the general election; however, this was reduced to 78 per cent last month that number'den.
This despite the fact that biden is back from the opening of a second volatility, but selected it can be seen as the percentage of the candidates has increased.
When asked what is the most important thing in a candidate, Democratic voters to be elected in the way of keeping on sustainability.
In a manner similar to last month, never a democrat voter, the candidate or the candidate the candidate for this primary voters as the candidate does not seem unacceptable.
Democratic primary candidates on their party's own candidates or candidates performing well the main characteristic of some voters.
Mostly Clinton, Biden, Sanders, and honest and trustworthy, people with strong leadership qualities.
Biden's honesty in the top three for the lead on Clinton is strong.
Thirty per cent of democratic voters, according to Clinton is honest and dependable, but half of Sanders (15%) for the same, while 27 per cent'nin an opinion on this.
Democratic voters also in general, Clinton, Biden, Sanders, and in line with his own ideology.
Measure all democratic voters have no idea about a quarter of the sanders.
The duties of the ministry of foreign affairs during the course of personal e-mail address and server as many questions relating to the use of Democratic voters on the issue did not affect their opinions about it and are satisfied to a statement.
But the american general public a different story.
Half of americans now are not happy with the statements't only one-third satisfactory.
The public in march of view on this issue, looking at the problems when taken soon after divided.
Most Americans e-mail bickering about their views do not affect the general clinton says, according to the ideas'ya on the other hand, 36 per cent negative.
These Republicans in general, and more than six in 10 people has been distorted their views on the clinton say.
Clinton, however, has been seen as honest and trustworthy by his own party's voters, while that between registered voters generally still a problem: only 32% of it'si honest and trustworthy, while the figure eight points from last month, down 15 points since may.
Per cent of eligible voters sixty-two trustworthy honest and can't find her.
At the same time, 55 per cent of all registered voters in the country do not find'i trump honest and trustworthy.
At the same time clinton and Trump a good score on leadership.
Test the six candidates who participated in Biden, bush, and Carson got the best scores on the topic of honesty.
More frank sanders most of the time, but carson is like, most do not have an idea about it.
The margin of error 351 Democratic voters in the samples from 6%.
Carson national poll, donald trump is behind
Most recent cbs news/new york times poll that donald trump is running close behind Carson
A new poll of voters, the two candidates nearly half of the game it is reciprocity, and shows that there is little chance of other candidates

When fed increases interest rates, what will happen?
With the rise of interest rates, bond bull market tepetaklak revenues climb as the economy, as recorded decline.
We know this.
What we do not know how much of all this in what will continue.
History, particularly in the economy, very little information about the timing.
Decline, the interest rate, plus was dropped by shortly after 11 months, it has been said that 86 in so long.
Us central bank raising interest rates as the fed's aggressive, persistent, if not decisive but often the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Officials of the central bank of the united states of investors ' interest to increase the time to come, but also to emphasize very strongly that the focus should be on how long the process will take normalizasyon, that percentage.
It is a fact that there are various variables.
Finally, however, the rate increase of bustling market participants think it is exaggerated.
Julian jessop of capital economics in a note to clients basekonomisti global, "the global financial crisis the fed's first interest rate increase since some of the 'cheap money' will be interpreted as pointing to the end of the period it is inevitable that," he said.
On the contrary, don't expect us to return to more normal interest rates gradually, but we still are afraid of being seen as a blow where most seismic levels.
Still, the impact will be.
Based on past trends, said in response that some areas of the economy can give:
As in past months on the market, interest rates may be increased for a while balance some things to expect.
At the moment when interest rates increased, the effect is not so dramatic.
After about what the fed will be in a new study, a deutsche bank analyst, said, "first equity yields after the rate increase 12-24 months to see where the trend is to have stalled, so the money may pausing to reflect the policy."
Nuveen asset management analyst Bob Doll, Barron discusses an updated analysis that, according to more recent 35 years in the market, usually steeply rising sales recorded -14 per cent of around 250, a day after moving in a straight line towards the rate increase if there is (on average, an increase of 2.6 per cent) and after 500 days, provided an average yield per cent in the past six 14,4'luk cycle back to normal.
Deutsche shares the impact on interest in the next phase of the business cycle to increase the yield is over more prominent.
To decline, it is a fact of economic life, however, will help them increase their interest.
Fed, the updated, were not present previously, and are immediately confronted with some situations that will accelerate the decline.
The most attention is the gross domestic product for the increase in the fed rate is at the lowest point to date.
Deutsche bank, according to'den since the 1950s, 118 interest rate grew by only 4.5 per cent year-on-year gross domestic product in nominal terms under'in to the year twice.
However, stood at 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, but the atlanta fed, something that very few people expected to be permanent, 'te 1.5 per cent in the third quarter.
According to deutsche, interest rates may be an increased risk in such a fragile economic environment, and "this time will be different" can lead to the question.
The fed's interest rate over a year, which is expected to rise this week to the attention of market participants will close on Thursday, federal Open Market committee meeting.
Many strategy specialists and economists believe an increase in the fomc meeting could be approved, but the only trade a 25% possibility.
"'den since 1950 we have done the studies so far, the whole building cycle within a cycle of the rising trend super gross domestic product, launch, quick access to recovery after the peak before recession," he said.
On the contrary, in this example the worst recession in a time that has a slow recovery.
The current cycle, it is waiting the longest recession since the fed's last cycle -the longest was 35 months records in cycles, and this cycle, 74. in are still under way.
With interest rates expected to rise, fixed income, equity of a modicum of stability and order.
The real difference is that in the course of fed policy in effect when changing faster than stocks of bonds be seen.
The first cycle of rise/fall when bond yields does not change direction immediately.
At the end of the cycle interest rates rise, bond yields fell at the moment," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategy according to experts, the longer and shorter term bonds to yield increases in rates between the curves will be straightened and close.
Our analysis of high-yield bonds usually perform better in such an environment that exhibited Schwab analyst, Reduced Jones, "but we are still careful to achieve a yield," he said.
Interestingly, the expectations of the fed's policy has already adapting jones of the market.
"The decline in the strength of the dollar and inflation expectations, in addition to the various signals of the market that have been held according to tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are rising, efficient curve, the widening of the credit spread, and up to the wave - tighten policy when the fed has all the attributes to be seen on the market.
In broad terms, business the majority of companies in the united states, interest rates have increased their local products that will be more attractive.
Multinational companies who are already in debt of the situation worse because it will be the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market, and the debt will be more expensive.
Goldman sachs analysts in a report prepared for their clients, "the History, 'quality' securities', such an increase may indicate low at the beginning of the performance experience," he said.
Companies that have strong balance sheets, 1994, 1999 and 2004, which have weak balance sheets and that the following increases in average rate of 5 per cent.
Capital high yield and low tide stock companies that have low-quality of its competitors (per cent) of 4 (per cent) with an average of 3 have passed.
Debt will become a major issue.
Goldman, according to the high rate floating currency that most of the companies suffer.
Gross stock market with the exception of the game, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar also stipulates that.
However, experts have different opinions on the urgency of, although savers may profit from the high achievements.

Public health experts Uk e-cigarette research are critical
An agency funded by the government, the researchers, the tobacco industry that there are those who are affiliated with a 12-member conference e-cigarette smoke than about 95%, is less harmful.
British Medical Journal (BMJ), who wrote the experts of public health england (PHE) e-cigarettes about the report appeared in the lancet used in critical evidence.
PHE, "the evidence to be examined in detail," a "crossroads" in the nature of a report released last month.
But some researchers questioned the soundness of the data, and some experts and drew attention to the relationships between the tobacco industry.
The lancet medical journal last month's editorial of the main conclusions of phe "based on the exceptionally rotten core" of the target.
Writing in bmj, the researchers claim that the other two "was built on the top of the rock or the sand if" question.

The public Phe "the best available estimates, according to e-cigarettes than to smoke around 95% less harmful" based on a detailed analysis of the evidence of the claim and the modelling is expected to be.
In fact, this varied opinions about nikotin products that includes losses related to multiple criteria decision analysis, in order to form a synthesis (mc) model to develop, removed from a meeting of 12 people who gather together; the results of the meeting boil in a research article.

The meeting also involved the persons responsible phe tobacco.
Capewell McKee and the article by the research group "effectively" "according to several criteria, most concrete evidence of harm of the product," writing that he accepts that there is a lack.
However, none of these links or the restrictions PHE is not discussed in the report.
Capewell and MCKee, "e-smokers or for people who don't smoke children second hand smoke, should be a transitional any evidence that is" too early on the claims.
Phe health and welfare direktorui Prof Kevin Fenton, responded to the bmj's claims.
"E-significantly less harmful than smoking cigarettes."
A lifetime smoker, one of two people dying due to this addiction.
All evidence the e-cigarettes is small compared with the health risks pointed out that the cause of that, but long-term we must continue to study the effects.
Phe has a duty clear: public confusion when the tobacco is comparative with bilhassa much about their losses at a time when to get information about what is doing and where the evidence showed.
Nearly 80.000 people die annually from a disease associated with smoking, and smoking 2 billion per year nhs ¬£'the cost of e.

According to research by consulting firm wood mackenzie, low oil prices oil and gas exploration/production in 380 billion dollars due to the suspension of the project, while africa from the gulf of mexico, in a wide geography of millions of barrels of production was postponed.
The biggest reason for cost cuts, in the summer of 2014 115 to $ 1.5 years in the 70% losing value, which shows that the price of oil has fallen to its lowest level in 12 years, "the report the company was a dramatic contraction of their budget," the report said.
$ 400 BILLION ON HOLD
When every day held new surprises crude oil prices, finally, saw its lowest level in the past 12 years, $ 30 below.
"Oil $ 15m will"; "the longer oil is cheaper than water if" energy consulting firm Wood mackenzie research by the flames of the debate now, how that affect the industry for a reduced price.
Finally, in a report released in July plunging oil prices of $ 200 billion due to the suspension of the 46 major energy investment, showed that Wood Mackenzie, yilsonu new research by 2015, this figure which it open up.
This, according to 2015'in in the past six months, the biggest project 22 is further delayed, as the collapse in oil since the start of 2014, 68 in all major projects have been put on hold.
400 billion is the value of these projects is$.
2.9 MILLION BARRELS DAILY
The impact of low oil prices of the company's plan "the cruelest" stresses the research, most of the projects that affected their development project deep sea is being made.
A total of 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent reciprocity of the projects suspended vigorously, 2.9 million barrels daily oil production by 2025'e so it was postponed.
The research, according to final investment decisions and most of the projects were postponed until after 2017, and 2020 or 2023 register time target for first production.
68 delayed the project, including the next 5 years 170 billion dollars including a potential investment, the report, "the majority of the $ 170 billion deep-sea projects."
For this reason, the preliminary investment costs are too high.
"Deep sea 70 per cent of expenditure"ini said, particularly nigeria, angola and the united states of oil in the gulf of mexico projects," he said.

IRANIAN EYES
Not much four years ago, a picture: the united states and europe imposed an embargo on iranian oil tehran to stop its nuclear programme, the price of a barrel of oil about 110$, and iran's oil exports due to a sharp jump in the cost of discussion will be cut and how.
When we returned to this week, we see a different scenario altogether.
Oil prices for the first time since 2004'ten less than 30 $ and the main reason manufacturing was booming in the united states that has seen the removal of the embargo on iran.
For that reason, eyes on iran.
Iran's oil exports if it decides to increase its already quite doygun oil would be poured even more fuel on the market.
The prices below that level may be prompted to download also surprise us today.
Some analysts who want to capture market share much further saudi arabia oil pump on iran would be a war between iran and arabia and s. price.
Sanctions lifted off as soon as iran's primary goal of its fast-growing india and asia as in europe, its former partner on the oil market is being made.
In earlier statements by iranian officials, and 500,000 barrels a day to boost exports in the first phase after a period, so the amount of said they were aiming to hit the market again.
On the map according to reuters, Iran off 22-very large crude oil carriers (VLCC) are expected, but at least 13"performs or completely contains a large amount.
Iran, the world's fourth largest proven oil reserves.
Thanks exceptions to sanctions, Iran is still about 1 million barrels of crude oil in some of the countries turkey exports the reality.
Before the sanctions, iran's oil exports day-up to 3 million barrels a day.
Backed securities, research a specialist, a restraining sky player, oil $ 20 whether it answered the question down below says: "china-based global growth concerns the downward pressure on commodity prices increase in oil prices have contributed to the depth of the losses."
As the world's largest oil importer in china, in line with the economic slowdown, with concerns that will reduce oil demand, oil'ye 20 per cent of the losses since the beginning of the year.
In addition, the dollar value of the global supply and global impact of the problems with the oil more than $ 30 below in the coming days we can bear witness to fiyatla.
32-33 $ fiyatla on the level unless we see the upward and the downward movement may be limited in permanent oil could increase pressure.
At this point the critical $ 30m a key role in the closings continue to see drops below the level that it can be.
In such a case the lower side 23.30-25.60 support should not be a surprise to see them relax which lasted until the area.

How the semester should be semester break?
How should students semester break? the education specialist-ram murat aydin asked to student.
The students not only for the semester break; to relax, to entertain, to spend time at the beginning of the television and computer and should not be considered.
The holidays semester; new review for the period from the past and prepare for the training period is a very important opportunity.
Free time so-called semester, the break at the same time, personality development, knowledge, skills and is an important opportunity for the hobby to learn.
The list of the evaluation of the semester.
What you will do whatever you have planned for the summer, and please try to practice.
Sure to enjoy a fruitful and very godo olunki last semester.
Now, the first YGS-LYS fellow students who made preparations for how the period of a fruitful semester, it should be it.
Ygs and lys exams in the united states, because from a friend who is preparing for one of the biggest questions that is "how we should value this term, and we have ample address the question, or, we have our issues or we should handle them?"
A priority for them both to spend and to answer an efficient period, enter the test with a friend preparing for our advice articles.
Under normal conditions, the process of test preparation for 9th. the class began with starting a process that should be so much more for the past 1 year we're trying to finish; this is the last year for us more effective, efficient, and timely, more accurate, compel us to use.
Student test preparation, in addition to the school at the same time writing their works together to walk.
Graduate students who have completed at least 1 time by any of the school to test (YGS AND LYS) have gone, and though, even though graduate students re-test will be preparing to the time of year when it's also crucial as it is.
Because many graduate students and the parents 'O' is seen as the last chance and this can create a greater stress of years.
Classes to work; a student's taste is not itself just did it because it felt forced, and usually always leave to the latest research, but it; do it regularly, for students who make a habit, this is a task entirely, and what's always a plan when it is within.
Next semester is a holiday, and that we should consider the best way.
For that to happen, a plan that will allow us to run good time on our hands for sure.
Half Year During The Holidays The Lessons Study:
Everyone should make a plan appropriate to his own situation as a priority.
1.when the deal was, what fell short of the day, the week and the 15-day time plan.
Both should be back on this period, but also the problem solving.
At the same time, students also test that the test is not too much of a lack average 1-2 solve.
Heal your missing issues: the Research; learning of their 75 per cent of the people in a week'ini 66%, 'sini a day, an hour'unu forget it shows that 54 per cent.
To forget the best and the most effective way to eliminate, to be done again.
Students who generally make a lot of mistakes of the past should give weight especially to work again.
Your question first and identifying short on the day scheduled for each day and will settle them in place.
This planning, you will be both academic and psychological relief.
Put your plan on, but also please be careful to the issues you have made the most mistakes.
Because at the time, so a long-term period will not be your vacation.
The Structure Of Resolving The Problem:
Again that is very important to do so engaging to resolve the issue.
We do because we understand how works, but we can see from the donut we got through with the problem solved.
Do not forget to put the number of resolving a specific problem each day.
On that day you will solve the problem that the numbers may vary, depending on the work you will do in a day do you work too much weight can not solve problems, but still, at least that day's topic for us to see that we are learning how to work together to solve the problem we will do at a certain rate.
Essay Exams Solve:
The other half holiday during the year that you will do also test the test to solve.
How much of each are not finished all of that, but at least the lessons lesson test the test could be a solution.
We have said; Turkish lessons you have largely settled; Turkish lesson 40 questions you can solve'ar prepared for the test.
And in doing so necessarily, time study.
Turkish in 60 minutes if you can solve the question at first then next 40 if your goal in less time if possible a few minutes can be solved.
Hobby And Vacation Plan:
It is not the only study which is also subject to the holidays; spend your days rest, and you should leave for your hobby.
Just relax and work with you to learn to be a vacation and you are desarj prevent.
Therefore, your plan within a specific time that you will set for yourself.
Reading books, watching tv, surfing the internet on your plan to do in front of the ta could be and, most importantly, what how much time to allocate.
A little advice to my friends who said that I was not the first time will be fruitful.
If; for me, my first time was not very good, I worked hard and if you are more of my shortcomings, this semester vacation is a great opportunity for you.
But you have to decide to believe you and that it is a priority.
Football turkey super league goals in the 2009-10 season in the 76th. and 90. minutes.
Now ask them to give you the answer you questions and you go to the locker room the match has finished, or if the match is still in progress, and you will consistently score more minutes?
I think a football team who lost a mentor or a actor is a classic interpretation, which is used by "now we look to the next game," he said, not wanting anyone to.
The only thing left to do now you will look back to your front, to walk, not to run.
We are saying we will recover:
1) plan a holiday in the first semester structure
2) you know that the above re-structure
3) Complete handle your issues,let
4) consolidated enterprises on the problem solving structure
5) Test solved exams,
6) read the book,
7) set new targets for the new period,
8) yourself in your hobby time for the things you enjoy and leave,let
9) leave your family and friends for your time,let
10) you allocate time for social and cultural activities (cinema, sports, theatre, concerts, trips, picnic, etc.)

"What to do" stage, to talk about the concrete steps instead of "strategy" has tried to put forward.
Overcome all these problems with democracy and stronger, more could be met with justice.
The chp, for the sake of a promise and "bringing democracy we will work regardless of the price."

For years most anticipated in the meeting, the federal reserve, politicians around the tables of spending two days this week maun 27 feet honduras since almost ten years, and has decided not to increase interest rates for the time to come.
Located in a wing of the central bank, the two-floor conference room of the united states the official wall.
The women fed president janet l. map yelle and his colleagues to keep on top of the nation's economic interests and other things.
The central bank has two tasks at the congress: the united states to maximize employment and keep prices stable here.
However, since the fed is not written to the leaders of the great depression he admitted that it was a third replacement: the financial balance.
And the third speaker on Thursday, the us economy since late 2008, which will be announced close to zero short-term interest rate forecast is unique stimulus that comes from cutting off support ready to start on whether it will be the x factor in a close decision.
Data shows that most of the economy is growing in a robust manner, but recent turbulence in global financial markets Fed carefully prepared in the event of officers, reference, fewer than a quarter of a percentage point interest rates federal funds rate even more skittish about adding boost and fragility could make.
"Honestly, when the labor market, and inflation will be followed by the first and the most important thing," the firm stifel nicolaus brokers & co chief economist at B. Lindsey Piegza said.
"But I think if they are an excuse not to increase the ratio between increasing uncertainty surrounding the global market it will serve as sufficient grounds for them to wait a bit more," he said.
No consensus about what the fed will do and that in itself is causing fluctuations in the financial markets.
Economists had expected an increase of interest this week half of the recent bloomberg view.
This, along with the financial markets at the fed, only about 30% 'luk indicates the possibility of an increase to be the main indicators to expect.
In that case, the fed rate increase, a further increase might be in the way of policymakers promised that if it does not mitigate the effects can point to a decline in the stock market.
On Tuesday, the dow jones industrial average index 228,89 points, or 1.4% increase 16.599,85'e.
Moody's capital markets Research Group John Lonski, chief economist "this week the fed's policy of making the rate unchanged was expected to keep the trigger," he said.
"It would be surprising for the fed to raise rates now," he said.
If the fed had taken a decision in this regard executives, "whom he would require to take more years to calm the financial markets panicked."
Other experts on the removal of the fed's move will make its foggy when the curtain might calm the financial markets due to a rate increase.
Only a month ago, this month the fed rates by 0.25% it looked like were to rise; that is, to pick up us on the road to financial conditions slowly narrowing, it would be a small step.
Yelle, the liberals despite their complaints about the necessity of a more economical process, this year's rate increases expected at the beginning of the spring and summer.
The pace of job creation has dropped in August, but growth was flat in the labour market this year.
The unemployment rate last month, the lowest level in seven years, which was 5.1% 'e fell, and the fed is considering moving closer to full employment.
The recovery showed signs of wage increases.
And the central bank's annual inflation of 2% below the target remained, despite the fact that the fed, politicians, the sharp decrease in oil prices is an important cause of the temporary impact.
Pantheon Macro ian shepherdson, chief economist of the economy "can cope with higher rates, even though the market is tight and labor needs that to happen," he said.
But all the world's financial markets at the end of last month, china's currency after devaluation leading to shake.
The dow jones industrial average index, slowing the downward global economic growth for fear of drawing a chinese investors may record 16% of gold has fallen by.
Market, the dow is now almost as high in may, a 10% 'u, in a way, jumped backward.
Fed policymakers turbulent market, further complicating the time to calculate the interest rate will be increased.
Fly with researcher Stephen D. Oliner Ziman Center for real estate and previous fed a senior research associate "in the chinese economy over the past few weeks in the financial markets is known as the best and economic attributes can be a little narrow in the news about a lack of this meeting," he said.
These effects better to run at least now they will wait for another month.
"Much uncertainty over what will be the effects of the us economy, and developments in the history of china to be taken to the belt in their power to connect almost no data don't have" Oliner says.
The fed is not one of the primary concerns of the health of the global economy, so should not be a factor in the process of taking land from a technical standpoint.
But in reality Fed the world's monetary authorities.
The central bank in recent years, the impact was enormous.
Until then, Head only clues s. bernanke, fed'te gene that triggered the financial tremors of global markets by 2013 "reduce."
A world where economies are increasingly intertwined market and the only other place to follow developments in the fed, but also better to read the global economy, managers and other central banks can be expected to consult the experts.
Asset management company, Envestnet Inc.', global chief strategy Zachary Karabell the decision-making process "of a science more than an talent."
Federal reserve bank of Richmond, Va. This month president jeffrey Lacker "the fed seems to be connected with the movements of the financial markets, economic fundamentals, which shows the extreme reaction in the past," he noted.
Policy makers, Federal Open Market Committee and a voting member lacker, who with the right pressure for a rate rise, for example, referring to the 1998-1999 decision.
Lacker said, "the united states can be a definition of the limits to growth recommendations," the fed during the financial crisis in asia, the benchmark rate of the three sessions in has forced to cut a score of 0.75," he said.
A year later, those cuts reversed fed officials.
The bank of england rate to set Adam S. Posen, a member of the previous committee, "the fed, the great recession of 2008 only during the market meltdown of financial stability should have put its worries as it was before," he said.
Are close to this level of recent turbulence.
A rate hike to be afraid to go to the markets because it is disgruntled to have, you really want, he said, the head of the institute for international economics kingston, Posen.
The central bank law still has two powers, and talking about the financial balance, and until that changes I don't think that they should make a move in that direction.

Weight loss surgery can help obese patients with diabetes who are mediocre
Obesity surgery patients according to a new study of type 2 diabetes in obese can take years to see the benefits of secondary or five.
Obesity, diabetes patients who are very obese but in the middle of their surgery, the patients had not had surgery in comparison to say whether it is too early to longer lives they live.
Surgery conducted on the new jama study, article writing, and obesity surgery specialist dr. robin blackstone in, "according to the mortality rates of itself takes a long time to clear."
Bariatrik weight loss surgery with the other surgeries, the smaller will use a variety of methods to reduce the stomach size.
These will limit the ability of the body's hunger and reduce food sindirim.
Within a year, bariatrik surgeon in the treatment of type 2 diabetes has been proven effective but most of the studies that the body mass index (VKI) was conducted on obese people who are over 35 or extremely advanced.
Proportion of weight, which is measured with a clip BMI, 24,9 was 18.5%, it's considered normal.
Of the people 25 or over BMI show that more than 1kg, while those who have more than 30 BMI considered obese.
Now you can account for bmƒ± links: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv said.
The new research, taiwan fully-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital, in the treatment of obese type 2 diabetes patients since 2007'den bariatrik various secondary surgery of the two - vitro experiments where they compare the data obtained from their use and gastrik baypas stomach surgery.
Starting at the end of the fifth year of the study, the average of 24.5 31'e sunk'den bmƒ± of those who have the surgery.
This aggregate, surgical and non-Bmƒ± of those receiving treatment diabetes remained stable at around 29.
Diabetes, those who had surgery 36% fully'sinda % 'inde 28, has been partially solved.
The medical treatment compared to diabetes in the group that only received 1% and'de completely and only 2% partly'de been solved.
In addition, authors, blood pressure control, trigliseridler and "bad" LDL cholesterol, "the group who received surgery" usually better.
The researchers also hemoglobin a1c in blood sugar over time that reflects the rate of the patients blood levels of photographed.
By the researchers, according to hemoglobin a1c 7% of'nin it is best to remain in.
After the surgery, hemoglobin a1c, on average, 9 per cent to 6 per cent'dan about'ya download.
Who receive medical treatment in the group, remained stable at around 8 per cent.
However, those with hemoglobin a1c levels, which the correction better "glisemik control," who conducted the research Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and team mates, according to the positive rate does not decrease within five years.
The research team compared the findings with the surgery in the hands of these two types.
For the fifth year, the group who had stomach surgery vitro, which gives more weight to the group who had baypas relation to surgery (18.7'ye of 14.2 kg), Bmƒ± (at 7.4 5.1'ye), and hemoglobin a1c (%'e 3.1 to 2.1%) and the chances to see bigger drops fell completely of their diabetes is up higher (%, 46.9 percent for shiite 16.7).
At the end of the fifth year of study following surgery although he did not specify a clear survival benefit, arizona college of medicine-Phoenix Dr. Blackstone, sweden, which was conducted in patients with a weight in surgery according to a study that extends the life of the data was valid, he said.
From sweden this study, obese patients who have surgery bariatrik more likely to die in 15 years who received traditional treatment group compared to 29% lower.
However, this new study has shown how the benefits can be for the survival of the patient that surgery, but according to blackstone, the issue is also connected with, and BMI'in for those under 35, this reassuring.
The article is here is low because most of the group lives part bmƒ± this is safe to say that surgery is the risk of death, or see any surge in renal disturbances has been said.
Blackstone, people and 27 doctors when the patient's bmƒ±'un falls below 30, the weight should start to get serious about the issue, he added.
I think people take the issue seriously enough to wait.
In my opinion, these genetic changes associated with obesity and diabetes as part of their body after having collected which made it really difficult to reverse.

Today I watched a man after the murder of due to legal intervention.
I hope not, but if if it is in the oklahoma county jail death in lethal injections at the gallery to watch the room while I'll sit with richard glossip executed.
The official asked me to be one of four sahiti of the death of my self.
The invitation, via his best friend and was shocked at how I first was held in January, even though I have to admit.
That day approaching, I began to fear it.
This is why I do what?
I accepted this one because I think the death penalty is a good way to tell about the whole story.
Will offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to watch the death in america of the current location because it is much more practical than whom, while a terrible lottery will decide the election.
Oklahoma media'den five to 12 of the seats.
If if he is elected who will be watching to indulge in a sense.
I cannot do that.
Glossip's closest friends richard and I sat in the well-being of a visit that lasted two and a half hours last month for phone and as a result of a relationship with him, I developed.
I love that man.
Speech laugh very often.
The prison officials in both a witness and they said I could not become a journalist, why did a pen for my things that I have seen me, and books will be given.
I'll try to remember all the details.
An oklahoma journalist accused of compromising objectivity me on my twitter.

They'll understand that liked the story of him prisoner, gain access.
I complained him.

Richard Glossip, I said, and I write of things with me.
To me, what I will say and write does not do so, I will accept it.
Ask me when I told him he could be removed from the list of sahiti.
But there are also an international correspondent to write them.
Murdered, his movements against the death penalty spreading to the public that will help.
A huffington post reporter, Kim Bellware also on my side.
If you want to know more about it, please listen to the podcast series I have prepared.
I will not understand all the details again here.
Glossip I have no idea that richard is innocent.
Barry Van treese crime after his death is sufficient to make him a partner.
However, I believe that is not guilty of the murder of him.
I believe the legitimacy of the death penalty is certainly not enough evidence to.
I don't think his death is wrong.
With this perspective I will follow his death.
I can't really claim that I will be objective.
For this you can look at the other reporters there.
Will you take me the impression, following the death of an arrogant man, who was killed in an unnecessary way you would get the impression from.
