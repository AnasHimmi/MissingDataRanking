Teacher admits to shooting his girlfriend to an emergency call during
Sound just a little bit of color of the university teacher Shannon Lamb told the emergency during the call to the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his ”golden dog” is alive and probably shocked, and said that the dead woman's next of kin contact details can be found in this phone.
Inside the house police found Amy Prentiss the body and booklet page with the handwritten message: ”I Am so very sorry I wish I could cancel this I love Amy and she is the only woman who has ever loved me,” said the letter, which according to experts is Lamb's signature.
There was nothing to indicate that the Lamb, who taught two online courses to Minnesota, Cleveland, Delta State University, had already traveled nearly 500 miles of the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed like the history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, this office door.
Delta State university chief of police Lynn Buford told the university staff to hear of the shooting at 10.18.
He said Lamb had called a fateful emergency call, for some time after.
The end of the day the number of dead rose one: Lamb committed suicide in a police siege when votes.
Authorities are still trying to figure out Lamb's motive on the day after it, when students and staff must have a school shooting because of hiding behind locked doors.
Researchers state both sides have published their data, according to which the students and staff described the Lamb as a talented teacher, which, however, possibly was the problem.
The students told me he's waited his hour.
Prentiss died on, Gautierin, police said that Lamb had a violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself was included in the Lamb's book she's written, in which he thanked the ”great people” with whom he shared academic life.
Both taught social science and history department, with a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students participated in both the man of the courses.
On the other hand, were visible some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised the Lamb, but to say that he also seemed nervous and agitated, ”as if something had been going wrong”.
Another student Mikel Sykes said Lamb told him that he had a lot of stress in the academic year of 2014-15 at the end.
Lamb had previously requested sick leave from Delta State University saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two courses.
The recent changes to the university hiring policy meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate in the front, it does not taannutkaan her auto career development and assistant professor posts.
University president William LaForge said, that the Lamb's and schmidt's between he knew to be no conflict whatsoever, but that ”clearly the Lamb's mind was something”.
These questions Lamb is no longer able to respond.
After the Lamb had escaped from the campus, the police can get to him, when he moved back to Mississippi Arkansas state.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in a house with a backyard about a mile south of her parents ' house in Mississippi at the greenville suburb, told the Washington county coroner methe in Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb just went to this house, though Johnson said he believes that Lamb felt the people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education science. The university has 3500 students and it is located in the city, which has about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his doctorate degree in educational sciences in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston says she was 15 years old and Lamb 20-year-old, when they met with mutual friends.
Hairston friend who was in high school, and Lamb was nice, older guy, who tried for many years to teach Hairstonin to play the guitar.
He was quite a charmer in those days.
All the girls were to melt the wax, when she was there, telling the now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandonissa.
Lamb and Prentiss were apparently dating for some time.
Emergency calls in the story Lamb told us he killed his wife, but their marriage is not any kind of evidence.
They had Lightning-named dog, who lived with them the river of the brick house in Gautierin.
Police told the dog was fine.
Prentiss, an ex-husband Shawn O’Steen told them I divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends. They now have a 19-year-old daughter.
”He's really upset,” O’Steen described the daughter.
She was the mother of his best friend.
O’Steen told me that I had met a Lamb, but had heard her daughter Abigail, that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss, when Lamb and Abigail were both performing at the summer market three years ago.
Later they played together with someone for the gig.
O’Steen told reporters that her daughter is doing and sing their own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different network company.
Gautierin near the location of the shadow bar The Juleps Room bartender and occasional entertainment fixer Mike Shaffer reported that he saw the Lamb and Prentiss last September 5. night, when the Lamb had finished the guitar and harmonica performances a limited number of audience.
Nothing seemed to be going wrong.
”The only happy couple,” he said.
We were messing around and throwing witticisms at each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first year students in the seminar program and was a specialist in indian and colonial history, tell the school the teaching of English Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and he had three small children.
He studied at Kansas Emporia State University and was a fraternity and student government chairman.
Tuesday night in Cleveland Delta State campus held a candlelight devotional, which was attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part to the exhibition, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The teaching will continue on Wednesday.
”We're trying to get students to return to”, LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is recovery time.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reports the Mississippi from Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus of Mississippi green ville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans participated in the report.
The story has been corrected according to the police, you now say Lamb called the emergency call Schmidt after the shooting, and that although the Lamb was referring to a call during prentiss's wife, there is no evidence that they had been married.

The UN leader said that the Syrian situation is resolved militarily
Secretary-general Ban Ki-moon's response to the fact that Russia increases military support to Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict ”is not solved militarily”, and the additional weapons only exacerbated the violence and the millions of people suffering.

Ban told reporters Wednesday at a press conference that he plans to meet with the five permanent member states - the United states, Russia, China, Britain and France - foreign minister of the general assembly ministerial week in connection with later this month to discuss Syria.

8 support for the survey results that show that Donald Trump is serious about
Some have tried to label him a wind viiriksi.
Others consider him only as a joke.
Part of waiting for the collapse.
Although some republicans have been trying to get Donald Trump off the support queries top position, it is not (yet) successful.
The last 11 national survey in ten Donald Trump has been in the lead with a two-digit century, and some are beginning to seriously reflect on what this means to the real estate of the king's nomination opportunities.
Election season is certainly still in the early stages.
These results do not mean that Trump is likely to be the republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing its leadership position to the rising Herman Cain, neither of which have gained any state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why to him would have trouble in the general election.
Outside groups, like Jeb bush's Super PAC and conservative economic organization the Club for Growth, however, are noted Trump's tenacity and started to use the funds to her kaatamisekseen.
Following the recent support for the survey results suggest that the real estate king, not just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity figures have made a u-turn.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the Monmouth university support for the survey showed that only two republicans out of ten I welcome the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August the figure was 52%.
Currently, six out of ten republican take Donald Trump welcomed.
About three in ten say that they are negative.
These figures also hold the first primary states.
Quinnipiacin made by the university, support in a poll in Iowa last week, 60 percent of republicans told reporters that they are positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of republican voters would be happy if Trump will be the candidate.
CNN/ORC's poll last week, 67% of republicans said that they would be either ”enthusiastic” or ”satisfied”, if the Trump should be the nominee.
Only two out of ten said that they would be ”shocked” if he would become a candidate.
Only Ben Carson can achieve roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent ”enthusiastic” vs. Trump 40%).
The next most enthusiasm for the cause?
Marco Rubio only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of republican voters would be ”dissatisfied” or ”shocked” if the powers that be favorite of Jeb Bush should be the candidate.
Trump's fiery temper is not a problem for the majority of republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been criticized widely for his pompous speeches and insults, Monday's ABC News/Washington Post survey, 52 percent of republican side of the tilt of the electorate at the national level thinks that the real estate king is the president of the appropriate nature of the quality.
Quinnipiacin last week's survey, the first meeting of the party system in the state of Iowa chapter is the same: 52% of republicans think that Trump is the director of the appropriate nature of the quality.
The ABC/Post poll, 44 percent, however, thinks that his character application as president, and nearly six in ten think that his character belongs to the White house.
Republican voters used their idea.
When republican voters think like the commentators, they are of the opinion that Trump is a real option.
CNN/ORC's survey, four out of ten have Trump as the most likely alternative when asked who most likely appointed a republican candidate.
Yet at the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Data announcement: the republican party, the voters do not always have access to the brightest possible crystal ball.
Last election season, this time four in ten republican was of the opinion that Rick Perry is appointed as a candidate, and only 28% in favour of the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of republican party voters should Trump the campaign as credible.
Even if the republicans would settle in the to support another candidate, Trump would win yet almost every.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmentation of the field most likely has contributed to a Trump lead, since Trump's anti-support is divided into numerous other bachelor's.
Monmouth University at the beginning of September, carried out by the survey, however, showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race in the Trump and nearly all other republican candidates for accession between, Trump will receive majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubiota 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb bush by 19 points, as well as Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie, each 33 points.
He is level on points with Ted Cruz.
The only Trump of the winning candidate?
If they should be placed facing each other, Ben Carson would win in a business man Trump high 18 points.
Just the majority of Donald Trump supporters have been told to make his decision.
New CBS/NYT's poll Tuesday showing that only slightly more than half of the Trump voter has decided who their vote will go.
The situation could naturally change, and no one can absolutely for sure say that never would change his mind.
46% reported that they can possibly change bachelor's.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made their decision, are two times more likely to Trump the side.
Six out of ten republicans say that are the Trump agree with immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump two months ago called mexican immigrants ”up to be sex offenders” campaign launch speech, immigration has been at the center of 2016 debate.
Some are worried that Trump's bombast to drive latino voters further away the republican party and hurt the re-branding of companies.
On Monday published the new ABC/Post survey, six out of ten republicans said he was a Trump agree with immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is a matter of balance, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has risen reached a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben carson's support now covers about half of republican voters, due in large part to their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten republicans said Monday the ABC/Post survey, that they prefer to choose a policy outside person than one who has government experience.
They are angry at the federal government.
Two weeks ago, the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey of Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa republican is frustrated with republicans in congress: 54% are ”dissatisfied” and 21% ”very angry”.
Jeremy corby's first appearance at prime minister's questions
Corby's first appearance on question time has been eagerly awaited her election since
Labour-the labour party's new leader Jeremy Corby faces David Cameron for the first time at prime minister's questions.
Corby will rise to ask the first of the six question a little after noon, and most likely, as well as the media that labour party mps are watching closely his performance.
Corby is required for this weekly show ”less theatre and more facts”.
He has also said, that could leave some of the opportunities their colleagues for treatment.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test of corby's leadership after he was appointed to the shadow cabinet and he spoke to the trade unions the central organization's annual meeting Tuesday.
At the same time, the labour party leader's decision to stand quietly for the national anthem during Tuesday's memorial service, which was held the Battle of Britain -air war 75. on the anniversary, has attracted criticism from conservative mps and appeared in several front-page story.
Corby's decision to not sing the national anthem has attracted the attention of
Corby's representative said his ”standing reverently quietly” and that he recognizes ”the Royal air force to the bravery of the British air war.”
Corby's shadow board member, Owen Smith, said the BBC Twon Newsnight programme, that he would have urged the labour leader to sing the national anthem, despite the fact that, in his opinion, the king of the room should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow minister has refused to being involved in corby's inner circle, citing the differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Originally, less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant said, that the alignment differences regarding the party's position in the European union and the government grant of the roof are ”built up” also labour inside corby's after the appointment.
Corby said the trade unions the central organization of the meeting, that the labour party propose an amendment, which would remove the entire ceiling.
Hours later, the shadow government's work and pensions secretary Smith stated that the party was ”quite clear” about it, that they only oppose the government's plans to lower the ceiling of 26 000 to £ 23, 0000 pounds.
Corby will become the fifth labour leader, which David Cameron has faced over the last decade, when he has been the conservative party leader.
The labour party leader has promised a new approach to policy and now says that he is ”joukkoi stan” ideas for questions to the prime minister, and received more than 30 000 proposal.
Islington North -area mps Corby has said that prime minister's question time the character is too confronting and that he intends to refrain from as well as a witty pun that spike game promised instead to focus on serious matters such as poverty, inequalities and young people's challenges.
Corby has said, that the shadow of the government's economic secretary, Angela Eagle works his deputy to survey classes when Corby does not participate in - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corby has also suggested that also other colleagues can be sometimes let to speak, and he said approaching her house of commons speaker, John Bercow, on the subject.
When Cameron took over in 2005, he says he wants to move away from the kind of political theater, which often combined with the prime minister's question time, but he was later forced to admit failure.
From then on, when they began to be televised in 1990, prime minister's questions has been an important measure in assessing the director's judgment, he of the house of commons control, as well as his position as other mps, although critics have criticized the survey for hours about, that they have become just a caricature, which requires far-reaching reforms.

Metcash start a grassroots campaign Aldin sector against penetration
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA in their store Aldin invasion of Southern and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the IGA-retailers ' market share in Southern and Western Australia before Aldin 700 million dollars for the attack.
Aldi is preparing two distribution centre and first store opening early next year in South and Western Australia, which is coming up to 120 stores. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen its relationship with local food brokers and build IGA brand to the mainstream - and social media marketing as well as through events such as the Adelaide show-exhibition of the season.
IGA merchants and procurement is jump, and the brand you like in dunsborough in’to become an ice cream manufacturer Simmo's offer a taste of IGA stores, and shop owners are selling discounted tickets to australian football matches to its loyal customers.
Metcashin is expected to reveal more details of the defense strategy of 29. September, when this food, alcohol, and iron goods wholesale sales to organize annual investor strategy day.
The game is a lot, for South and Western Australia formed a total of nearly 30% Metcashin IGA trades of the area, and their profit margins are higher than Metcashin the eastern states IGA network.
South and Western Australian shoppers are notoriously parochial, and IGA retailers have a much larger market share than New South Wales, Victoria and queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24 percent in the west compared to the eastern states, 14%.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that the Aldi to grab about 5% of these two state of the food market within 12 months of the first movement opening. The turnover obtained by all actors, but mainly from independent retailers.
This week in the report, Morgan Stanley analysts Tom Kierath estimates that IGA retailers could lose annually to 360 million dollars in sales and Metcash can lose 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year in the south, 25 and the west 30 movement, which produced 500 and 600 million dollars turnover in these areas.
Food and food sales and the amount of the loss Metcashin high fixed cost base can pay Metcashille about $ 13 million operating profit loss before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states mainly Aldille and Cole, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were all more loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashin food and food sales will decline by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and to 2.1% in 2018, so that its market share will decline in 2015 by 14 percent to 10.3 percent in 2020.
Last week a leading investment fund managers and Magellan Financial Group founder Hamish Douglass told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could ”quite possibly lose a decade”.
Metcash has refused to answer publicly Douglass comments.
It is however understood, that Metcashin board member would have taken the last week to contact Douglass.
IGA's market share has fallen since 2010 18% to 14%, and the yield Metcashin food - and food business, which will convey products around 1200 IGA-retailers, have dropped 43 percent since 2012. This tells the operations debt financial reduction, when sales and margins are under pressure.
Wholesale sales, however, to assert, and has invested annually more than 150 million dollars, in calculating the weekly hundreds of product prices to the same level Combes and Woolworthsin with, helping IGA retailers to refurbish their stores by adding the faster growing fresh food, as well as bringing to the market a better selection of private brand products.

The Australian tennis association president Steve Healy supports Thanasi kokkinakis of
Thanasi Kokkinakis earned rather honor than a criticism of the behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered by the recent storm, which has raged his friend Nick Kyrgioksen around. He deserved rather honour than criticism of his own behavior, said the Australian tennis association president Steve Healy.
”Special Ks” -name of the talented duo junior member Kokkinakis had involuntarily publicity of a case where Kyrgios was annoying Stan Wawrinkaa Montreal Masters competition.
Soon after, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the referee was forced twice to distinguish between Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison each other, when Harrison declared: ”desperately needs one should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should beat that kid.”
While Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up his bat after the cramp spoiled his potential profits Richard gasquetin of the US Open, Healy has been kokkinakis's staunch defense.
Right now the young man is in Glasgow to compete at the Sam Groth with a second place singles in Bernard Tomicin with the Davis Cup in the semifinals against Britain.
”I quite strongly believe that Thanasi has just pulled into the fray”, Healy said.
He broke his bat when he loses a cramp because of the US Open, but he is not the first player who breaks his bat frustrated, and I felt Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved very well, also quite a provocative situation in the US open at the Harrison's with and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a fine family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard, is suitable according to the team, and so on, and he has never had problems with other players. He's respected in the locker room, he practices hard, is in good condition and is quite calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged on its merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take kyrgios to according to the Friday start in important games, describing this as ”a joint decision” to all a good solution, but support still canberra kind of a return to the team vakikalustoon.
”We want the team to be fully focused on the game and not all polemics [Kyrgiosin] around,” Healy said.
And Nick has elevated really fast, like for example, Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he grow up in the public eye, and has made some horrible mistakes and deserve everything they get kritisismin. But we have tried to support him, trying to help him understand the consequences of their actions, and I believe that is the best as well as the team that to him, if he spend some time away from the public eye to ponder these consequences.

2016 election: a National survey, Hillary clinton's lead Bernie Sanders is narrowed on the side
Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton to continue a double-digit lead in the democratic nomination race, but senator Bernie Sanders catches up to him.
Clinton now supports the 47 percent of democrats voters (declined 58%), and the second the Sanders supports 27% (up from 17%).
Vice president Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will leave, according to the president of the race, but he is worth 15% of the democrats voters.
More than five months before the primaries started most of the democrat voters said, that it is still too early to say that they had decided who to vote for.
The clinton supporters are standing in their own choice behind however more rigorous than other graduate supporters.
Clinton's popularity has fallen in several population groups in last month's CBS News Poll-a survey after, and at the same time, Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton has a strong lead in the women and moderates, but his lead has narrowed.
His popularity men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton head start under 50 years of democrat voters in the precinct is lost, and he is even now Sanders.
Clinton, however, leads to a clearly older voters.
Last month Clinton led Sanders double-digit century liberal, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's democratic voters said that they supported Clinton so enthusiastically, if he becomes the party's candidate.
A quarter say they support him with reservations, and 15% would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
Not very surprising, that clinton's current supporters are very likely eager for his support during.
Opinions are confusing most of those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
There where 48 percent of democrat voters said they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the republican top man Donald Trump said the same thing a few more republican voters (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him as a candidate, the most popular answer was, that he has suitable experience (16%). After this, the most popular answers were, that now is the right time for a woman president (13%), and that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions as well as the opportunity to be elected was also mentioned.
As vice president to influence a potential presidential candidate, 57% of democrat voters would like to see him already in the race - although a third is of a different opinion.
When asked democratic voters who they would select the second party's nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
Clinton's supporters among the more than half said that they would choose Biden, who is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to solicit the democratic candidate, Hilary Clinton led Sanders to grow. If Biden were to go, the lead is 20 percentage points, but if he opt out, the figure is 30.
55% of democrat voters considered that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential elections, but this figure has, however, declined from last month's 78 percent.
This scale Biden falls short, but the proportion of those who held him was voted tävimpänä, has grown.
When democratic voters were asked what is most important to the candidate, however, they raised their opinions sound attributes above.
Also last month anyone in the democrat candidate or possible candidate is considered impossible as a candidate to these voters.
Democrats candidate or potential candidate doing well in certain key things in the party among voters.
A large part of Clinton, Sanders, as well as Bidenia honest, trustworthy and strong leaders.
Biden did the trio the best of honesty, while clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democrat voters said they consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, which is two times more than Sanders (15%), but 27% said that they have no opinion of Sanders.
Democrat voters also, generally speaking, whereas Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically of the same mind.
When you look at all these points, about a quarter of democratic voters say that they have no opinion of Sanders.
Although Hillary clinton's personal e-mail address and server to use when he was foreign minister still raise the question, the majority of democrat voters are satisfied with his explanation and said that it influenced their general opinion he had of her.
However, the matter is different, when you look at America as a whole.
Half of americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about one-third is satisfied.
People's opinions were divided in march soon after the matter came to the light of day.
The majority of americans said that the e-mail controversy affected their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten republicans say that their opinion of Clinton has changed for the worse.
Although Clinton's own party's voters consider him as an honest and trustworthy, this is to him still the problem of all among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has dropped 8 percentage points over last month, as well as 15 percentage points since may.
62% of registered voters said they consider Clinton honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of the entire country of registered voters also do not like the Trump honest and reliable.
As well as Clinton that Trump, however, is considered good leaders.
Of the six included in the study are the kandidaatista Bidenia, Carson, and Bush is considered rehellisimpi.
Sanders is considered as a rule, honest, but not many people have an opinion of him, just like Carson.
The margin of error in the study, which was attended by 351 democrat voters, is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes to Donald Trump's close to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates collected in the new survey, half of all the votes, leaving the other to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country support the increasingly strong Trump, whose support has risen in the previous, before last month's Fox News election debate to the CBS poll, 23% on Tuesday published a survey of 27 per cent.
Carson, however, risen at the same time soared six % to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well in different demographic groups and is eclipsing the Trump of the high educated of the republicans among voters.

The former governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and florida senator Marco Rubio are tied in third place with 6 percent.
The margin of error in this latest, in September conducted a survey of 376 republican voter sample is +/- 6%.
Last week released the latest CNN/ORC's poll showed Carson to be on the rise in the polls: he has 19% support the republican, and Trump is ahead of him at 32%.
Also, the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was significantly above Carson.
Carson's popularity rose in the last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon to no avail, although the Carso apologize to Trump faith into question.
”We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday campaign visit to Iowa.
Five fraternity members accused of Baruch College first-year student's death
Nearly two years after the student died in a fraternity hazing ceremony in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains area, the murder has been increased to five people.
In New York City at Baruch College -the university of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity members went to cruelly Chun ”Michael” deng was attacked membership rites during September 2013, and after that took her to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say deng was blindfolded and her back-loading was more than 13-pound backpack full of sand, after which he was repeatedly knocked to the ground when he tried to walk on the icy field toward the goal.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
Fraternity members did not call the emergency number deng's pyörryttyä, but according to allegations, waited an hour, before they brought him to the hospital, police said.
They had, however, time to replace deng's clothing, search the web for information about his symptoms, as well as contact the fraternity's national president Andy meng ... I ask for this advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
”At this point, members began to hide the ritual equipment and, therefore, in practice, set themselves the brotherhood of the welfare of Michael deng's over”, chief of police, Wagner said.
Deng for not been revived, and he died the next morning.
The autopsy, according to Deng received repeated blunt force blows to the head, torso and thighs.
”Too many families have had to suffer the brotherhood simputukseen, when every year at least one student has died as a consequence since 1970”, Doug Fierberg, deng's family representative lawyer, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members should be held accountable, and this authority of the step is important.
Monroe county grand jury in favour of it, that the first five members will get the charges of third-degree murder
32 other brotherhood members, including the Meng, had also prosecuted violent simputtamisesta and criminal intrigues.
”We don't want to get liability only on individuals. If that happened, is somebody behind the organization, which accepted the situation, either formally or informally, they must also get responsibility”, Wagner said in Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and national brotherhood broke his connection to the local departments.
This happens, when the Us central bank to raise interest rates
The interest rate hike will come, and the rising rate of the market crash, bond yields rise and the economy falls into recession.
This we know.
What we don't know is how long all this will go or how long it takes.
The past there is very little help on the timing, what comes specifically from the economy.
Declining revenue has taken its first lifting after sometimes of only 11 months, sometimes it has gone as long as 86 months.
The us central bank aggressiveness, raising interest rates has been often, though not always, the determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That's why the Us central bank officials are so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on it, because interest rates will be raised, but mainly the normalisation of the situation to go to the time to the development cycle.
The equation is really a number of variables.
Eventually, however, market participants are able to observe that all rate hike related fuss has been oversized.
”The central bank's first global economic crisis since the increase will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as ’cheap money’ era ends,” said Capital Economics global affairs, main economic expert Julian Jessop in a message to customers.
Instead, we expect that the U.s. interest rates and a gradual return to normal, albeit still low, level is a cataclysmic shock, which many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it would have effects.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react to past performance on the basis of:
As the market has seen over the past months, the rate hike of waiting can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a reality, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
”It seems that the return on capital has a tendency to stop at 12-24 months, the first after the increase, which again possibly reflects a delay in monetary policy”, Deutsche Bank analysts said a recent study about what happened to the central bank after the increase.
To be more precise, the last about 35 years during the market are usually strong, around 14 per cent rise when approached for a raise, 250 days after the situation is relatively flat (average increase 2.6 per cent), and the normal status has been achieved 500 days after the average yield being six in the last cycle of 14.4%, multiplied by Nuveen Asset Management company's leading equity strategist Bob Doll on a recent analysis, which was published in Barron's magazine.
Deutche Bank according to the effect of the shares is usually a clearer increase of the cycle at a later stage, when the yield begins to fall.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank is faced with certain challenges that were not previously available, and which can accelerate the recession.
Such is in particular the gross domestic product, which is going to be closest to the all-time lowest level before the central bank rate hike.
Deutsche Bank says after 1950 in the 118 to raise the nominal annual GDP is only twice been below 4.5%.
Although the year 2015 in the second quarter, the figure was 3.6 percent, few believe it to remain, when the third quarter has advanced 1.5 per cent, says the Atlanta federal reserve bank.
Raising interest rates in this fragile economic position can be risky, and raises the question of, ”is this time different,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants are prepared for the central bank to increase throughout the year, and all are waiting this week's Federal Open Market Committee -committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
Although many strategists and economic experts believe that the committee can approve the increase at this meeting, the futures trade anticipates only a 25 percent likelihood.
”Our research shows that since 1950 all of the increase in the cycle have so far appeared to increase the leverage effect of a super cycle, where GDP has surpassed the recession preceding the peak very quickly after the recovery has started”, the report says.
By contrast, now the running has been exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been a sighting of the season's worst.
Nykysyklissä the central bank has been waiting far longer than the last recession ended: the record has been 35 months, and now running is already 74. month.
Fixed income has also been volatile markets waiting for the rate hike, and the model is somewhat reminiscent of the capital of the findings.
Main difference is that the central bank moved its line, its effects appear faster bonds than equities.
Bond yields of direction seems to change immediately to the cycle of the first increase/surgery.
The increase of the cycle at the end of the bond yields will fall immediately,” Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab-strategists believe that interest rate increases lead to longer - and shorter-term bond yields for the convergence, thus paving the yield curve.
High-yielding bonds often produce better in such a situation, although ”we are still cautious return regarding the search for,” notes Schwab fixed-income analyst Kathy Jones in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market is already adapted to the central bank's alignment of expectations.
”The dollar strength and inflation expectations decline, in addition there are several signs that the market has adapted to the tighter monetary policy outlook,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is flatter, the credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened the line through.
In general, companies whose business takes place mainly in the united states, they were winning, when the interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with large debts, perform worse, when the dollar rise in value makes their products more expensive in world markets and their debt will become more expensive than what they are financing.
”History shows that ’high-quality’ shares usually are profitable the first rate hike in the following three months,” Goldman Sachs analysts said customers in the report.
Companies with strong sales, passed weak net sales of the companies years 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases after an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility stocks, performed better than lower quality companies. First-mentioned average value was 4 (percentage points) and the latter 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Those companies that have a lot of floating rate debt, are losing the most, Goldman said.
Speculation on the stock market outside of the consumer has the opportunity to benefit from the value of the dollar rose.
Also save you can get to win higher yields, although experts disagree about how quickly the effect is felt.

Earlier this year BBC Radio 3's manager, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel need to do more work than in the past the audience to reach, because the british know less about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only part of the BBC's offering, which was criticized commercial competitors toes stepped on culture, media and sport, the special committee during the hearing.

B&Q boss said that the eastern europeans on the cheap working laborers are popularity behind
Britons are increasingly using hired services, Veronique Laury said
From eastern Europe came to the profession the number of men is rising behind
As a result of professional men directed to the Screwfix stores will be opened in 200 more
Meanwhile, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q stores around the country
Author Rupert Steiner, the city's general ledger in the Daily Mail newspaper
The british are said to give up about hammers and paint brush, and pay a rather skilled eastern european laborers to do the home improvement work
It seems that if you are handy with a hammer or haka to paint the walls, you are now in the minority.
The british see the wages are still more handyman to take care of do-it-yourself-work homes, says B&Q's behind the company's boss.
The home renovation retail chain that owns the Kingfisher, the new executive director Veronique Laury said that the popularity behind is the Eastern Europe of skilled workmen number and the fact that they offer their services to a fraction of the price.
This leads to the fact that Kingfisher is planning to open 200 new workers to head to Screwfix-stores and the closure of 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said that he wants more women to work in B&Q-stores, because eight out of ten in the store to make the purchase decision is specific to the fairer sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population need to take into account: today, there are more single female households, which make more home improvement work than before.
Laury said: ”the majority of our stores the staff are still men.
We need to get better balance.
Half of our customers however, it is women and 80% of product purchase decisions are women.
Women have a big role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women, which led to the British FTSE100-the index of the most important companies. He has built a management team again so that there is as much man - and woman men.
Kingfisher is almost the only company whose group is exactly 50% women, including its executive director and the financial director.
Laury said: ”This was a conscious decision - the dissimilarity is that here the main thing.
Not to be difficult to find a good woman management team.”
Kingfisher reported a decline in both the half-year income for that sale, after the group take the blame for store closing costs.
Trend as a result of Screwfix and B&Q-stores owner Kingfisher is about to open 200 new business
Three of the ace board of directors decided to resort to force legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were received pretty quickly.
SAK's and other employees of the central organization of the sharp head began to force in the same way and as a result the country stands on Friday workers a broad view of the meaning of the expression.
Time many believe that a stand also sanity.
Asked, deciding to strike, when anyway goes bad.
There is even a established resistance.
Online more than 50 000 people have already been declared, that will participate in the protest but will go to work.
The good old consensus at the time this would have been impossible.
Of course, I had no internet, where to protest, but openly scab declared to be against would have been a small people political suicide.
Million-member trade union organisations in a few tens of thousand people protest doesn't much care, but food for thought it gives.
The trade union position is no longer so obvious than even twenty years ago.
Not everyone will feel the movement of the targets, the values have changed
The trade union movement operation of the attractiveness perspective, the government's drastic solutions can see also a direct gift from heaven.
When things are in season seem to be rolling under its own weight, so now at last union the issue of worker's rights, prominently and properly.
The government may thus want to maybe build the trade union movement's role, while membership in a trade union is seen perhaps the previous more necessary.
Are organisations what you think, so it is nonsense that the Friday protest will somehow stop the Finnish.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has already fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decrease, and unemployment will rise.
These things I thought would make the all of head.

Before the summer cuts, the effects were still affected by moderate more day, but now supplementary funding reduction seen in the new proportions.
Negotiations confidence with men will be launched next week, on Tuesday and they are resistant to the laws imposed by six weeks.

The us central bank must make decisions interest rates,
The rest of the world stands on the sidelines, when the Us central bank met for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision about the raise they interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A reuters survey of 80 economic scientist a little more than half of those who last week believed the central bank to raise interest rates, now believe that the situation is still not resolved and the interest rate is considered at the current 0-0,25% level.
This is a historic event, because, after the central bank cut interest rates to zero, is seven years.
The first time we are approaching a situation where the central bank will have the opportunity to get off the zero level and start the interest rates normalization,” said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institue for International Economics -economy institute senior fellow.
The us economy has been working relatively well, and the recovery has brought the balance sheets trillions of dollars and has created little inflation.
The central bank cannot, however, ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they will be ready for lifting, but signs indicate they also believe that the odds are increased.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20.00 (CET).
Delta State University shooter left apology note
After he shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before you shoot a colleague later the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote the message, which said he was ”sorry” about the first murder, and I hope ”that I could cancel it”, told the authorities on Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautierin police told reporters that the Delta State University in geography and social science teacher Lamb called the emergency number about ten in the morning

I love Amy and she was the only person who has ever loved me.”
Write a message after Lamb drove almost 500 miles to Delta State, where he killed a history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday as police surrounded when him.
University president William LaForge said, that the Lamb's and schmidt's between he knew to be no conflict whatsoever, but that ”clearly the Lamb's mind was something”.
Authorities said Tuesday that despite Monday published the allegations, according to which the Lamb would have thought Prentiss was in relation to Schmidt, did not have ”any information or evidence” of any ”love triangle”.
Shawn O’Steen said she was Prentiss married for about seven years and described him as a ”good person”.
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O’Steen told reporters that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter, who is ”shocked”.
O’Steen says that Prentiss and her daughter were ”absolutely best friends”.
Lindsay Knowles, according to Prentiss worked at home online. The Sun Herald, according to Knowles was Prentiss a close friend.
Knowles told that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb with about three years.
”He always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police told the Lamb called relatives at some point Thursday to tell them that ”he did not go to jail”.
When the police aim their Lamb highway 1 near Greenville later that same night, Lamb stopped his car to the side of the road, left it there and ran to the woods, where to shoot himself.
Lamb has a doctorate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015, told the university's website to find the merit list.
Stars that lost charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), in recent years has been hard.
In 2001, he got sick with leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to rumors, he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All this really takes its toll.
Manchester united's Luke Shaw is out for months a double fracture due
Luke Shaw got a double fracture in his right leg in Manchester united's to lose with PSV Eindhovenille Champions league match.
Although the defender was left in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hoping that Shaw would get to play yet this season.
Injury caused Héctor Moreno reckless tackle 15. minutes after 20-year-old Shaw was plunged into PSV's area.
She was treated with 9 minutes on the field and him had to give oxygen before reaching the hospital.
Van Gaal said: ”He has a double fracture in the leg and he is now in the hospital.”
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after that, and then cut in Manchester.
This is terrible. The boy comes to Manchester United at 18 years of age, suffers from difficulties and after playing brilliantly, and now this.
When I was in the locker room, he had an oxygen mask on.
She cried.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture to take at least half a year, didn't he play in the group stage.
I hope that he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got the red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the mexican players.
Van Gaal suggested that Italian officials made a mistake.
You can self-judge the situation when I say that it became a penalty shot and red card.
It was really bad for a two foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted the following: ”Thank you for all the messages, words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery starts now, I'll come back stronger.”

The English defender has an additional incentive for recovery for next June's European championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: ”It's a really bad injury.”
If any player is forced out of such injury, all are very sad.
Our players never intends to hurt the opponent.
Moreno broke his leg, when he played for the Mexican team in Van gaal's Holland in the 2014 world championships.
”Moreno's taking this hard, because the purpose is not to hurt the opponent, and when I heard that the injury is really bad, it's a bad thing,” Cocu said.
I didn't see you in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it seemed as if he [Moreno] would not have touched it, but I didn't see Luke tackle.
Moreno told SBS6: ”I Know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel so terrible because of this, I'm so sorry.”
PSV's Andres Guardado was taken to the hospital, too, Chris Smallingin challenge him.
I guess David Cameron feel Loraxin this better?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, doesn't take long before you learn almost by heart.
Not only so, if you're David Cameron.
When holiday-time child care provider service asked the prime minister from his favorite children's book, he chose the Dr Seuss The Lorax book, 1971, published in the environmental story.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes SuperCamps-corporate website, published in the message, and continued: ”Funny, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoyed reading this book to my children, because it always seems to find the image or message, which we have not previously seen.”
All this is true, but the next song, which Cameron supposedly describes the book's plot, is a summary of the 2012 film version, with a rather brief original text of stuffing was added to new characters and details.
”Inside the walls of the Thneedville town, where all the nature is gone and even the air is a commodity, Ted hopes to win the girl of his dreams heart side filling Audrey's wish to see a real tree,” the text says and describes the love story, which, in 1991, the dead Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not enough yet suspicious, cameron's text sounds in places like it was taken from the Internet Movie Database website for finding the Lorax movie plot summary, which begins as follows: ”within the walls of the Thneedville town, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, Ted-boy, hoping his dreams, Audrey-a girl's heart on my side.”
Taking into account that Cameron is publicly an active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unversed in the book's plot. There's a young, nameless boy to hear how local wildlife is destroyed by the greedy, tree-beating and, on kutova the once-ler, ignoring the story name from the short, viiksekkäästä creature Loraxin, who ”speaks for the trees”.
Such relatively invisible to the PR task is probably outsourced to your assistant, who has apparently never read the book 20 times in a row for the kids.
The prime minister's spokesman said that the text probably come to cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was cameron's staff, but did not comment on the matter for a moment more.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger, stay to the side of the English team, but it was still a hard place
Playing against Pakistan in the Uae is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England is selected to tour, I don't believe that the last time a 3-0 series loss recurrence is likely.
I would shut the guest wins out.
Alastair cook's side may be less experienced than three years ago the team, but it is accompanied by good kierrelyöjiä and the team's mindset is strong: they don't have scars from 2012, only the youthful positivity.

Related information: Adam Lyth fell to the English cricket team, his place will be Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth team is understandably tricky analyze me, because I'm his head coach his in Yorkshire.
His seven games will have been good against attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricketers are judged on their results on the basis.
Joe Root's selection for example does not have any uncertainty before the release, because, as I have said before, the players have the best choice of factors.
About a hundred points more, and lyth in the season the team could have continued, but he was actually in charge of their own destiny.
I hope if he gets more run in Yorkshire, another possibility comes to the front.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised lyth's attitude even when he's not performing quite as well as it could have, and it doesn't surprise me. Lyth is above all a team player.
It is troublesome to answer the question, how long a batsman can get mark to leave.
Lyth was elected seven times to the national team, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times out of.
Only Compton got a chance to play home and away.
The only complaint is that the English chose Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean, when Lyth was in top condition, but it wasted the opportunity is now past.
Alex Hales comes in, and it is batter which I appreciate.
He is a cricket player that something, which we in Yorkshire we saw early this season, when he scored 236 points against us the Trent Bridge pitch.
Her need to give at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this of course depends on the team composition of the United arab Emirates.
Is juggle the idea of moeen from the spacebar to open the Cook next door, allowing the field to be an extra pitcher, but may be kept to a four-speed, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why a batsman can hit out there, and this left-hander has already shown himself to be quite a cricketer.
Moeen does not necessarily make you the task to count on in Worcestershire, but he has them three and there is not much difference.

Paul Collingwood comes in a white ball game, and brings both energy and a ruthless glimpse.
I always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it playing or coaching, and she has the same exploitable brains than Mahela.
Sometimes a new voice to the dressing room to refresh the teams, even though their message would be the same as before.
Collyn team of guys we got, Ben Stokes, the rest are one-day, Root was given the same break against Australia, and I have at least no problem with this.

Such decisions are never made lightly.
The british departure from the EU (Brexit) in favour of can take the win, if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy for the Uk to keep the EU have to day by day increasing problems, although not taken into account even cordial, Jeremy ”Is it yes or no?” Corby's appeal to the labour party leadership or the trade unions the central organization of the indignation of Europe on Tuesday.
Also foreigners have their own corby their and Nigel Farage.
A european diplomat guy explained recently that because the EU is so deep in a variety of crises, all of which are no fault of their own, some member states are tired of britain's self-centered agenda, which is full of disagreements causing concessions and distracting contract changes that these states are for the most part want.
At the annual meeting in Brighton trade unions the central organization decided not to also want them, if they are holding back on social protection.
We could even call it Dave's and George's selfie agenda.
Prime minister and minister of finance late the summits or in foreign capitals organising bilateral meetings, take a photo of themselves in famous local monument in front of either a local eye to do with or without him, and then came home, saying that the victory of the supporters of the reforms.
It's all about me.
A european friend of mine, who wants to outward-looking britain of the EU-the tent on the inside - ”Don't leave us alone with France”, Berlin says - suggests that certain of the capital of the short-sighted by the ministers and officials are now at a point, they don't care about we stay here then we'll go.
Germany's cautious and moderate chancellor Angela Merkel's ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the action before it gets ruined in the same way as it became too long viipyneille Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohlille (16).
The French François Hollandella is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
He, too, is a fading force.
Poland can be a nationalist right-wing government, the Spanish left-wing.
It is hard to see these countries uhrautumassa selfie for the british, when their energy would be better directed to prevent that Scotland will leave the United kingdom - they don't want that, either similar to their own separatist trends.
So, my friends present, some of these ministers can even design a deliberately useless remarks to do with the Scottish national party in the style of the British 2017 referendum during the campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
”The resumption of talks was arranged in a story” and ”re-negotiation was of no importance to the British.”
Europeans have experiences of how ravenous Fleet Street newspapers can be and how the EU-skeptical press despots are, what they weren't Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum time, when in 1973 started our membership received a confirmation ratio 2:1.
They can vaguely recall Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunistin, who made a name for himself by writing ”EU straight bananas” when he was Brussels correspondent for the early 90's.
Ed Miliband was perhaps a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They include a motley array of taxes, shunned for guys, phone hacking foreigners as well as persons, whose domicile is nominally elsewhere and who own most of the big newspaper we.
Tony Blair, in fact, think of them just as well, but realized that if you are in a cage libidinous gorilla with bananas is to abandon the distraction, unless you want to be the gorilla's lunch menu, and later still for dinner.
In fact, Miliband was blairilaisempi than Blair himself, what will cameron's renegotiation trick to resist. Bair namely had agreed to the principle of the EU's rejected constitution behind, which French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press did not give him that either never forgive.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who patted me kindly on the back westminster's parliament house on Monday (I told her she didn't have anymore time to spare on me), seem to be a danger to adopt again Neil Kinnock in the 80 boycott be to attract a strong pay strategy, which was a mistake then, and now.
Although it may take time, however, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not me, but no doubt Andrew Marr that the BBC-from the couch to the Corby left on Sunday.
Corby's official position in Europe is, to put it politely, evolving.
He said, that would have us standing reform at the EU.
Well, the majority of the people of the United kingdom independence party ukip's war paint-intoilun as well as the conservative party hurjimpien nationalists outside can certainly settle this opinion at the back.
Hilary ”Benn, but no Benn fan,” Benn said in this way, both radio and tv this week, when his inner boy scout had wanted to admit that corby's choice to appoint the rugged John McDonnell of the shadow cabinet of the secretary of the treasury was a bad idea.
It reminds me of the ' 70s, when his isäpappansa he lasted on tv trying to be disloyal to the labour party colleagues in government on the point, without that go, however, so far, that would lose the government its place.
Hilary pinnistelyt were more attractive.
But the fighting, that we stay involved ”in a situation where any” - Benn utterance - not what McDonnell said, and judging by what Corby tell pääreillä and to mps in a private meeting Monday night.
What is it epähierarkkinen, emotional, and personal image that Corby wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the communication discipline is the most important around-the-clock tv era, and particularly the social media vortex, which is a breeding ground for paranoid delusions and fraud.
As McDonnell said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing her to keep the labour party support a referendum campaign to be self-evident.
Simon Jenkins seems to think so.
But Mcdonnell's and corby's basic circling regarding membership of the EU (and therefore in line with their Benn-mental-controlled economy and anti-capitalism of the past with her) is no longer just an abstruse discussion of the kind of left-wing dissidents, for whom small differences, narcissism is the central dogma in political nahisteluissa.
What will be his duality in Nato (Tom Watson is convinced siitäm that the Corby campaign in order to give the), foreign diplomats just need to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why Paris or Berlin would be worth wasting political capital (they, too, are distrustful voters) concessions to the British, when it can be completely unnecessary?
The united states is already somewhat disappointed with the british for the weak military performance of Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the cost-cutting conservative government was in power, as I was reminded on Monday of the British Influence Security Forum -security forum started.
Experts criticised Public Health england's e-cigarette-reviews
Scientists have said that the state-funded agency of the claim that electric tobacco are 95 % less harmful than traditional, originated in the 12 spirit of the meeting, part of which had connections to the tobacco industry.
The British Medical Journal (BMJ) written by experts agree with the lancet, was criticized by Public Health England (PHE) uses the evidence in its report to the electric cigarettes.
PHE released this ”milestone”-its report last month describing it ”as a comprehensive overview of the evidence”.
Several researchers have, however, questioned the knowledge of sustainability and refers to the connections of some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
Medical journals, the Lancet published last month in the editorial, which was attacked PHE:n the main conclusion of ”exceptionally shaky ground.”
Two other BMJ in writing the relevant researchers have pondered whether the claims ”built on the rock or in the sand.”
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine -school of European public health professor Martin McKee, as well as the University of liverpool's clinical epidemiologist professor Simon Capewell said: ”public health the main principle is that practice should be based on proven effectiveness.”
They say that the public would expect that PHE's claim of ”current best estimate according to electric cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than traditional tobacco” based on the evidence of detailed assessment and modelling.
In fact, it comes from one 12-person meeting, which developed a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDAN) to synthesize their opinions from disadvantages, which are combined with various nicotine containing products, and this meeting results summarized research.
McKee and Capewell say, that one meeting of the sponsors was a company called euro swiss Health, which the director general describes the past received funding from the Bristish American Tobacco -a company with independent research.
He also support the BAT:in the public health powers of the sustainability report, they say.
One meeting of the 12 people announced that it has received funding from e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the financing, which he is said to have received previously, the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
Panel members selection criteria are not told, but the panel included several well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also tell me the study received industry funding.
Others have not known their expert again tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE:n tobacco leader.
The group produced the study ”a lot of telling grant,” that there is a lack of ”undisputed evidence regarding the disadvantages of most products and in most parts of the criteria”, McKee and Capewell write.
Any of these connections or restriction does not, however, mention the PHE's report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE:n claims that ”so far there is no evidence that e-cigarette works as a route for burning children or non-smokers” would be premature.
PHE's health and wellbeing director professor Kevin Fenton said that the BMJ:in the arguments put forward have been answered previously.
He said: ”electric cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking.”
Half of lifetime smokers will die riippuvuuteensa.
All the evidence suggests that e-cigarettes posed a health risk is relatively small, but we have to keep the long-term impact study.
PHE:has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it doesn't show, especially when the relative dangers compared to tobacco is so much public epätietoutta.
Almost 80 000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases and smoking costs the NHS every year 2 billion pounds.
Explain current evidence - that is, although the electric cigarettes are not risk-free, the disadvantages are only a fraction of the traditional cigarette disadvantages we have national responsibility in our area.
The BBC should give up on Eastenders, said the former Channel 4 director
The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop programmes like EastEnders or The Voice transmission, and that commercial competitors ”would give anything” for such smash hits as, for example, in Albert Square street investment arising from the soap series.
Johnson said that the licence fee should be used only for programs for which other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticized the BBC for the fact that it put public service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, a tricky left competitors of the most watched programs and channels, like BBC4.
After the BBC director-general Tony Hall said the company wanted to make more cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he tried to Channel 4's once six-year period to establish a relationship with the BBC, to no avail.
”I don't understand the idea that the BBC to produce and broadcast programs that were clearly subsidized by way of competitors,” Johnson said of the house of lords communications committee as part of its research into the BBC's future.
If the licence fee is regarded to catch up - and I'm not sure that it would be this viestimelle or long term a good idea - it should at least limit the production of such programmes, which others do not do and that.
The Voice is sent to the main broadcasting time, because its future is to gather as much support as possible.
The idea that no one else seems to program, it is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: ”I don't understand why a regressive tax would be to finance programs that could be financed without state support.
The Voice is one of a kind and EastEnders another, admittedly inside the house carried out.
Frankly, the other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand how it is about the public service broadcast.
I don't think that it would weaken the BBC at all.”
Channel 4:the year of 2004-2010, the led serial entrepreneur Johnson said that the BBC is guilty of looking at the number of hunting ”out there working in people's objectives, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support.”
He made his comments to the BBC's most popular series resemble the former Sky's leader Tony ball's comments. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture of his in Edinburgh to propose that the BBC would sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smallest audience of the public service programs, ”go to BBC4, which often can not be measured by looking at, but the BBC have such responsibilities and can then 4 billion pounds of licence fee income in defense of hypocrisy to say that ’of course, we are doing all of these unknown programs that no one see’”.
They put they broadcast the scene, which no one ever came to see them.
The licence fee of Johnson said to the committee: ”I Challenge you to find a regressiivisemmäksi the system who get the most value for.
Of course you all think, we all think that £ 150 a year will get a lot of value, but I don't know if it's true for those people, to whom £ 150 is a lot of money, because they don't use the BBC much.
The former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also testified to the committee Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its reith as early mission ”to inform, educate and entertain”.
He said that only a small part of the BBC production are now classified training - he said the figure of 1 % of TV production and 0.1% of the radio - and that it should take the model of Australia and the Canadian broadcasting company and change task form ”to inform, educate and entertain".
What comes to partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on the Proms-concert-like events, which according to him are shown on television only a few, and the alliance of commercial companies such that all of these should be available online.
”Sound genetics” enables the brain cells to control the sound of the waves help
Video showing how nematodes change direction instantly, while the voice-the impulse hits them.
Scientists have raised the worms, which are genetically modified neural systems, so that they can be controlled by the sound wave of the eruption.
Tiny nematodes change direction as soon as they hit the sonic impulse, which is too high for the human ear to hear.
The impulses work by turning on genetically modified commercial nerve cells with ultrasound waves react to the film channels.
Related: researchers read and write aivoaktiivisuus light
The researchers said that the worm show new, voice genetiikaksi designated, the method of functioning. That ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain-, heart - and muscle cells of the body from the outside.
California La Jolla at the Salk Institute researcher Sreekanth chala my told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure, in which the human brain, the electrical impulses in parkinson's disease.
Nematodes do not normally react to the ultrasound, but chala I found that when they are surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles confirmed by ultrasound waves, which then travel through the worms in.
Set the ultrasound waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, structures that have some worms in the cell membrane.
The sound waves will make these ion channels to open and activate their attached cells, is reported in the journal Nature Communications published report.
Prepare ultrasound controlled nematodes, chala my edit my worms genetically so that part of their business the nerve cells are TRP-4 ion channels.
When chala my used ultrasound custom built worms, micro-bubbles amplify the sound waves and pass them worms, which they put on top of the edit business nerve cells.
Method has some of the same features as optogenetiikan, groundbreaking tool, which gives scientists the opportunity to turn nerve cells on and off pulses of light using.
Chala my say, however, that sonogenetiikan use can be some of the advantages of optogenetics compared to.
Unlike light, which must be sent to the optical fiber along the desired location of the brain inside, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue without hindrance, so they can be send to the brain a skull on top.
”We believe that gene therapy and the therapeutic virus can use to be possible to get the people in the nerve cells momentarily responsive to the ultrasonic signal of specific neurological treatment in a clinical environment”, chala my say.
Other applications could focus on the muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Eight golden rules for student dormitory living
Has been 11 years since the ignorant age of 19, I moved to the dorm. That's when I was still helmets and moral relativism, but only now I remember ärsyttämi my people of contrived smile - and numerous, long complaints from others.
A large part of the have learned can be summed up in eight simple rule.
Changing the dorm can be anything nerves the fair completely scary.
It's tempting to chatter: tell me where you're from, do you like in the intervening years and where, what you think of Corby, and why ”I really don't love or hate even got any marmalade because really it's just yeast extract HAHAHA I found my room”.
Take a deep breath.
And help also other to take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find those people that you like, not those whom you don't want to talk about even if my eyelashes were on fire and they would share the fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often change cocktail party, movie night of the venue and the general would hangout, but they are also those places where people dress up and corrective underwear.

University is a tough place to intro verte.
Your room should be a place of rest, but many of the dormitories form one room to another wander of culture, which is friendly, social and cause lifelong friendships.
It can mean hell for someone who is trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture does not give you permission to say ”I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you now need to remove that I can collect back the energy which I spent in my conversations with you".
Try to sense when a student guy is tired of socializing on - and perhaps send a text message to the door to knock instead.
Knocking when came: the knock.
There was a guy in a student dormitory when I was of the opinion that if the door wasn't locked, he had been called in.
He saw quite a story.
Make friends bake of the season.
Because you start university baking trend of the peak of the season, people door knocking the chocolate brownie dish with and self-presentation affected to some extent, less weird, less ”welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions” -50-figure types.
Self-made treats is a great way to make friends.
Residential your partner experience accountable talk, and it may be that they will combine to face the tasty surprise.
This of course depends on, you know how to bake.
Ill-mixed flour-sugar-rasvamöykyt likely to get people just pretend to be sleeping when you knocked.
Food stealing is a common crime in student dormitories.
Understandably someone a chicken is stealing, but what if you take just a drop of milk in your tea?
Ask for and check milk from the owner.
It is quite possible that they give you permission, even if the boiling internally.
If someone steals your thing, it's annoying and you get my sympathy - but I adult more than my dorm mates, who mixed the colostrum detergent to punish those who stole it.
He is now in prison.
You should not make noise so that people do not get sleep or study.
Not only to be decent people, but because you're like that proverbial spades beat mass boiler.
Girl in my hallway asked the neighbor if they could call the drum and bass music more quietly, because it was three o'clock in the morning and he had exam in the morning.
The answer was increase the volume.
When they finally went quiet at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before put your music loud, locked the door and left the three hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if my future spouse would happen to change the same dorm with you?
Or conversely, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you kept your dorm partner coming puolisonasi, teamed up with you together, you separated, and after you saw him every day and possibly lose all contact with your friend to him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot dorm partner is really not your future spouse, you could at least try to talk some sense into alapäälle.
That's exhilarating being in the moment when you notice that someone has left his keys locked in his room, cross-keppostelun and bullying between the two is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but is reversible in the moment.
You can give a useful and fun lesson on safety by hiding something - but don't ever mess with someone in the room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and dropped the keys in a glass of water, which I then put in the freezer - but do not pay their property the blue sticker on the ceiling more than twice.

The state abolished the Y-train of Cattle - passengers pissed off, "just idiotic"
From helsinki to Raseborg Karjaa travel on the Y-train stop from passing in march.
News provoked anger that the train started the night shift, the rise of the passengers to Helsinki central railway station.
In particular, the shutdown strikes siuntio, said commune resident Torbjörn Bengtström.
Quite idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and work you need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be any other stick than the political will - or lack thereof.
Bengtström said HSTV's interview in the video coming though the tractor to the capital.
Also the rest of the new land train changes.
On the main line passing through H - and R-trains combined to form a new R-line.
Purolan position the lake away and the Nuppulinna in Tuusula remain disabled.

The contract period will change at the year end and close down those routes is in the whole country.
Autumn at the latest add to a new four-year contract will accept later monetary affairs committee.
Siuntio kind Bengtström considers that the state rail cutter is a short-sighted action.
Made the same mistakes, what has been done in the past and repeated them in a very systematic way.
Then comes the remorse on top.
Y-train is also used in the other than raseborg and siuntio kind, because it's fast and skip several stations.
People Krazzy Pöyryä annoyed by train to the city area farther away from the journey of destiny.
"It is specifically bad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said kivutessaan Y-train.
Little relief is in store.
The beach track is probably coming with the new train service, which replaces the Y-train Helsinki Region transport (HSL) area in Kirkkonummi.
This adds to the cost of HSL:ie in practice, the area municipalities and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to figure out the various options and their impact on level of service and ticket price," said HSL's managing director Suvi Rihtniemi.
The cost is still impossible to assess accurately.
Rihtniemi tell you that the number of passengers, based on the HSL has paid Y train about a million a year, the ministry of course, much more than this.
The main line of the upcoming R-line left between the two stations.
Instead of Ainola and a sauna rock in the train, the number of doubles.
The whole country stops for a total of 28 small stations and numerous routes.
The ministry no longer buy train traffic on the route from Joensuu-Nurmes finland, Tampere and Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.

Sixten Korkman wrote the chapter of Capital topicality -book: "Marx you should read"
The global economic crisis have raised the surface of the Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his years 1867-1894 published his major works in the Capital, writes the communist party's former president known as George Hook today published in the book marx's Capital topicality.
"He will now be taken more seriously than in a long time," Hook writes in his preface.
Marx's assessment of capitalist development of the economy, internationalisation and penetration increasingly to all spheres of life, capital concentration, as well as money capital and fictitious capital, the growing role of have proven to be amazingly prescient.
Chevron organised by Capital-seminars based on the book, the author list can also be found in Aalto university professor, a respected economic expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes Marx to be the topical "now and forever".
Not guess the former Business research institute and Industry delegation to the ceo, however, marxist have?
Not at all.
Korkman told me on the phone that he liked the Marx current economic thinker, but as a rather interesting societies distinguished himself as a theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary connoisseur.
"The usual perception is that the history of ideas tells the dead men from the wrong opinions", Korkman start.
It is true that marx's predictions went heavily wrong.
Although Marx understand the industrial revolution the nature and meaning, he pulled the capitalism of the beginning of too far to bulky to conclusions, Korkman consider.
But Korkman sees, however, the value of marx's radical approach.
"More relevant Marxissa is that he asked good questions," he said.
Now let's talk again Marxinkin interests such as wealth distribution.
"Marx can perhaps provide inspiration for everyone who wants to understand the big picture, a technical revolution as a result of the changing world", Korkman analysis.
But, what should the government tomorrow to decide, not Marx not help.
His mielestäänhän capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Still, Marx is worth korkman's view, become familiar with.
"In the' 70s Marx could not read," Korkman says.
"The maoist and trotskyist and other sects hated all capitalists, but even more to each other".
Today the discussion is more diverse, and also Marx can be approached without in the ideological and political baggage.
"Every social scientist should explore marx's idea of the world - as with other classics", Korkman says.

Yes, finns are sensible and calm people are," Kujala said.
In different parts of Finland will be held on Friday also local protests.
Friday's protest is in many ways exceptional - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Trade unions on Friday organised a big protest is in many ways the most interesting and exceptional.
For instance, it has found in the Finnish political history is a very good reference point, said university of Jyväskylä professor of sociology emeritus Martti Siisiäinen.
As such, it is no wonder that the trade unions protested.
If it does not do so, it would raise the board front put your hands up, Siisiäinen said.
Very right-wing government has struck a Finnish corporatism in the tradition of the core sections - and also one of the points that have been the Finnish welfare state development.
The government's rough missing contract law.
This has a lot of features of the fact that the trade union movement really trying to get to his knees.
At the same time also the trade union movement is the mirror look of the place.
A mirror is needed, for example, therefore, that the trade union movement by no means all wage and salary earners to support the Friday view of the statements.
New now is the sharp division, which demonstration time in among, which the trade union movement will be participating in the demonstration.
Different parts of Finland gathered the unemployed were protesting the parliament house in November 1993.
If Friday's demonstration for looking for points of comparison, could it be the unemployed left the demonstration, in 1993, arranged a break-Thursday, Siisiäinen said.
In the middle of the deepest recession arranged the burglary Thursday collected together 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Aho (kesk), the government stumbles, labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the Finnish government and employee organisations, between had never before been as bad as the clearing of the bourgeois government.
Now the government and the trade union movement between the two are perhaps still worse than the burglary Thursday of a long time.
Besides, the power is now in Finland so a conservative government will never, Siisiäinen said.
The current government coalition is still in the way of interest, that it is so strict right-wing true finns speech.
Still jytky of the time were certain the old labor movement of the elements.
The scene is expected on Friday several thousand protesters.
Demonstrations have also stopped public transport and shut any day homes as well as schools.
Even if demonstrations get earners undivided support, it can become the largest in years.
Helsinki has in recent years organized about 300 demonstrations per year.
Their is side to side.
Traditionally, the Finnish trade union movement demonstrations have been quite peaceful - even if the policies have in recent years deteriorated.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration to avoid conflict, we are law-abiding.
Protesters seek to avoid property damage or destruction, Siisiäinen said.
In the late 1990s, however, new winds.
Protest culture has changed.
Membership of the EU was nervous about the farmers throw eggs and police prepared to get on top of the pig shit.
Firefighters strike last in the 1998 three months.
Spectacular strikes was also, inter alia, the pilots and air traffic controllers.

Kerkenna islands, Tunisia on the east coast do not attract foreign tourists, but many tunisians will head there in summer.
Its location, the islands are also suitable for the smuggling, for the trip to Italy belonging to the island of Lampedusa is just 120 miles.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 miles.

Just an ordinary taxi driver
Goran is just an ordinary taxi driver Bogovaðassa in Serbia.
His cab is not very good - the starter motor to draw to a close and already it has seen better days.
Goran's customers the most important thing, however, is that the taxi even moves, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is the 500 inhabitants of the little village about 60 kilometres from Belgrade to the southwest.
The village is situated next to the asylum seekers referred to the center, which is let mainly to families.
Center surrounding forests without family the passengers the men sleep in tents, lean-in and abandoned the car in what now anyone has managed to find or build.
The woods are also resident families, who are for one reason or another have left the asylum applications from Serbia.
Some stay also in private residences, but it is a public secret.
In the woods, among the Goran find most of their customers.
These are often exhausted - in the Balkans through a route requires a large amount of crossing borders and the weeks of walk in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
Arrival in the end Bogovaðan area, large human smuggling hub, people are death tired.
Goran along for the ride are mainly syrians, afghans, pakistanis, iraqis and kurds.
The best customers are syrian, he told the paper.
"They say things once and that is enough," Goran praises.
According to him, africans are trying to bargain.
That Goran does not like.
Hölö hölö hölö all the way.
First we agreed on a price, for example, 300 euros, then they dropped it to 200% and offer in the end 150.
Goran underlines its nice and good hearted man.
Money does not interest me.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he said in the book.
Goran told me he does work cheaper than the other and the billing was off the Hungarian border for only 50 euros per person.
The trip is about three hundred miles, the greater part of the comfort of the highway.
Colleagues are asking, I hear three or four times the price.
Goran will earn about 50 000 euros per year.
It is not a smuggler a large sum, but in Serbia quite a comfortable annual income.
Serbia is prescribed that the taxi you get carried migrants 12 miles closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about that: he knows the roads and shortcuts and take you along for the ride in miles from the border.
Then he shows his customers in the right direction and zoomed off.

Media researcher: Sipilä took a big risk
Sipilä, according to the communications required a diverse range of channels, and the prime minister on television and radio speeches are one channel among the others.
Also, such a direct speech channel will be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in parliament.
Sipilä didn't want to even estimate how frequent the way to the prime minister on television and radio talk comes.
Sipilä, according to the speeches don't necessarily always care about the future yle's channels.
If other channels registered in the channel, then we'll see.
Now used tonight on this channel, Sipilä says.
Sipilä, the Finnish economy is the extent of serious, that it requires a television and radio speech to the citizens.
This entity, what we are talking about, is pretty complex and requires a longer argument.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech is sent to the clock 21.05-21.20, as well as TV1 and Radio in Finland.
It can also be viewed on Yle Areena.
Sipilä took a big risk
Media researcher I hope that the Finnish television speech to tell the public from the government's inward turning.
Is there an effort to take the public debate of defining rights more firmly into our own hands and refuse a public debate on the issue of layouts? consider Stockholm university, professor Anu Koivunen.
Comes to mind the minister of foreign affairs (Timo) soini's recent comments that he won't follow the media agenda and not let it define themselves.
Democratic debate and publicity in the name of hope, that these issues are not related to each other.
We understand that the commercial media is indignant sipilä's notification.
It would be strange if the media field is not responsive.
Policy makers communication style you do not notice things in a democracy.
Media representatives role is, by definition, strive for it, not the politicians agenda are taken for granted.
Koivunen, according to the television speech is sipilä for a big risk.
Sipilä should be in his speech to bring to the table something new and special, so that set exceptionally high expectations fulfilled.
Today's offer to add to what we have already heard?
Or will he be able to talk to different tone, different way or different words or say something new?
Koivunen said that if there's just more of the same old, you have to wonder, why such a big gesture was made and Yle give it an exceptional time.
Yle to take this risk in mind, if it's not a specific situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that the company stamp is politicians or parliament and government viestimeksi, which is certainly not Excessive interests or the general line.
Sipilä sneaky bet
Sipilä's forthcoming speech is also important for it, what the prime minister left unsaid, media researcher emphasizes.
The evening will look closely, what Sipilä is missing and what is not, said university of Jyväskylä research coordinator Heikki baby seal.
Baby seals according to the tv speech is Sipilä clever move, because this is how it gets to bring your views forward without the gravel sound.
This message will be a large audience without the journalistic filter, unlike the press conference, where reporters can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypass the media and speak directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media interprets the speech something wrong, because clarifying questions not from the present.
Baby seals, it is very important how Sipilä appear on tv - casting droplets of sweat, my hands are shaking hands.
He compares sipilä to isähahmoon, who now told the people what to do.
If Sipilä able to present his case well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government would at some point, because this person as if speaking directly to another person.
Such (Us president Barack) Obama and partners enthusiasts on a regular basis.
Truly exceptional
Policy researcher Erkka Groove to keep the prime minister's speech to the citizens truly exceptional.
According to him, such has not happened in a decade that a prime minister speaking directly to the people.
Extraordinary time requires extraordinary means, the Crevice said.
The researcher surmises that the prime minister wants this to get the finns sympathetic to your front for extortion.
Employee organizations are organizing Friday demonstrations and strikes the government's actions against.
Left alliance chair Paavo Arhinmäki said on Twitter that Sipilä could keep his speech to the nation on the state of the parliament in the prime minister's declaration, when the talk would also discuss.
The SDP chairman Antti Rinne (sd.) again to announce the challenge he Sipilä dialogue.
Now is not the time mono pack.
Soon the half year's elections.
Indefinitely can't hide, Slopes to write on Twitter.

A psychologist advises: This is how you tell the children of the refugees
Many a parent has been forced in recent days to think about how to tell the kids to Europe to refugees seeking to enter the situation.
Or is it told at all?
It need not be taken forcibly to speech, the Finnish red cross crisis team member, psychology Ferdinand Garoff advise.
The smaller the child is worth protecting, and not, for example let them watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and anxious, he said.
If the child has however to come across a television news images of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it's worth taking up.
Debate is good to visit the child's starting point and listen carefully to what he asks.
The child's fear may be surprising.
They do not necessarily have them, which the elder imagines her scared.
Children should not frighten in vain, even though anxiety and fear, I guess.
Smaller children closely follow their parents behavior.
If the parents themselves remain in the conversation during a calm, the child feels safe.
Older children collide the discussion of refugees likely to be in school, playing with friends or online.
Parents is good to take with them up, if the thing I'm curious about children.
The fact is, not all people in the world have things very.
Parents can together with the children to think about how our family this will be taken.
Is the world we believe that ultimately, however safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also be a variety of education perspectives - some may want to protect their children, where possible, anxiety.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about the difficult things, the child will receive a model about how to deal with life in front of future difficulties.
This can be useful to him in the future.

This is why you can't get rid of the junk from your iPhone-program
Apple ceo Tim Cook.
At least a part of the Apple iPhone-the phone of bundled software can maybe sometime in the future to remove - but not quite all.
Apple plans to possibly in the future to remove some of their own software on iPhone-the phone, told the company's ceo Tim Cook Buzzfeed magazine interview.
The apple iphone found a set of programs, that relatively few people use: for Example, FaceTime calls, newsstand, Health, Stock market, Podcasts and Tip come to mind.
The latest addition to these programmes is the Apple Watch, which came to the update for the iPhone, although it is necessary only to apple's smartwatch owners.
Cook said apple's software removal is more complicated than it looks.
Some of the apps are linked to another iphone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook stated the work for buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention what apple's iPhone applications work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work that way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
Cook said Apple, therefore, in investigating the matter, as the company does not want to waste the memory space for users of the iPhone-phone.

The us Fed will try to next to tighten monetary policy
The united states following the recession begins to peak in less than a year, but more likely within three years after the country's central bank, the Fed will take action again after a long time to raise interest rates.
And financial markets the downhill turn before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it would start interest rate hikes, possibly as early as this week and no later than the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession could weigh on the peak of the first by fall and the financial market rate ground before then.
Or at least, if the world's largest economy and financial markets operate as they have been used - and if they react to the fed's monetary taps of blackmail as have done before.
Such conclusions are arrived at German bank Deutsche Bank london of market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in a broad long-term market and economic cycles in their study.
The bank share was more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study-a research report for the international suurasiakkailleen last week.
Research and report prepared strategists do not believe they know exactly when the Fed starts to raise interest rates or what the economy and market after the event.
Instead, they presented economic statistics cool facts and calculations, how the economy and the market have in the past behaved the fed's rate hike at the time of and after them.
Historical observations in addition, they will examine what the economy and financial markets, key variables are now in the same or another model than the previous rate hike of time - and possibly follow.
It is apparent that the economy and financial markets are now huterammassa condition to withstand rising interest rates than it has been in the 1950s.
The recession began may not be a year
The fed's monetary policy and its current stance, decided the leaders are along the last summer and early autumn implied that the time begins to be ripe to raise interest rates in the.
The first rate hike in more than nine years may come as early as this week.
The issue will be resolved Wednesday and Thursday after the fed's management committee, the so-called open market committee meets to decide the issue of the two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raising the so-called Fed funds rate -the refinancing rate in June 2006.
Then ended exactly two years of relatively regular but at a time in small 0.25 percentage point rate hike of the series, which the Fed raised the rate by 1.25% to 5.25%.
Financial market symptoms began in 2007, the Us risk pitoisimman housing financing difficulties, and a year later the financial crisis tore a global judgment day into a nightmare.
The great recession came in 2009.
The last time the financial markets and the real economy serious misfortunes began more slowly than in the past the fed's rate hike after the is typically.
Accordingly trials were then tougher and rugged more than at any time since the 1930s.
Deutschen strategists are screening the world's major economies rises and falls as well as financial market developments from 1950 onwards, and in some places always early 1800s onwards.
The fed's rate hike and the economic and financial effects they are reporting on since the 1950s.
The recession and the beginning of is the first rate hike from the lapse of a peak time less than a year, most often in less than three years and an average of less than three and a half years.
Financial market rate increase has ended a year-two after the fed's interest rate increases began.
The Fed is alternately raised and alternately lowered interest rates to the 1950s after the beginning of a dozen different long-cycle degree.
Each time has deviated from some of the others, and the times has a review of the relatively scarce, so their basis can hardly conclude anything for sure in the next rate hike of the impact.
Strategists pointed out that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The financial crisis of the decisive reasons let alone the culprit was not necessarily to obtain unquestionably found out even decades of research.
But three aspects of the crisis that led to and its destructive force in the growth of those reasons is probably somewhat unquestionably clear:
1) the Fed, the euro area, the ECB and other world's major central banks in the 2000s interest rates too long too low.
They patched were the techno-bubble traces, and increased at the same time the following.
2) the Financial and the real economy in different parts of the decades of accumulated over and already too large, the amount of debt the central bank of ylilöysä of the monetary policy impact even greater.
The birth date of economic the history of the largest debt bubble.
3), Especially the financial economy approximately pidäkkeittä packed crazy cheap debt financing swelled with most of the financial market areas the previous economic history of the largest price bubble of the shares in real estate, bonds, and commodities.
It barely generated fierce controversy, that the still more complex debt levers on the heights of elevated financial market were rare in a dangerous and unstable mess, when the Fed and other central banks last drove interest rates upward.
Debt levers on tuned financial structures, let alone the valuation of the bubbles didn't last as the time after the rate hike had started and debt financing costs were turned upward.
The risk of true financial crisis, and it was followed by the great recession.
The larger the bubbles and more debt
Deutschen strategists do not guess what happens next, but give tuumailun the subject by mentioning, for example, the following types of issues:
1) the Fed and other major central banks are now kept its monetary policy stance still lighter yet longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were before the crisis for too long, too low, have they now been even longer still lower.
2) Debt is not a long time to be mad cheap, like ten years ago, but now the debt money is cheaper to produce literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the financial and the real economy the debt cargo is not eased, but now the economy in different parts of the prolific lot heavier debt load than before the financial crisis, or for that matter ever before.
3) More free-flowing than and lower than the central bank of the issuance of the departed liquidity has largely left the financial markets and get a key securities and asset allocation kalleimmilleen then financial crisis prior to the summit or never.
And not strategists downer only financial market warning signs, but in addition, they pointed out that even the Us economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of heavy from the recession in that model than in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
The real economy is in other words, the unusually weak condition but accordingly to financial market pressures and the risks are incomparably larger than before the financial crisis, when the Fed's next move be to tighten the money taps to be tighter.
Perhaps the French bank Societe Generale strategist Albert Edwards ' view of the future is not so strange as at first glance may be affected.
He is already a good amount of time coached the bank's international investor-clients of the fed's next täyskäännöksiin:
First the Fed to raise interest rates, then the financial bubble burst - and soon the fed's is the time to extinguish the financial pieces of even larger QE money injection.

Ahtisaari in the Guardian: western countries rejected russia's proposal, al-Assad crowding
Western countries fight over three years ago, the Russian offer, which the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad would have to relinquish power, told president Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan in which al-Assad would be some time later receded from power in style.
Western countries do not, however, stuck to the proposal, because they believed al-Assad would fall anyway in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012, the UN security council five permanent member states.
Ahtisaari, according to Russian ambassador Vitaly Tshurkin lists him in private conversation in a three-point plan: the opposition couldn't get the arm, the opposition and al-Assad must immediately get a voice contact and for al-Assad to relinquish power must realize soberly.
I Know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all of them, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit Down, Martin, I'll tell you what we need to do, Ahtisaari recalls the guardian's interview.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari told the forward that he tshurkin's message to the united states, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin not confirmed to the press the content of a conversation, but Ahtisaari says it is not two words.
Also, UN diplomats refused to comment on ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-assad's forces were already at that time made a number of massacres and the main opposition groups refused to all contracts, which he would have remained in power.
The british foreign ministry Middle east department, former director Sir John Jenkins welcomed ahtisaari's speeches doubtfully, because of his experience according to the Russian was not at any stage prepared to discuss al-assad's fate.
Officially, Russia has been supporting al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point of ahtisaari's argument is that Tshurkin spoke in Moscow by delegation.
If he would have told me tshurkin's speeches, I would have answered that I want to hear the same president Vladimir Putin, so I can take it seriously.
Jenkins says he would be in the case of suspected that it had been putin's gimmick to keep in power one of al-Assad support the.
The flow of refugees to their own work
Ahtisaari's negotiations during the Syrian crisis had been dead for about 7 500 people.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220 000 last year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The refugee flow to Europe is their own work.
I don't see any other option than to keep these raukoista people good care.
We pay the bill now, that we cause, Ahtisaari told the press.
Asylum seekers, the arrangement of the central mall Tornio, finland
The government of Northern Finland, designed by asylum seekers, the arrangement of the centre will probably be established in Tornio.
A centre would be established in the city centre empty the Tornio school building.
The interior ministry has searched for the need of a suitable place, so that the flow of refugees to the Swedish border to get a better management.
Helsingin sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to submit to the school building space solutions for the ministry.
Tornio city council, vice-president Sauli Hyöppinen (vas.) that is not true.
When the entire council was not convened and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to call a council meeting next Monday to decide the matter, he stated STT.
The debate conference was 36 delegates 43.
The arrangement of the centre, opposed to 13 councillors.
Its on the basis can be waiting for a decision to be positive, Hyöppinen said.
Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city received contacts on Monday, and the response was fast.
Contact the lyceum of fit of an estimated 500 asylum-seekers at a time.
The expert has to check that it can be applied to such use.
Location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would be a functional, Nousiainen said.
Sipilä I still hope labour market options for extortion
Prime minister Juha Sipilä (centre) according to the publicity in the holiday bonus of halving the treatment should be only part of the government's objective in soliciting the work on prices.
The government will take according to her, however, happy to accept the alternative package, if the social partners succeed in such agreement.
Sipilä told parliament reporters that he's not been in contact with the labour market organisations.
He also does not know how seriously organisations are looking for substitute ways the government announced in working life extortion.
If such a contract arises, we take it without any more welcome as part of the overall package.
Holiday bonus of halving would be the Finnish view, as a means of working, because it targets almost all wage and salary earners unlike, for example, the government envisaged in the Sunday supplements of the surgery.
The social partners can be agreed between the holiday pay for the surgery, because they are enshrined in law rather than collective agreements.
The government share these views on Wednesday of next week to the parliament work to tighten the provisions of the state council notice.
Sipilä, according to the organization of proposals should be known this before.
The final deadline is this not.
Legislative leaves then moving so when the train is moving and it goes all the time more difficult.
Now is a great time.
No such thing in the long go, if the will is there, Sipilä design.
The government last week published by on the list is, inter alia, the epiphany and the ascension modification remunerated holidays in working time without a reduction.
In addition, the first sickness of a salary cut, overtime cut in half, Sunday compensation be reduced by 75 percent and the holiday will be shortened.
The reforms will be implemented by overriding the law for trade unions past, which has aroused strong criticism.
Wage-earners organisations arrange activities on Friday a major demonstration, in addition to which often trade unions have declared political strikes.

The karelian language for place in Joensuu, finland
The city government softened its earlier steep position of the karelian language of street name signs in order to bring the Joensuu city centre.
The new decision is a proper and important to think of the karelian tradition of cherishing the whole province.
Joensuu did not declare yourself the karelian language as the capital, because it has no historical justification and the karelian language is not an inherent part of the identity of a region.
Joensuu region the spoken language is heard more in the eastern savo dialects.
New after the decision of the city center is not the karelian language street name signs.
The city of joensuu is, however, a case by case basis for good consideration, ready also to the karelian language use, for example, info boards and tourism marketing.

The us central bank policy makers are sitting this week for two days of the huge mahogany desk around the long-awaited meeting in deciding whether the time has come to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
The other end of the central bank of the ornate, two-story meeting rooms is a wall painting in the united states.
The map is a reminder that central bank chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues will set the nation's economic interests above everything else.
Congress has decreased the central bank shouldering the dual responsibility: they must maximize U.s. employment and keep prices stable.
The great depression after central bank leaders have, however, accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is this third requirement can be a decisive factor on Thursday published decision, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted. The decision on whether the U.S. economy ready for weaning in a way a record of the incentive, by the end of 2008 to almost zero in the remained short-term interest rates has brought .
Although most of the information showing the economy growing steadily, the recent turmoil in the global financial markets can be made in advance alert to central bank officials, former säikymme, what will volatility increase. Just how would be affected if the federal funds rate -the reference value will be raised even one percentage point in the quarter.
”Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and the most important points to be followed”, said Lindsey M. Piegza, the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co. ' s main economic expert.
”However, I believe that if they are looking for the legitimacy of the interest rates unchanged for lodging, increased the uncertainty of the world market has enough valid grounds to expect yet,” he said.
The central bank decision, consensus has not been reached, which in itself already generates nervousness on the economy.
Bloomberg's recent survey, about half of the economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets expect the central bank to delay raising as a key indicator, according to the opportunity for growth is only about 30%.
This refers to the securities market to decline, if the central bank to raise the level, unless the decision-makers could work to soften the blow by promising that the next hike will not happen in the near future.
On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average index rose 228,89 points, or 1.4 percent, to a new chapter in the 16 599,85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank to keep the level unchanged this week, told John carnall the parking lot, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group -rymän main economic expert.
”It is surprising, if the central bank to raise interest rates right now,” he said.
If policymakers raise interest rates, ”they need to see a lot of effort to line its support to financial markets, so they don't panic.”
Other experts claim that an elevated level of calm in financial markets, because it would remove the uncertainty about when the central bank operates.
Just a month ago it seemed that the central bank would this month in raising interest rates a quarter percentage point, thus taking the first small step towards monetary economy mode of slow tightening, which certification would be the American recovery stability.
Yellen has said the spring and early summer, that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that the liberals require to choose his more economic development.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1%, which is the lowest figure in seven years and close to that level, which the central bank considers full employment boundary.
Wage growth has shown signs of picking up.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2 percent annual target, central bank policy makers said the main reason for this is the significantly lower oil price a temporary effect.
Economy ”clearly the biggest interest rates, and also needs them, taking into account the labour market tight situation,” said Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics -the company's main economic expert.
Financial markets around the world, however, were shaken last week, when China devalued their currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell by up to 16% may view the record of its, as investors feared china's slowing economy to slow down global growth.
Market is this month, recovered somewhat, and the Dow index is now nearly 10 per cent less than in may, peak reading.
The central bank decision makers, market turbulence is an additional factor in a complex equation, which tells as the interest rates will raise.
”Without these financial market events, and last weeks news coverage of China's economic weakness, the makers would tighten the level of this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate center special researcher, as well as former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision-makers are waiting for at least a month in order to get a better idea of the effects.
”Possible effects on the Us economy are still quite unclear, and they don't have much information at their disposal, what will the Chinese events consequences,” Oliner said.
The international economic welfare, the central bank is not a major concern, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making process.
In practice, the federal central bank has, however, become a world monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been immense.
In 2013, the then chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, suggesting that the central bank can be "narrowed” the amount of money increase, caused upheaval in the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly weaving themselves together, the central bank officials is expected to not only following developments elsewhere, also consultation to other central banks and experts in order to get a better understanding of the world economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is ”more art than science,” said Zachary karabel on, the asset management company Envestnet Inc. a global strategy chief.
The state of virginia, in Richmond at the federal reserve bank (Federal Reserve Bank) president Jeffrey Lacker pointed out this month that ”the central bank has in the past overreacted to the financial market unrest, which has contributed to be separate from the basic economic factors.”
Decision-making Federal Open Market Committee -the committee has been demanding a rate hike, and Lacker, committee members entitled to vote, appealed to the example of the years 1998-99 decisions.
The asian financial crisis caused the central bank cut the benchmark to 0.75 percentage point to three during the meeting ”despite its limited, identifiable impact of the U.s. economic growth”, Lacker said.
Years later, the central bank refuted these cuts.
The central bank should be put on economic stability a top priority only the largest during the crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, bank of England (Bank of England) interest rate determination-former member of the committee.
The latest turmoil does not come anywhere near its level, Posen says.
”No one wants a situation where raising interest rates is feared, therefore, that the market harmistuvat”, Peterson Institute for International Economics institute chairman Posen said.
The federal law on the central bank (Federal Reserve Act) to keep still includes two types of requirement, and not to mention economic stability. As long as this is the case, they did not think I should anticipate it.

Bariatric surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
The new study shows that mildly obese patients with type 2 diabetes of benefits you losing weight surgery can last at least five years.
It is however still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics losing weight after surgery longer than those who are treated in other ways than by surgery.
”Mortality data can take a long time,” dr. Robin Blackstone said. He is a bariatric surgery specialist, who wrote an editorial in the new research JAMA Surgery-periodicals.
Losing weight - i.e. bariatrisia surgery used a variety of methods stomach size reduction.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the food absorption.
Over the years bariatriset cuts is found to be effective to treat type 2 diabetes, but a large part of the surveyed persons has been morbidly obese, and their body mass index (BMI) is 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the ratio of weight to length is considered normal when it is between 18,5 and 24,9.
If your BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person's BMI is over 30, he is considered to be too fat.
You can calculate your own BMI:si here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
This new research for scientists for the taiwanese Min-Sheng General hospital in used since 2007, collected data are compared to two types of bariatrista surgery, gastric bypass and gastric reduction, type 2 diabetes lääkkeell in the treatment of people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the cut person of average BMI decreased by 31% to 24.5 per end of the fifth year.
At the same time, those individuals who were treated with other means than surgery, BMI remained at roughly the same 29.
Cut of the persons in 36% of diabetes completely cured and 28% partially.
For comparison, the medicinally-treated group diabetes completely cured in only 1% and, in part, about 2%.
In addition to blood pressure, triglycerides and ”bad” LDL kolestori ”were generally better in the surgery group,” the authors stated.
The researchers also followed the patients blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels in the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c value should remain less than 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, his hemoglobin A1c level dropped to about 9% to about 6%.
The pharmacological treatment group, however, it remained stable at around 8%.
This better ”glycemic control”, which improved hemoglobin A1c levels you describe, however, does not reduce mortality during the five years, says lead researcher dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team compared also the average results of the two different surgery type.
The fifth year, when it was compared to gastric reduction surgery has group, gastric bypass surgery been group had lost more weight (of 18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased the weight index of their more (to 7.4 and 5.1), decreased hemoglobin A1c -levels more (3.1% and 2.1%), and were more likely to have achieved complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone said that although the study did not show any survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where cutting the cord for longer life of the press people.
A Swedish study found that bariatric surgery use effect obesity had a 29 percent lower probability of dying 15-year period, when they were compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show any improvement in patients undergoing surgery on survival, Blackstone said, that the results are however encouraging for individuals whose BMI is under 35 and who are interested in surgery.
”The survey results are crucial in that they show that the surgery is safe for the lowest bmi group”, nor does it involve elevated death - or a kidney disease risk, he said.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their lääkäreidensä should take weight very seriously at that stage, when the patient's BMI is 27 and 30.
”I think we wait too long, before we take this seriously,” he said.
I believe that when people have collected these genetic changes, which permanently produced her body to obesity and diabetes, the situation of withdrawal is very tricky.

In the last four years children hand disinfectant ingestion has increased four-fold
Poison control centers across the united states have reported a nearly 400% increase in strong alcoholic hand disinfectant swallowing for children under 12 years of age children since 2010, told the Georgia poison center.
Georgia poison center director, doctor Gaylord Lopez, according to poison centres reported disinfectant swallowing cases under 12 years of age children rose in 2010, 3266 cases in 2014 16117 case.
”The children were interested in these products, more often and sadly a certain percentage of them will have the emergency room”, Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children are drinking disinfectant on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or to respond to the challenge on social media.
Youtube has videos where teenagers drink sanitizer to get the cheapest the rise of hops.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed disinfectant alcoholic I suuveteen in order to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant disinfectant scents can attract younger children.
”The child does not think that this is him bad,” Lopez said.
Many in more interesting (hand desein) are those with added fragrance.
There are strawberry-, grape - and orange-scented disinfectants, which are very attractive for children.
Hand sanitizer may contain alcohol any 45 and 95%.
Especially with a small child alcohol poisoning is needed for just a few iike a iittle squirt.
”It is really concentrated alcohol”, the University of Kansas hospital poison information centre, medical director mr Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you don't leave shots of whiskey lying on the table, but the hand disinfectant is left in plain sight, and if the kids get interested in it, it is a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six year old girl, who for some time then swallowed only four ruiskausta strawberry scented hand sanitizer to school, and he was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is two times higher than the adult drink driving limit, tell the emergency room doctor Chris Ritchey, who treated the girl outside of Atlanta located in Gwinnett Medical Center.
Nhaijah was slurring while speaking and unable to walk, when he arrived at the emergency room.
The doctor followed him over night in a separate children's hospital with potential traumatic brain injury symptomatology in case, for the alcohol made the girl fall over and hit his head, Ritchey says.
”It was really scary”, Nhaijahin mother orto and Scott said to CNN.
The situation could have been deadly to my children.
Lopez is recommended that parents and teachers would use non-alcoholic products or alcohol wipes and then transplant the disinfectant out of the reach of children.
Alcohol poisoning in addition, some disinfectants is connected to the deaths.
In 2013, two ontario women die for swallowing hand sanitizer, which contains a toxic, unreported ingredients.
The health authority will presume that the product contains methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredient.
In January in upstate New York, three fourth grade students were planning to poison the "mean” teacher by spreading the bacteria poison the classroom, the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it in class.
The police have to prevent the plan ”joutavana höpötyksenä” and leave disciplinary action to the school district.

Why witness executions in Oklahoma
If any legal intervention does not happen, later today, when a man will be executed.
If that happens, and I hope that not, I sit in the spectators gallery in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary -prison watching, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the death of the four official witnesses.
Receiver of the request in January, her best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I started freaking out about this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree to?
I agreed, because I thought it would be a good way to tell of the death penalty throughout the story.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Journalists of course have the opportunity to monitor the executions in America, and because of the applications is often more than the available places, participants will be selected through a terrible draw of the season.
Oklahoma has reduced the media to the reserved seats twelve to five.
Whoever then choose don't, look at the event cool.
I can't do it.
I'm gonna sit Richard Glossipin closest friends next to, and I have created him also my own connection to my months of phone calls and one two - and a half hour visit through.
I like a man.
We laugh often we talked.
The prison authorities say, you can't be both a witness to that reporter, so I don't get to be with my notebook and pen to record to what I saw.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One oklahoma journalist accused on Twitter that I've compromised puolueettomuudestani.
This is a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way she wishes, so you get to participate in.
To the selected vendor.
He admitted that ”could have set the words better”, but is still think that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has been a different opinion some say I have and I have written things with.
She doesn't say me what I should write, I would do so although he would say.
I said to him, that he may at any time remove me from list.
But he wants that spot is the international reporter, who writes on the matter.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the publicity will help the death penalty against the trend.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to the series I've been doing podcasts.
I will not use this again all the details through.
I can't say with certainty, that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions Barry Van treese's murder would make him in any case guilty of aiding and abetting.
But I believe that is a very strong chance that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe certainly that the death penalty law to the evidence was not enough.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And so this is the point, where watching her die.
I can't claim I'm completely unbiased.
There will be other suppliers who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it feels like to watch a man, which I like, will die unnecessarily.
The man was lured out of the Canning River -the river of watery police hunt after
Canning Vale officer remained dry, once she attracted the man out of the Canning River.
From perth, western native a man tried to throw the police off went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just meters away from the police man who tried to ”coax him gently back to the beach”.
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday beckenham to unauthorized intrusion.
When they found the suspect, this attempt to mislead them by redirecting Canning river.
He did not, however, reach very far.
”He was standing in the water saying ’I don't come off, come get me,’” says senior sergeant Shandeen Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used safer tactics: ”the condition of the police negotiations”.
”Sometimes people do funny things while trying to escape”, says senior sergeant Castledine.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is the most memorable example.
In 2006, the Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and trying to swim in the Swan River -across the river.
He did not succeed miserably, but it inspired locals to start a playful Ben Cousins -biathlonin design.
Peter Moody claimed the agents tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria stewards sought to infiltrate vakojaan his talleihinsa in recent years, and threatens to quit the competition immediately.
He blames the stewards and Racing Victoria integrity division claiming that they have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, the Lady Tatai late rejection on race day to do the treatment due to the last rivet.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for competition, and that he is in a bind, lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample after.
He has kept his tongue in check spy also about a year and a half, and didn't want that ”it would seem to envy”.
”I'm not going to say anything about this, and I have long been silent on the matter, but sometimes it frustrated so much that all unraveling at once,” Moody said.
They know that the situation will continue.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk upright in, and I want the owners to think that I will do my best in front of them.
When they begin to think differently, then I should no longer continue as a coach.
Then I would have to consider, what do I do license my.
Before Moody dropped a bomb racing.com-site interview, where he told reporters that the integrity of the department had tried to spy on his garage.
”A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Harold Brown, and dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I will name him when asked and offered him work in the garage with me, if he cares about you information on what to do there.
They clearly consider me to be a charlatan.
If that's the case, surely they should distinguish between their lawyers, as they have failed me to catch a existence.
Robert Roulston, Racing victoria's former chairman, David Moodie, Racing victoria's current chairman, and Bernard Saundry, Racing victoria's current ceo, were all aware of it at the time, and are clear about today.
Should I start to think that this is becoming personal?
Is the Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps shift the responsibility to others, other than the coaches about what's happening in the field?
Am I harmful?
Am I so harmful?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me aside, and I don't at all doubt that now the things I said possibly to get them to think just that.
But I'm now at a point where I don't care anymore, and it sadness me.
It really saddens me.
I pushed them to make a decision, which is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown in the long-term lidar in the cobalt study, and late rejection caused him to say, that could ”throw his license over the table”.
Moody, who is best known as the undefeated champion Black caviar's coaching, has invited the race-day treatment measures of the rule ”ridiculous” after the mud - or savihaude has been put on the horse legs, which is against the rules.
”It is against the rules.
I have to take full responsibility for it,” he said.
One of my employees put by mistake the mud on its legs.
It could have been a poultice last night.
It could have been it yesterday, as it was.
Because it was race day.
Moody may be facing a three-month competition ban on race-day body wrap uses, where the stewards started an investigation.
It is a joke.
People who draw up these rules, do not know anything about the horse.
”All we understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.

Melbourne Storm -team coach Craig Bellamy attacks against competitors wrestling assertions
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the two-NRL-rugby league champion favorite claims that his team's tackles would be part of the ”line”.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm ”wrestling” on your side, when it unexpectedly won the final qualifier in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could hardly conceal the reference to the Stormiin after it beat North Queensland and the Cowboys Saturday night in the finals of the qualifier. Bennett called the game rugby league's ”showcase” and said the two queensland teams have been ”very enthusiastic” about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said that they only focus on the ”contact” tackle.
Bellamy added that his confidence increased in two of the leading coach of the criticism of the Storm, for it means that they are afraid of losing the team.
”This always comes up - I don't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost to them, 24-2”, Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not exchanged any defense in our system or technology in our whole year. In the last six weeks we have only highlighted the contact taklauksissa, and it has brought us success.
Trent has been in the team for three years, and she obviously has a great team to coach, so he probably isn't used to losing, and so this was a small shock to him.
Funny how this always comes up this time of year.
Bellamy challenged bennett's idea of ”exciting rugby” by reminding the mentor he fact that Bennett coached by the St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010, playing ”boring”.
Wayne talks about the exciting rugby.
He considered it important compared to Saturday night's game in our Friday night game and told me how exciting their games were,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was criticized often to the fact that it is a boring team, and Wayne said, I couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that is able to play the kind of rugby that we consider exciting, especially when he is fast young guys.
The kind of game you want to play, when you have that type of player.
He brought it out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team will have guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt, in order to play.
I become more trusting when they say such things, because they are a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think our resistance to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm and Roostersien between the game was a point richer than the Broncos and the Cowboys between plays.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how it ended? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does the fact an exciting line of defence of the breach and the paint failure?
To me this is about policy.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm night is this weekend free, because they have already won the right to a home game of either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharkseja against next Saturday night esifinaali's AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta said that the team mates need to support an injured Jack Wilshereä before the Dinamo Zagreb draws
Wenger has also stressed the Wilshire is that it's only September and, assuming his rehab goes according to plan, there is no reason why he would not be christmas while playing.
This is the best case for the wilshire from miss at least the next four England games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he participates next summer's European championships.
A great pity this most recent problem is that Wilsheren last season's end was a strong individual's ankle after the injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the season starts.
”Such injury does not threaten career,” Wenger said.
It is a bone that never healed properly.
It is nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It is not related to his ankles or previous injuries, what he has been.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger admitted the player's trying to return to the middle of the season there is always an additional injury risk.
Forming is also uncomfortable model.
Premier Injuries Ltd.- company studies show that Wilsherellä there have been 23 different injuries after he debuted six years ago.
In addition, he is the last of five during the season played arsenal in 157 league games of only 65 in the game.
When watching arsenal in the larger whole through 2007-08 after six season eight it has been the second premier league team, which has lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger admits the vicious circle of chance, but Arsenal believe that their past through repentance of disability statistics continue.
”Sometimes when you come back from an injury can be prone to periods when the need to strengthen the body and acquire the competition,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body stabilizes, I am sure of that, and that he can make the kind of career than you deserve.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team, when Arsenal start in the Champions league game on Wednesday night Dinamo Zagreb play against it after Saturday as Chelsea'a and next Wednesday Tottenham Hotspuria against.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
”Try to maintain balance and give respite it needs players”, Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is the F-block clear sequel to your favorite, Maksimirin stadium in Zagreb is Europe's scariest.
Dinamo is also not lost on 41 of the match, after they produce their own ”Invincible”-campaign last season.
The stadium rocked Tuesday night earthquake, which magnitude was 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was ten in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions league surrender to Monaco, and her motivation still a distant dream to lead the team to its first European cup victory.
”This motivation is huge,” Wenger said.
Arsenal have never reached it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We are ambitious but we are not "dreamers".
FriendsFest: comedy series, which taught us the serious things between men friendship
It is striking how similar the descriptions is not in the series, especially when you take into account that men need to open up is more desperate than ever, and the young men's suicide rates higher than fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the largest cause of death in 20-45-year-old males in the Uk, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In the enterprise to seize the problem for Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced in the 2015 man of the year. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is this challenge facing the core.
A recent study was accompanied by more than 2,000 junior high and high school aged students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, a person's chance to recover doubled, if high enough prosenttiosa of his friends was ”a healthy mind”.
Similarly, those who were not depressed, potential mental health problems, the emergence of probability is halved, if they were mentally healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it should be first available.
This through social media to communicate time style goes, the content and response immediacy is often more important than the meaningful contact.
Digital our lives have doubled the need seems strong, happy and successful, although in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success dominated by values that psychologists call an external: money, image, social status. All this happens in the internal values - the inner longing for personal growth and friendship - at the expense of affecting deeper mental health we do.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money doesn't really get greater happiness.
Friends of fineness was exactly that, that it turned this focus upside down.
Any characters not defined by their work, but rather their personality, which stood out clearly interact with friends.
Joey and Chandler, with numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missed by Rachel - these humor come from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all of this, although they often are hesitant to explore their feelings fully.
Like the Samaritans-the organisation of the volunteers explained to me: ...”when I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I really understood how even the smallest interaction with a friend can make you feel better.”
Often contact us having men feel they can't talk to friends.
The old adage ”get over on” is strong, as well as the feeling that if I will open the problem, seen as a weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when trying to provide long-lasting coping skills.
It was highlighted by the men's friendship, small moments.

But the team did not offer to attack the side of much other than Nikola djurdjic's shot 34. minute that went barely over Kevin Trapp's goal post.
Instead, PSG have between the trouble of wasted inputs and poor finishing, particularly Ibrahimovic, who failed in all five companies only in the first half and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in ibrahimovic's touch immediately after the second half at the beginning of time.
He was, however, much more efficient in doing preparatory work colleagues, and just ibrahimovic's pass from Di Maria sent out the twist kick, which rolled to wiland's goal post around 52. minutes.
The second goal was finally an hour after the game through the sixth goal hit the uruguayan Cavan thanks, after Ibrahimovic was flicked forward maxwell's cross pass from the left.
It ran out of Malmö hopes to get back in the game, and only wiland was a great fight against David I give you luiz's direct kick should have ended the numbers down, before the exchange become Ezequiel Mackins paint was rejected on the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were one level higher than his team. The Norwegian said: ”the Senior Champions league game we had in December last year.”
After we've played only in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
My hat's off Parisian.
