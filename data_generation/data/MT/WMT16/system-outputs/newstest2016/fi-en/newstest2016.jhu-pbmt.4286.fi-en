Prentissin kuolinpaikkakunnan, Gautierin, the police officer said that Lambilla had a violent history, or criminal records.
Schmidt himself was included in the Lambin wrote a book in which he thanked the "powerful people" with whom he split the academic life.
They both taught social sciences and history of the plant, which has a total of 17 members of staff, and many of the students were involved in the courses of both men.

The UN leader says that the situation in Syria to resolve militarily
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's response to the fact that Russia is increasing its military aid to Syria is that the nearly five-year conflict "will not be solved by military means," and the lisäaseet will only worsen the violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and to support anyone in the non-discriminatory talks to find a political solution.
Mr Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the five permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - the foreign ministers on the occasion of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.

8 kannatuskyselytulosta which show that Donald Trump is serious
Some people have been trying to brand him a tuuliviiriksi.
Others see him just as a joke.
Part of the collapse of the wait.
While some Republicans have tried to hilata Donald Trumpia kannatuskyselyjen kärkisijalta away, it is not (yet) succeeded.
In 10 of the last 11 national poll, Donald kaksinumeroisella Trump has been at the head of century, and some people have begun to seriously consider what this means in terms of kiinteistökuninkaan nimitysmahdollisuuksien.
The mandate is, of course, still in the early stages.
These results do not mean that Trumpista is likely to become the Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was in the process of losing its lead nousevalle Herman Cainille, neither of which did not obtain any of the appointment of the Länder.
There is also a number of reasons why he would have problems in the general election.
Outside groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super Petroleum for PAC and economic organisation for the conservative Club for Growth, have, however, noted the persistence of Trumpin and started to use the money to topple him.
Following the recent kannatuskyselytulokset suggest that kiinteistökuningas is not just a passing phase:
Trumpin suosittuusluvut have done a U-turn.
Just before when Donald Trump announced his candidacy in the middle of June, Monmouth Universityn kannatuskyselyt showed that only two out of ten republikaania kiinteistökuninkaaseen responded positively.
By the middle of July the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Currently, six out of ten republikaanista takes Donald Trumpiin in a positive way.
About three out of 10 say that they are counterproductive.
These figures are correct, also in the first esivaaliosavaltioissa.
By the University of Quinnipiacin kannatuskyselyssä Iowassa republikaaneista last week, 60 per cent said that they welcome Trumpiin.
Two thirds of the republikaaniäänestäjistä would be happy if the Trumpista would become the nominee.
The CNN / ORC's survey last week, republikaaneista 67 per cent said that they were either "enthusiastic" or "pleased" if Trump would be the nominee.
Only two out of ten said that they would be "shocked" if he becomes the nominee.
Only Ben Carson will result in more or less the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent of the "enthusiastic" vs. Trumpin 40 per cent).
The next most enthusiasm for the cause?
Marco Rubio, only 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of republikaaniäänestäjistä would be "dissatisfied" or "shocked" if the rulers Bushista suosikista Jeb would become the nominee.
Trumpin the nature of the fire is not a problem for the vast majority of republikaaneista.
Even though Donald Trumpia has been criticised widely for his speeches and insults mahtipontisista, Monday's ABC News / Washington Post, according to the survey, 52 percent of voters in the Republican side kallistuvista at the national level, thinks that kiinteistökuninkaalla is a suitable relations gamble with the president.
Quinnipiacin last week, according to the poll, the first Iowan järjestävässä puoluekokouksen state, where the figure is the same: 52 per cent republikaaneista thinks that Trumpilla is a suitable relations gamble with the director.
According to the ABC / Post survey, 44 per cent, however, thinks that his character does not lend itself to act as president, and nearly six out of ten believe that his character does not belong to the White House.
The idea of Republikaaniäänestäjät totuttelevat.
When republikaaniäänestäjät are thinking as commentators, they are of the opinion that the Trump is a real option.
The CNN / ORC's survey, four out of ten had Trumpia todennäköisimpänä as an alternative to the question of who will probably be appointed as a candidate for the Republicans.
At the end of July, four out of ten were supported by Jeb Bush.
Julkistus data: Republican voters has not always been available to kirkkainta possible in a crystal ball.
In the last parliamentary term, at this time, four out of ten republikaanista was of the opinion that Rick Perry will be appointed as a candidate, and only 28 per cent supported the eventual nominee, Mitt Romneyta.
In any case, this shows that the vast majority of Republican voters to keep Trumpin campaign as a credible.
Even if Republicans rally to support the second kandidaattia, Trump win, though almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented arena is likely to have contributed to the leadership of Trumpin, which violates the Trumpin popularity is divided among a number of other kandidaattien.
A survey carried out by Monmouth Universityn at the beginning of September, however, showed that the hypothetical bilateral kisassa Trumpin and almost all the other republikaanikandidaattien, Trump will receive majority support in almost all cases.
He leads the Carly Fiorinaa 13 points, Marco Rubiota 14 points, Walkeria 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, as well as Rand Paulia, John Kasichia and Chris Christietä every 33 basis points.
He is with tasapisteissä Ted Cruz.
The only Trumpin a winning candidate did?
If they were to be pitted against each other, Ben Carson businessman Trumpin to win by a large margin of 18 points.
Barely a majority of supporters of Donald Trumpin have told us that they had made a decision.
A new CBS / NOW's tiistailta poll shows that only slightly more than half of the Trumpia voter is determined, the owner in their vote will go.
The situation could change, of course, and no one can be entirely sure of itself to say that never would change their minds.
46 per cent said that they can possibly replace kandidaattia.
In any case, the largest Trumpin competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurokirurgi Ben Carson, but those voters who said that they had made a decision, are two times more likely to be on the side of Trumpin.
Six out of ten republikaanista says that are in agreement with Trumpin about immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexicans immigrants "raiskaajiksi" kampanjanaloituspuheessaan, immigration has been at the heart of the debate in 2016.
Some people are worried that the latinoäänestäjiä Trumpin bombast to drive away from the uudelleenbrändäysyrityksiä republikaanipuolueesta and damages.
On Monday, the publication of a new ABC / Post survey, six out of ten Trumpin republikaanista says he is in agreement with the issue of immigration.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so there is also a Donald Trump.
Frustration has risen in the government reached a new peak.
Donald Trumpin and Ben Carson's popularity now covers about half of the republikaaniäänestäjistä, largely due to their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten republikaanista said Monday the ABC / Post survey, that they will choose a person outside the policy, rather than one that is hallituskokemusta.
They are also angry about the federal government.
Two weeks ago Des moines Register / Bloombergin Iowasta survey showed that three out of four Iowan republikaanista has frustrated republikaaneihin Congress: 54 per cent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "very angry."

Nearly a dozen varjoministeriä has refused to be involved in the Corbynin insiders, citing differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, less than one sixth of parlamenttipuolueesta originally supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant said that linjauserot regarding the role of the party in the European Union, as well as the government's avustuskattoa are "built up" after the appointment of Corbynin within the Labour Party.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the unions', that the Labour Party to make a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the professional and varjohallituksen eläkesihteeri Smith said that the party was "pretty clear" that they only oppose the government's plans to lower the ceiling to £26 000 to GBP 23 0000.

Corbyn has said that taloussihteeri varjohallituksen inquiries and Angela Eagle is standing in for him at a time when Corbyn will not take part in, for example, when Mr Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also suggested that the other colleagues can sometimes give to speak, and he is the President of lähestyneensä said in the House of Commons, John Bercowia, on this issue.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said that it wants to move away from the kind of political theatre, which is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but he was forced to admit failure at a later date.
Since it was first televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important indicator in evaluating the leader's judgement, his control of the House of Commons, as well as his position on the other MPs, even though critics have criticised kyselytunteja that they have become a caricature of alone, which calls for sweeping reforms.

South and Western Australia's shopping kävijät are notoriously parochial, and IGA's dealers will have a much larger share of the market than those in New South Wales, Victoriassa and Queenslandissa: More than 30 per cent in the South, and 24 per cent compared with 14 per cent of the eastern states in the West.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that the ALDI stole approximately 5 per cent of these two state of the food market in the first 12 months of the opening of the movements and turnover will come from all the players, but mainly by independent jälleenmyyjiltä.
In this week's report by Morgan Stanley in the analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA's retailers may lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash could lose $250 million a year by the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that ALDI will open next year in the South and West, 25 to 30 movement, which produces liikevaihdot 500 and 600 million dollars in these regions.
The sale of food and food products and the loss of volume Metcashin high fixed cost base is able to pay $13 million to $Metcashille liikevoittomenetykset before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly in the Aldille and Colesille, even though a recent Roy Morgan survey found that IGA's customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that the food and elintarvikemyynti Metcashin falling 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share in the fall of 2015, 14% to 10.3% by the year 2020.
Last week, a leading Investment Fund manager and founder of Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass liikelounaalla said in Melbourne that Metcash is "very possibly lose one decade."
Metcash has refused to respond to the comments made by Douglassin publicly.
However, it is understood that a member of the government had taken the Metcashin contacted Douglassiin last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent in 2010, after a 14 per cent, and yields of food and Metcashin elintarvikeliiketoiminnasta, which cares for about 1200 products at the IGA retailer, have fallen by 43 per cent after 2012, which signifies a diminution of debt financing activities, while myynteihin and margins are under pressure.
However, tukkumyyjä to assert themselves, and has invested more than $150 million per year on a weekly basis it has used to account for hundreds of product prices on an equal footing with Colesin and Woolworthsin, in helping the IGA retailers to restore their shops by increasing faster growing fresh food, as well as bringing the market a greater range of private label products.
Metcashin CEO Ian Morrice says that price cuts and the strengthening of shops have increased the appeal, and he hopes that the tukkumyyjä will return to the path of growth in revenue in the year 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australia's Thanasi tennisliiton president Steve Healy supports Kokkinakisia
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves the credit, rather than a criticism of its behaviour
Thanasi Kokkinakis sivullisena has suffered in the recent storm, which has been raging for his friend Nick Kyrgioksen around them, and he deserves the credit, rather than a criticism of their conduct, says Australia's tennisliiton president Steve Healy.
"The Special see what is known as" a gifted their younger Mrs Kokkinakis had unwittingly disclosed the affair, in which Kyrgios has annoyed Stan -kilpailussa Wawrinkaa this Masters.
Soon after that, tulisessa karsintaottelussa Cincinnatissa päätuomari was forced to sack Kokkinakisin twice and his opponent Ryan Harrison, when Mr Harrison said: "Kyrgios Wawrinkan should have been set, and I had to beat that kakara."
Even though the last time we saw the carve-up of Kokkinakis mailansa after kramppi tarnished his eventual victory, Richard Gasquetista US Openissa, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakisin.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow, with Sam Grothin competing for second place with kaksinpeleissä Bernard Tomicin Davis Cup semifinaalissa against Britain.
"I am pretty strongly believe that rähinään Thanasi has just been dragged," Healy said.
He broke the illogical krampin Openissa mailansa due to the US, but he is not the first player who violates the mailansa turhautuessaan, and I know the Thanasin well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But he has behaved extremely well, but also quite provosoivissa situations with the US Openissa Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around, he will have a great family around, and I think he has been treated more harshly.
He is a very mature until the age of 19, he works hard, see, according to the suit, and so on, and he has never had a problem with the other players, he is highly regarded pukuhuoneessa, he firmly harjoittelee, is in good condition and is a very calm and mature young man, and I think that he should be judged according to their merits.
Healy has also supported the decision to ignore the Kyrgiosta alkaviin important games on Friday, according to the action, describing a "joint decision" a good solution for everyone, but still subsidies vakikalustoon canberralaisen a return to the team.
"We want the team to be totally focused on the game and not all the polemics around [Kyrgiosin]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen very rapidly, as, for example, Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he aikuistuu in the public eye, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the kritisismin; however, we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of their actions, and I believe that it is best for the team and for him, if he spends some time away from the public eye to discuss these consequences.
Europe's immigration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders, to detain immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and shut down Serbia's southern borders with bated breath against those who were trying to enter the country illegally, and is aimed at stemming the flow of migrants coming into the country.
At the border was followed by chaos, when hundreds of migrants gathered in neutral territory, and the Serbian authorities reacted tyrmistyksellä.
The people who fled the violence in their own countries, are now put up tienpätkälle telttansa and settled over an indefinite period between the two bodies in the country.
However, the frustration grew.
Police in a helicopter above them pysytellessä immigrants we were told repeatedly by the "Open the borders!" And a violation of huutelivat mellakkapoliisille in Hungary.
Some people refused to food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister, declared that it is "unacceptable" for a refund of migrants from Hungary, when they arrive in ever more from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause harm to civilians.
It must be held in the next few days with other countries and Brussels, "Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Chaos on the border between Hungary and Serbia was born after 28's nationality grouping failed riitaisassa creating a common immigration policy at a meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed on the division of responsibility when it comes to the 40 000 people seeking asylum, which are now occupied by Italy and Greece, the ministers raised the hopes of reaching a final agreement - in the next month or by the end of next year - about what the EU countries will take 120 000 lisäpakolaista, including part of Hungary.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded on Tuesday in the first week of an extraordinary EU summit to discuss the continent's migration crisis.
Hungary will not, however, do not hope that its neighbours or Brussels would act in the near future.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern region gave the authorities greater powers to act in a crisis, and it was possible that you can be shut down and the turvapaikkaoikeusjuttuja can be speeded up.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the border with Serbia is ready, the country is also going to erect barbed wire fence against Romania to establish its part in order to halt the influx of migrants through the country.
CBS correspondent Charlie D 'Agata Newsin reported that even the prisoners were being sent to finalise the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and saapumispaikka in the European Union for the refugees, many of whom are escaping war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed, however, that most of the incoming are economic migrants looking for a better life, and who are fleeing from the war, who are entitled to protection, this position is very much at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now defined as a crime or harm the company to exceed 4 metres (13 legs) barbed wire fence, which the government has built etelärajalle against Serbia, as well as provide a longer amend the convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by the massamaahanmuuton, the Hungarian government declared a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the city of Szeged in the south.
We are in fact very clear: The illegal border crossings is a crime.
Parliament must still formally approve the asemointi next week have been waiting for, but the Associated Press journalists on the border have seen in the early days, the heavily armed military personnel and koirineen ajoneuvoineen.
Orban domestic safety advisers Gyorgy Bakondi, said that the authorities had caught up with 45 people in their attempts to cross the border, as well as 15 ehtinyttä already further in the country.
They reached more than vahingoittamalla fence, are now in police vangitsemina, and they are accused of offences defined by the new laws.
The authorities will reap the wall quickly.
The Hungarian officials also shut down on Tuesday morning, two of the seven ylityspaikasta contrary to the Serbian border after they were sent by barbed wire plated glass junanvaunun to shut down one of those places.
Close to the Hungarian Roszkea Päärajanylityspaikka was veiled in chaos, when the Hungarians have opened a small office for the treatment of human beings, and no crowds metallikonttiin koittivat push inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands more were left out in the cold.
A group of migrants, blocked the päämoottoritien between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they are refusing food and drinking until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: According to a national poll, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sandersiin has narrowed in the side of the leadership
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue at the head of the Democrats nimityskisassa kaksinumeroisessa, but Senator Bernie Sanders kirii caught him.
Clinton now supports the 47 per cent of Democrat voters (dropped to 58 per cent), and a second Sandersia supports 27 per cent (increased by 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced the 40.5º presidenttikisaan, according to him, but he is in favour of a 15 per cent of Democrat voters.
For more than five months before the start of the vast majority of esivaalien demokraattiäänestäjistä says that it is still too early to say that they had decided who will vote.
Clinton's supporters are standing behind their own choice, however, more than the other kandidaattien supporters.
Clinton's popularity has fallen on several sections of the CBS News poll last month after the -kyselytutkimuksen, and at the same time, Sanders has risen to some degree.
Clinton is at the head of a couple of women and moderates, but his leadership has been narrowed.
His popularity among men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is just 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's head start in less than 50 years of age in demokraattiäänestäjien has disappeared, and he is now with the Sandersin figurines.
Clinton, however, clearly leads to the parents among the voters.
Last month, Clinton led the Sandersia tuplanumeroisella century on the Liberals, but now the Sanders to lead this team by five percentage points.
About half of the country's demokraattiäänestäjistä tells us that they are supporting Clinton enthusiastically, if he becomes the party's nominee.
A quarter said their support for him with reservations, and 15 per cent would support him just because he is the nominee.
The six per cent did not support him at all.
It is hardly surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be keen for his tukemisessaan.
Sekavampia opinions are those who are currently not in favour of Clinton - only a quarter of the support him enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of Democrats, voters say they would support Clinton supporter, Republican ykkösmiehestä Donald Trumpista same says fewer republikaaniäänestäjä (35 per cent).
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him as a candidate, the most popular answer was that he has the right experience (16 per cent), then the most popular answers were, that now is the right time for naispresidentille (13 per cent) and that he is the best candidate for the job (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his links with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
The same opinions, as well as the chance of being elected was also mentioned.
As the Vice President will affect the possible presidenttiehdokkuuteen, 57 per cent of demokraattiäänestäjistä would like to see him already involved in kisassa - even though a third of it is divided.
Demokraattiäänestäjiltä when asked who they would choose the second, the party's nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among the supporters of Clinton, more than half said that they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek the candidacy of the Democrats, Hilary Clinton's leadership Sandersista will grow, if Biden embraces, the leadership is 20 percentage points, but if he cut off, the figure is 30.
The 55 per cent of demokraattiäänestäjistä believes that it is the best chance to win the presidential election Clintonilla, but this figure has fallen from 78 per cent in the last month.
By this yardstick Biden falls short, but the percentage of those who see him äänestettävimpänä, has grown.
When demokraattiäänestäjiltä was asked what is the most important thing ehdokkaassa, however, they raised over äänestettävyyden opinions.
Nor does anyone in the last month, or possible kandidaattia demokraattikandidaattia was not considered as a candidate for the electorate.
The Democrats pre-ins or any pre-ins are doing well in certain key areas among the party's voters.
Most of the keep Clinton, Sandersia Bidenia as well as honest, trustworthy and strong leaders.
Biden is faring best kolmikosta honesty, while Clinton's strength is in the leadership.
Thirty per cent of the demokraattiäänestäjistä tells us that they do not like Clinton as an honest and trustworthy, which is two times more than the Sandersista (15 per cent), while 27 per cent said they have no opinion Sandersista.
Demokraattiäänestäjät also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically agree with.
When you look at all these issues, around a quarter of the demokraattiäänestäjistä tells us that they have no opinion Sandersista.
Even though Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and server when he was foreign minister raises more questions, most of the selitykseensä demokraattiäänestäjistä is happy with his score and says that it affected their yleismielipiteeseensä about him.
It is, however, a different, if you look at America as a whole.
Half of the American population is now dissatisfied with his selitykseensä, and only about a third of it is satisfied.
People's opinions were divided in March, shortly after it came to light.
The vast majority of Americans say that the Clintonista sähköpostipolemiikki affected their kokonaismielipiteeseensä, while 36 per cent say that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten republikaanista says that, in their opinion Clintonista has changed for the worse.
Even though Clinton's own party voters regard him as an honest and trustworthy, it is still a problem for him among all registered voters, only 32 per cent regarded him as an honest and trustworthy, and that figure has dropped to 8 percentage points over the past month, as well as 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that they do not like Clinton as an honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters in the country as a whole are also not Trumpia as an honest and trustworthy.
Both the Clinton and the Trumpia, however, is considered to be good leaders.
The study involved in the six kandidaatista Bidenia, rehellisimpinä Carsonia and Bush will be held.
As a rule, Sandersia is regarded as an honest broker, but many have no opinion of him, just as no Carsonistakaan.
The margin of error in the study, which was attended by 351 demokraattiäänestäjää, is 6 percentage points.
Approaching the Ben Carson, Donald Trumpia in a national survey
Ben Carson, Donald Trumpin will be close to the latest CBS News / New York Times survey
The two candidates collected in a new survey, half of all of the votes, leaving the others to fight for footing with.
Republikaaniäänestäjät throughout the country are still heavily Trumpia, whose popularity has risen in the last, before last month's Fox Newsin vaaliväittelyä on CBS's survey, 23% to 27% in a survey published on Tuesday.
Carson, however, has risen at the same time, soared from 6% to 23%.
Survey also found that Carson is doing well among different demographic groups, and it is supplanting the Trumpin republikaaniäänestäjien among university graduates.
The rest are being left behind, except Carly Fiorinaa and Ohio Governor John Kasichia. Wisconsinin Governor Scott Walkerin popularity has fallen the most: In the last month's 10 per cent of the current 2 per cent.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, as well as Florida Senator Marco Rubio are figurines in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for this latest, a survey conducted in September, 376 republikaaniäänestäjän otoksessa is + / - 6 per cent.
In the last week, published in the latest CNN / ORC's poll showed Carson's rise in the polls across European countries: She has a 19 percent support among Republicans, and Trump is his bit to 32 per cent.
Also in the latest ABC News / Washington Post survey Carsonia Trump was significantly ahead.
Carson's rise in popularity over the last week, the retired neurokirurgia Trump criticised in vain, even though the Carso Trumpin apologised for questioning the faith.
"We need energy," kampanjavierailullaan Iowassa Trump said last Saturday.
The five members of the correspondents are accused of Baruch College in the first year of the death of a student
Nearly two years after a student died in the Pocono Mountains region of simputusseremoniassa correspondents, the Governor of Pennsylvania, murhasyyte has been brought against the five people.
At Baruch College in New York City in -yliopiston Pi Delta PSI -veljeskunnan Members were cruelly chun "Michael" Dengin jäsenyysriitin attack in September 2013, during, and after that were late with their transposition of his hospital viemisessään, thus myötävaikuttaen his death, police said.
The authorities say that, in the eyes of Dengin were committed and the backs of his rucksack with kiloinen kuormattiin for more than 13 years full of sand, after which he repeatedly taklattiin in the country when he was trying to walk through the pellon jäisen towards the finishing line.
Eventually, Deng complained that he thought it could happen, after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the correspondents have been sounding dial Dengin pyörryttyä, but according to the accusations were waiting for an hour before they brought him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had the time to swap Dengin clothes, search online for information about his oireistaan, as well as contacting the national president of the correspondents Andy Mengiin asking in this advice, the chief of police, Chris Wagner, told a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to bury rituaalivarusteitaan and thus effectively placed above the welfare of correspondents Michael Dengin," Wagner said the chief of police.
Virkoamaan Dengiä did not, and he died the next morning.
According to the Ruumiinavauspöytäkirjan Deng received repeated tylpän object attacks in the head, body and reisiin.
"Too many families have suffered veljeskuntasimputuksesta, when every year for at least one student has died as a result of its ever since 1970," Doug Fierberg, Dengin, a lawyer representing the family, said in a statement.
Veljeskunnat and their members need to be held accountable, and this is an important step for the authorities.
Monroe District grand jury voted in favour of the fact that the first five members will receive the charges for the murder of tertiary
Members of the 32 other correspondents, including Meng, will also be charged with a violent simputtamisesta, as well as the criminal intrigues.
"We do not want to be held accountable only to individuals, and if there is any organisation behind the crash, which was approved by the situation, either formally or informally, they will also be held to account," Wagner said in a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the correspondents and the National Order abolished its links with paikallisosastoon.
What happens when the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in
Interest rates will rise, and emerging markets to fall into the abyss, bond yields are rising and the economy falls into recession.
This we know.
What we do not know is how long all this will go, or how long it will last.
History does not provide assistance on the timing, particularly when it comes to the economy.
The arrival of the recession has taken its first after the peat, sometimes in just 11 months, sometimes, meanwhile, has gone as long as 86 months.
The US Federal Reserve interest rate nostossa aggression has been often, though not always, the defining factor in how the economy and the financial resources to react.
Therefore, the US Federal Reserve officials are so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on that, because interest rates are starting to raise, but mainly to normalisation kehityskaareen to go along.
In an equation is indeed a number of variables.
In the end, however, market participants will be able to see that all the koronnostoon method has been inflated.
"The Federal Reserve, the first increase after the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles, the" cheap money "päättymiseksi era," said Capital Economics global affairs päätalousasiantuntija Julian Jessop message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect that US interest rates vary by a gradual return to normal, although still low, the level is such a seminal shock, which many people seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that it would have consequences.
Below is a summary of how some sectors of the economy will behave on the basis of a previous development:
As we have seen in the market during the last for about a month, waiting for the peat interest rates can make the situation unstable.
While the increase will become a reality, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a tendency to dwell on capital in 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which in turn may reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study, about what will happen after the increase in the central bank.
More specifically, the last for about 35 years, the markets are generally strong, approximately 14% on the rise with the approach of the increase, 250 days after that, the situation is fairly steady rise in average (2.6 per cent), and there have been 500 days after normaalitila average returns in six in the last cycle of 14.4 per cent, highlighting the Nuveen asset Management -firman leading pääomastrategin Bob Dollin in a recent analysis, which was published in Barron's journal.
According to Deutsche Bank, impact on equities is usually clearer korotussyklin at a later stage, when the yields are starting to fall.
Regressions are part of the economy, but the korkonostot often contribute to their arrival.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing a number of challenges that would not have been in the past, and that could boost the recession.
This is especially the gross domestic product, which will be the closest to its level matalinta ever before an increase in the central bank.
According to the Deutsche Bank in the years after the 1950 118 nostossa nominal annual GDP has only twice been less than 4.5 per cent.
Even though the 2015 second neljänneksenä figure was 3.6 per cent, few people believe that permanent, while the third quarter has moved to 1.5 per cent, says the federal varantopankki in Atlanta.
In such a fragile talousasetelmassa interest rates can be risky and raises the question, "Is this a different time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants are prepared for an increase in the central bank throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee -komitean, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the committee can accept an increase in this meeting, the futures trading suggests that only 25 per cent more likely.
"Our research shows that since 1950 onwards, all korotussyklit have so far been featuring in the growing leverage supersykleissä, where GDP has surpassed the previous peak in the recession very soon after the recovery has begun," the report says.
On the other hand, now under way, has been exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst havaintokauden.
Nykysyklissä Central Bank has been by far the longest since the end of the last recession: There have been a record 35 months, and now under way is already 74. a month.
The fixed returns have also been volatile, while waiting for an increase in the market, and the model is somewhat reminiscent of the findings of the capital.
Pääero is that the central bank moves its line, its effects will be felt more quickly than engineered debit cards.
Bonds yields an immediate change in direction seems to be the first increase in the cycle / for the surgery.
At the end of the Korotussyklin bonds yields will fall immediately, "Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab -strategit believes that the rise in interest rates will cause the convergence of pidempi- and lyhyempiaikaisten bonds yields, thus tasoittaen tuottokäyrää.
Korkeatuottoiset bonds are often better in that situation, even though "we are still cautious when it comes to the search for yield," said Schwab, a fixed return on the analyst Kathy Jones in the analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the markets are already adapted to the Central Bank linjausodotuksiin.
"The strength of the dollar and a drop in inflation expectations, there are a number of signs that the markets are adapted to the prospects for tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
In the short term interest rates are high, tuottokäyrä is even more balanced, luottomarginaalit have grown and the instability has grown - all these are specific to the market at a time when the Federal Reserve has tightened up the line.
In general, the companies whose business is largely in the United States, will win, when interest rates are rising and the local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies, which have a lot of debt, will fare less well, while the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on world markets and the debt will become more expensive than what they have the funding.
"History shows that the" quality "of the shares, which are usually more lucrative interest rate increases in the first three months," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
The companies, which have a strong turnover, passed a weak turnover companies in 1994, 1999 and 2004, after increases by an average of 5 per cent.
The companies, which have a high return on capital and the shares of low volatility, done better than matalampilaatuiset businesses, the former average was 4 (percentage points) and the latter 3 (percentage points).
The debt is going to be a big problem.
The companies that have a lot of vaihtuvakorkoista debt, are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside the speculative consumers will have the opportunity to benefit from the rise in the value of the dollar.
Also, savers will be able to make a profit with higher profits, even though experts are divided about how quickly the impact is being felt.
The BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Andrew Bingham Konservatiivikansanedustaja accuses the channel "kansantajuistamisesta"
He argues that the separation of the commercial feels will become increasingly difficult
In addition, he was attacking the BBC Music Awards -palkinnot, saying that they only emulate the Brit Awards -palkintoja
Kansanedustajakollega Damien Collins criticised The Voicea, saying that it is not an original
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" Classic FM, says a leading MP tuotantoyhtiön adding pressure to prove that it is doing something, what the commercial tuotantoyhtiöt will not do.
Konservatiivikansanedustaja Andrew Bingham said the BBC managers, too, that the public service radio station played "kansantajuistavan" make-up, and that it is becoming more and more difficult to distinguish from the commercial feels.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I would like to use the term" to popularise the sites "- is becoming Classic FM to Y," he said.
He was also being bombarded by the BBC Music Awards -palkintogaalan, which launched last December.
"In the last year, started the BBC Music Awards will affect only under a different name in the organised -gaalalta Brit Awards.
So therefore, if you are trying to do something different, there are two straight muistamaani examples when, in fact, only kopioitte something that already exists in the market, "Bingham said.
The BBC's Director General has denied the accusations, claiming that the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of the commercial kilpakumppaniaan regarding livemusiikkiin and the sharing of information to the public.
Radio 3 to teach such things in the world of classical music, what I can learn from anywhere else.
In its commitment to the lively music and musisointiin is actually the first rate.
"But I think it is really important that Radio 3 has committed to finding new music and to commission new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3's head, Alan Davey, argued that the channel will have to do more work than in the past, reaching out to the public, because the British people know less classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only part of the BBC's supply, which was criticised on the toes of commercial competitors luck for culture, media and urheiluerityisvaliokunnan during the hearing.
The Tory Party, the Conservative MP Damien Collins criticised The Voicea, musiikkikilpailua, in which the BBC was bought by a Dutch tuotantoyhtiöltä Talpa made £22 million, according to estimates.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed, because it is not the original and does not in any way pivotal?
Lord Hall said that this channel on the BBC1 programme, which operates tähtituomareina Paloma Faith and Boy George, has produced a "very BBC style."
He added that he wants to "find tuotantoyhtiön success from inside his own house," the next time it will start viihdesarjan.
He did not, however, refused to stop the next generation of The Voice -kausien, or to the fact that the money would be spent on other viihdeformaatteihin luvanmaksajien.

The department said that a total of 394 people were injured as well, when you fell down
29 dead being carried through the streets in the air, when hundreds of Muslims rallied to bury them, the victims were killed when you collapsed in the Mecca suurmoskeijassa.
Predominantly white uniformed surijat fulfilled the route to commemorate the dead, who made his last trip to Al-Moaissemin graveyard.
A sad procession proceeded to the holy place where just a few days ago, you fell through the roof of the mosque and brought down palvojia.
Maybe it would go into Jenin was released, when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family rakennuskonsernin guilty of the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
The Mecca suurmoskeijassa collapsed killing nostokurjen palvojista 29's corpses being carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children from Qasim Akram holidaymakers driving from Bolton, Manchester, and he was the first pyhiinvaelluksellaan when you collapsed.
Akram had been suurmoskeijassa with his parents before the start of the annual pilgrimage, the Hajj was killed.
Saudiviranomaiset have already sworn that the Hajj was killed Mekkaan will continue, as thousands continued to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group, should not have been left along nosturin up when it was not in use.
Led by the state Saudi Press published by Agencyn arabiankielisessä version of the decision, it was said that the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the breakdown.

B & Q boss says that eastern Europeans are behind the popularity of työmiehet working on the cheap
The British people are using more and more apumiesten fencing, Veronique Laury says
The number of skilled workers coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result of the ammattimiehille oriented Screwfix shops opened up to 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher turns 60 B & Q shops across the country
The writer Rupert Steiner, the city's pääkirjeenvaihtaja -lehdelle Daily Mail
The British are said to renounce vasaroista and maalipensseleistään with rather adept at työmiehiä from Eastern Europe to kodinkunnostustöitä
It seems to me that if you're a handy with a hammer or haka maalaamaan walls, you're now in the minority.
Indeed, the British had to hire more and more apumiehiä to manage the do-it-yourself work in their homes, says B & Q's underlying the company's boss.
Kodinremonttikauppaketjun Kingfisherin owns a new CEO Veronique Laury said that it is behind the popularity of Eastern Europe, the number of skilled työmiesten hotline and the fact that they are offering their services on the cheap.
As a result, the Kingfisher is planning to make 200 new työmiehille directed the Screwfix trade and the closure of 60 B & Q shops.
Laury said that he wants more women to work in the B & Q stores, because eight out of ten for the ostopäätöksestä shop is actually a nicer by sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that among the changes that must be taken into account: Today, there is more to the economies of one woman, which makes the kodinkunnostustöitä more than in the past.
Laury said: "The vast majority of the staff is still myymälöidemme men.
We need to look for a better balance.
There is, however, half of the asiakkaistamme women, and 80 per cent of the ostopäätöksistä products are made by women.
Women have a big role in the decision making process. "
Laury is one of only five women who run Britain's most important companies in the FTSE100 index, he has built up a johtoryhmänsä again in such a way that it is as much a male and naisesimiehiä.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that is exactly 50 per cent of the women in the group, including its president, as well as rahoitusjohtaja.
Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - the difference here is an important thing.
There has not been hard to find a good johtoryhmään women. "
Kingfisher announced the bill, as well as the sale of tuotoissa six months after the group took the blame for the costs of closing shops.
As a result of the trend the Screwfix- and B & Q shops is a Kingfisher is opening up to 200 new movement
Three ässän, the government decided to resort to the pressing legislation in order to save the country's economy.
Visible effects in the forthcoming pretty quickly.
SAK's and other palkansaajakeskusjärjestöjen sharp head began to force straight away and, as a result, the country stands on Friday because of the broad mielenilmauksen workers.
Many people believe that the time is also sense at that time.
Asked whether to strike, while the rest will go badly.
There is even a vastarintaliikekin set up.
On the Net, more than 50 000 people have already been to announce that he will take part in the protest, but goes to work.
The old good konsensusaikaan like this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no nettiä, where the protest, but openly rikkuriksi's would have been a small man's political suicide.
Miljoonajäsenisiä unions a couple of ten thousand people in the imposition of the protest is not much, but it will give pause for thought.
Role of the trade union movement is no longer so obvious than it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the ownership of the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the perspective of the trade union movement's activities there are the government's drastic solutions may also be seen as a gift of a sky.
When things are shown rullaavan for years by its own momentum, so now, at long last, these alliances will be involved, in other words, to defend the rights of the worker, visibly and properly.
The government may thus tahtomaan perhaps a stronger role of the trade union movement, when the trade union membership will be seen, perhaps, it is more necessary than in the past.
There are organisations in the action, so it is nonsense to say that Friday's demonstration does somehow halt in Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to fall, and the unemployment rate will rise.
All of these things, you would think the pressing head.

Mississippi Gautierin police officer told me that the Delta State Universityn geography and social sciences teacher Lamb phoned the emergency number approximately at 10 o'clock in the morning
On Monday, and said that he was shot and killed someone.

The stars, who lost charming
Näyttelijällä (on the left), the picture of his son with Redmondin (right), has been hard hit in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered from leukaemia, and in 2009, his long term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.

A Manchester United Luke Shaw is out for months due to the kaksoismurtuman
Luke Shaw received kaksoismurtuman in the right foot PSV Eindhovenille hävitessä Manchester United in the Champions "League match.
Even though the defender was left in tears and will be out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw would get to play again this season.
This reckless injury was caused by Héctor Moreno taklaus on 15 minutes after a 20-year old Shaw was headed straight for PSV's territory.
He was dealt with 9 minutes on the pitch, and he had to give oxygen before going to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He is kaksoismurtuma and he is now in the hospital."
Maybe she will be transferred tomorrow or the day after that, and then cut in Manchester.
This is awful, the boy will become Manchester Unitediin at the age of 18, suffers from the difficulties and after playing brilliantly, and is now engaged in the case.
When I was in the pukuhuoneessa, he was happinaamari spot.
He crying.
I am not a doctor, but the kaksoismurtuma will take at least six months, and he is playing lohkovaiheessa.
I hope that he will get to play in this period.
Moreno onnekkaalta appeared when he received, or a red card and rangaistuslaukauksen.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli was not punished Mexican players.
Van Gaal has suggested that the Italian toimitsija was wrong.
You can denounce the situation itself, when I say that it became a rangaistuslaukaus and a red card.
It was a really bad two foot taklaus.
Shaw twiittasi as follows: "Thank you to all the viesteistänne, words are not enough to explain how disappointed I am, toipumiseni begins now, I will come back stronger."

British puolustajalla is a further incentive to recovery in next June's European Championship in France.
PSV's manager Phillip Cocu said: "It is really a bad disability."
If a player is forced out because of this type of injury, are all very sad.
Pelaajiemme never intended to offend an adversary.
Moreno leg fell, when he played against the Mexican team Van Gaalin Holland of the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno will take this hard, because it is not a hurtful opponent, and when you hear that disability is really bad, it is a bad thing," Cocu said.
I have seen in that situation.
The only thing that I saw was the ball, which was moving in a different direction, so it seemed like he [Moreno] would be unaffected by this, but I did not see Luken taklausta.
Moreno said the SBS6 level: "I know what it is, I know how difficult this kind of thing can be.
Because of this, I feel safer launch, I am so sorry. "
PSV's Andrés Guardado was taken to the hospital, Chris Smallingin can challenge him.
I suppose David Cameron knows this better than Loraxin?
Every parent learns about one thing: If your child loves something in the book, it does not take long before it learns almost from the outside.
So, if you're David Cameron. "
When the holiday period, providing childcare service, asked the Prime Minister for his suosikkilastenkirjaansa, he chose the 'Dr am Seussin The Lorax, published in 1971, say the story.
It was a tough choice, Cameron writes a message to the company's website, published SuperCamps and continues: "A funny, poignant, creative and contains a strong message and I enjoyed my children when I read this book, because it always seems to find the image or message that we have not seen in the past."
All of this is true, but the next chapter, in which Mr Cameron is expected to portray the juonen book, is a summary of the 2012 elokuvaversiosta, in which a relatively short paragraphs which they are written was added to the new characters and details.
"Within the walls of the city of Tarvillen, where all the nature has been lost, and even the air is a commodity, the son of Ted is hoping to win over the girl's dreams of winning the heart by filling Audreyn desire to see a real tree," the text says, and describes the love story - it died in 1991 by Dr Seuss, from the right, called Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not yet sufficiently suspicious, Cameron sounds in some places than it would have been an Internet database Movie -verkkosivulta löytyvästä Lorax juonitiivistelmästä in the film, which begins as follows: "The Tarvillen within the walls of the city, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, the son of Ted in the hopes of winning Audrey dreams to win over the girl's heart."
Given that Cameron has publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would have to drink so perehtymätön book, in which a young, anonymous boy hears how the local wildlife has destroyed the greedy, trees hakkaava and tarviksia kutova Kerskanen, regardless of the short story to name antaneesta, viiksekkäästä oliosta Loraxista, which "speaks on behalf of the trees."
Such a relatively invisible PR task has probably been outsourced avustajalle, which does not appear to have never read the book 20 times in a row for the child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said that the text will become Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was Cameron's staff, but would not comment about it at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being marginalized in the England team, but it was still a hard place
Playing against Pakistan Arabiemiirikunnissa is a hard task, but when you see what kind of team England have chosen kiertueelle, I do not believe that a repeat of the last 3-0 sarjahäviön is likely.
I would not rule vierasvoittoakaan out of the equation.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but it is involved in a good kierrelyöjiä and the philosophy of the team is strong: They have no scars from 2012, only nuorekasta positiivisuutta.
Moeen Ali will develop kierresyötöissään and Adil Rashid is hyökkääjävaihtoehto, although it is unknown at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth GNI krikettijoukkueesta of England, he will be replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave a team of Adam Lyth is understandably difficult to analyse for me, because I am his päävalmentajansa in Yorkshire.
In his seven games have been good against the aggressors in the challenging circumstances, and simple, but the harsh reality is that, on the basis of kriketinpelaajia is criticised for its performance.
The choice of Joe Rootin, for example, there was no uncertainty before the briefing note, because, as I have said before, the players are the best choice of the factors.
About 100 percentage points more, and the period of Lythin team had been able to continue, but he was in charge of their own destiny.
Hopefully, if he gets more juoksuja ensured, another opportunity will come.
The England päävalmentaja Lythin executive Trevor Bayliss praised the attitude, even when he is not performing quite as well as we could have, and it does not surprise me, Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long lyöjä gets a trail of the perpetrators.
Maajoukkueeseen Lyth was selected seven times, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected yhdeksästi.
Compton only got the chance to play at home, as well as the other.
The only complaint is the fact that England chose Jonathan Trottin first in the Caribbean, when Lyth was on top form, but it missed the opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and it is the lyöjä which I appreciate.
He has the kriketinpelaajana is something that we in Yorkshire we saw early in this season, when he made 236 points against us in the Trent Bridgen on the ground.
At the very least, he must be given the same opportunity as others before him, but that of course depends on the composition of the team in the United Arabiemiirikunnissa.
The idea has shuttled Moeenista lyöntiavauksessa Cook's side, when on the ground to get an extra syöttäjä but can be kept four quick, and I am not against this.
I do not understand why lyöjä might be able to beat it, and it has already shown himself to be quite a vasenkätinen kriketinpelaaja.
Moeen is not necessarily done my kreivikunnassaan role, but he is kolmonen for them, and it is not much of a difference.
The old joukkuekaverini Justin Langers played the first 38 games in the first hilan fell, before avaukseen moved in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred points or muistellut in the past.
Zafar Ansari will see varasyöttäjäksi, and, in a bit of what I have been in contact with him, he seems to be a very impressive a young man.
People can look to slam his kaunistelemattomia statistics - an average of 31, with the ball 35 - and think that it is a gamble, but there are not too many syöttäjiä and voters opted for young people.
He will learn a lot in this kiertueella.
Outside the team from England would seem to be a few tough rider valmentajapuolelle.
The appointment of the lyöjän Mahela Jayawardenen srilankalaisen konsultiksi games may turn out to be neronleimaukseksi.
He is one of the kavereista mukavimmista game, and will bring a huge amount of experience, because we have done anything at all times and in all kinds of attacks.
According to Paul Collingwood will be the white ball games, and brings with it, as well as the energy and ruthless streak.
I have always thought that he was born in order to be involved in the international kriketissä, whether it be gambling or valmentamista, and he has the same älliä than Mahelalla to be exploited.
Sometimes, the new voices pukuhuoneessa to freshen up the team, even if their message is the same as in the past.
Collyn joukkuekaveria Durhamista, Ben Stokesia, lepuutetaan yksipäiväisissä, Rootille was given a similar break against Australia, and I certainly have no problem with that.
Although not everyone would agree with that, sports coaches and opted for no timetables.
And we must remember that, just like the players, will depend on the results of their work.
Such decisions are never take lightly.
The departure of Britain from the EU (Brexit) will support can take the victory, if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-hearted uudelleenneuvottelustrategiat to keep Britain in the EU will face even greater problems for the day, but at least my heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbynin choice to lead the Labour Party or the trade unions' suuttumisesta to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners, too, have their own Corbyninsa and Nigel Faragensa.
The European diplomaattikaveri recently explained that, because the EU is so deep in a variety of crises, all of which are not of its own fault, some Member States are tired of the British itsekeskeiseen agenda, which is full of friction causing concessions and disruptive amendments, which for the most part, these countries do not want.
In its annual meeting in Brighton trade union Confederation decided that it does not want them, if they undermine the social protection.
We could even call it Daven and Georgen selfieagendaksi.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer myöhästelevät summits or in foreign capitals, there will be bilateral meetings, take a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, either with or without the local silmäätekevän him, and then come home, saying that will win support for the reforms.
I think it is all about.
European kaverini, which wants the outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Do not leave us alone with the French," Berlin says, suggests that certain capitals lyhytnäköisimmät ministers and officials are now in a stage where they do not, then we will leave.
Germany's cautious and prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave their efforts before they spoil in the same way as it became too long viipyneille Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohlille (16).
In the face of France's François Hollandella is the horizon or be replaced in 2017.
He, too, is the strength of häipyvä.
Poland may soon be a nationalistic conservative government, the Spanish leftist.
It is difficult to see these countries on behalf of selfiebrittien uhrautumassa, when their energies would be better directed at the prevention of the fact that Scotland will leave the United Kingdom - they do not want anything similar due to their own separatistisuuntausten.
So, my friend put it, some of these ministers can even design deliberately pointless comments made in the style of the Scottish National Party in Britain during the course of the year 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the process of the Brexit.
"Uudelleenneuvottelut was organised in the story" and "Uudelleenneuvotteluilla did not have any significance in the United Kingdom."
The Europeans have become painfully aware of how ahnas Fleet Street thing can be, and how the EU-sceptical press yksinvaltiaat are, what they were not Tony Benn inspiroiman referendum in 1975 at a time when our membership began in 1973, received the confirmation of suhdeluvulla 2: 1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest of the Euro-opportunistin, who made a name for itself by writing, "the EU's direct bananas" when he was a correspondent for Brussels in the early 1990s.
DE Miliband was perhaps a silly, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They belonged to a plethora of taxes vierastavia veijareita, telephones hakkeroivia foreigners, as well as individuals, whose head office is nominally elsewhere and who devote most of their big sanomalehdistämme.
In fact, Tony Blair was thinking of them just the same, but realised that if you are in a cage with himokkaan gorillan, the bananas will have to be abandoned due to the mystification drawn over, unless you want to be the gorillan lounaslistalla and later over dinner.
In fact, Miliband was blairilaisempi than Blair himself, when it comes to combating uudelleenneuvottelutempun Cameron, Bair had agreed to the principle of the EU, behind the rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press did not give him that either never forgive me.
But a nice Jeremy Corbyn, who applauded me gently in the back in the Westminster parlamenttitalolla on Monday (I told him that he does not have any time to lose me), it would seem likely to play again in the 1980s Neil Kinnock boikotoidaan Murdochia strategy, which was a mistake, then and now.
Even though it may take some time, however, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but no doubt Andrew Marriin, which the BBC sohvalta Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbynin official status in Europe is, to put it mildly, evolving.
He says that the renewed would like us to stay in the EU.
Well, most of the people of the United Kingdom Independence Party UKIP sotamaali intoilun, as well as the Conservative Party's hurjimpien outside the nationalists can certainly stand behind this opinion.
"Hilary Benn, but not in the Benn fan trying," Benn said that, as well as radio and television celebrity this week when his inner partiolaisensa would be unwilling to admit that the choice to appoint karski Corbynin John McDonnell varjohallituksen acknowledged it was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the chapters in the 1970s, when his isäpappansa pinnisteli TV: Celebrity trying to be disloyal towards hallituskollegoitaan Labour, without that, however, would not go so far as to lose hallituspaikkansa.
Hilaryn pinnistelyt were more attractive.
But on behalf of the battle that is involved in the "anywhere" - Benn utterance - was not what McDonnell said, and by all accounts what Corbyn told pääreille and councillors in a private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever may be the epähierarkkinen, emotional and personal image, which Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even referred to me), the communications discipline is important ympärivuorokautisen TV era, and especially in the forefront of social media, which is a good breeding ground for vainoharhoille and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair to give Cameronille ilmaislippua in Europe by allowing her to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins, at least, thinks so.
But McDonnellin and Corbynin peruskiertely on membership of the EU (and therefore in line with their Benn-strong supporters of its economy, and with its past antikapitalistisen) is no longer just a abstruse debate on a series of vasemmistotoisinajattelijoiden, for whom the small differences opillisissa nahisteluissa narsismi is a central dogma.
As far as his relationship with NATO kaksijakoisuuteensa (Tom Watson is convinced that the Corby siitäm campaigned, and hand over), ulkomaalaisdiplomaattien should only try to explain it to their superiors -.
Why the Paris or Berlin would be well advised to spend political capital (they too have a sceptical electorate) concessions to Britain, where it can be completely pointless?
The United States has been somewhat disappointed by the lack of British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even at the cost of mowing under a Conservative government in power, as we were reminded me in Monday's British influence Security Forum -turvallisuusfoorumin aloituksessa.

Scientists have said that the state-funded agency's assertion that the sähkötupakat are 95 per cent less harmful than conventional, was inspired by the spirit of the 12 meetings, which was part of the links to the tobacco industry.
The British Medical Journaliin (BMJ) write experts joined Lancetiin criticise Public Health Englandin (PHE) sähkötupakasta used by the evidence in their report.
PHE published this "milestone" in the last month, -raporttinsa kuvaten it "into a comprehensive katsaukseksi empirical evidence."
Many scientists, however, have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical aikakausjulkaisu editorials in The Lancet, published last month, which attacked the PHE's main "exceptionally warn against the bottom.
The other two BMJ: Celebrity kirjoittanutta scientists have pondered whether the allegations are "built kalliolle or on sand."
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine -koulun European Public Health, Professor Martin McKee, as well as the University of Liverpool, a professor of clinical epidemiology Simon Capewell said: "The main principle of public health is that the effectiveness of the operations should establish todistetulle."
They say that the public expects that the PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that the sähkötupakat are around 95 per cent less harmful than traditional tupakat" is based on a detailed assessment of the evidence and multimodal model.
In reality, it will be one of the 12 in the spirit of the meeting, which was developed in syntetisoimaan monikriteeripäätösanalyysimalli (MCDA) for their opinion on the disadvantages, which is associated with a range of products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting was reduced to research.
McKee and Capewell will say that one of the meeting was the company nimelä sponsoreista EuroSwiss Health, whose president is reported in the past have received funding from the Bristish American Tobacco company for independent research.
He also supported the BAT: In kansanterveysvaltuuksia kestävyysraportissa, they say.
One of the 12 people in the meeting, announced that it has received funding from the manufacturer sähkötupakan, but not for the funding, which he won earlier in the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The selection of members of the panel are not being told, but the panel is one of a number of notorious sähkötupakan supporters, some of whom also indicate the study that it has received funding from the area.
The others who were there are not known for their asiantuntijuudestaan tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tupakkajohtaja.
The study produced by the group "tantamount to admit" that there is a lack of "undoubted documentary evidence regarding the disadvantages in most of our products, and in most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
None of these connections or limitations, however, did not mention the PHE's report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "so far there is no evidence that the children of the incineration sähkötupakka operates route or non-tupakoitsijoilla" appear to be premature.
PHE's director of health and wellbeing, Professor Kevin Fenton says that the BMJ: Celebrity statements have been answered in the past.
He says: "The Sähkötupakat are considerably less harmful than burning."
Half of the lifelong polttaneista riippuvuuteensa die.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks caused by sähkötupakan are relatively small, but we need to continue to explore the effects of the long term.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence looks like and what it does not seem to be, especially when compared with the relative risks of tobacco is so much public epätietoutta.
Nearly 80 000 people die each year from smoking related disease and smoking costs the NHS for £2 billion per year.
By explaining the current evidence - in other words, even though sähkötupakat are not risk free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the traditional tobacco disadvantages - we are fulfilling a national responsibility.
The BBC would do well to abandon the EastEndersistä, says the former Channel 4 -johtaja
The former Channel 4 -puheenjohtaja Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice to be deployed, and that the commercial competitors "would give anything" from hiteistä than, for example, that Albert Square 8 sijoittuvasta saga.
Johnson said that the licence fees should only be used for making such programmes, which other British broadcasters are not doing.
He criticised the BBC for the fact that it puts the public service programs, which is likely to have a smaller audience, the vexed lähetysaikoihin katsotuimpia competitors against the programmes and channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall said the company wants to do more to cooperate with other organisations, Johnson said that he was Channel 4's back six years to create a relationship with the BBC, to no avail.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC will produce and send the programs, which would be clearly subventoimattomille competitors," Johnson said in the House of Lords viestintäkomitealle as part of its inquiry into the BBC's future.
If lupamaksusta is maintained - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for viestimelle or in the long term, it should at least to limit their output to programmes that others do not make and produce.
The Voicea will be sent to the main prime transmission time, because in the future is to gather as much support as possible.
The idea that no one else would look like a program, it is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why the regressiivisen tax should fund the programs, which also could be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one of the EastEnders and the second, admittedly carried out inside the house.
Quite frankly, the other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand what it is all about public service broadcast acknowledging.
I do not believe that it would weaken the BBC at all. "
Channel 4: Testimony from 2004 to 2010, resulted in sarjayrittäjä Johnson has said that the BBC is guilty of katsojamäärien hunting "because of the objectives of the people who work there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long term support."
In his comments to the BBC's most popular are reminiscent of a former Sky boss Tony Ballin comments, he used the MacTaggart luentonsa in Edinburgh in 2003 in order to propose that the BBC sell sarjat such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's public service programmes in a smaller audience, "goes to the BBC4, which often katsojamäärää cannot be measured, but the BBC meets in their portfolios and can then lupamaksutuloja £4 billion in the defence of hypocrisy, saying that" of course, we are doing all these unknown programs, which no one will see. ""
They put them in the lähetyspaikalle, in which no one is ever going to watch them.
Regarding the lupamaksua Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find regressiivisemmän in the system, who can get the most value for money.
Of course, you all think we all think that the £150 a year will get a lot of value for money, but I don't know whether they are true to the people for whom the £150 is a big money, because they do not use the BBC too much.
The former Sky, and the closure of Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should revise its Reithin early to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said that only a small part of the BBC's output is classified as training today - he said the figures to be 1 per cent of the TV production and 0.1 per cent on the radio - and that it should follow the example of Australia and Canada in the form of yleisradioilta and change the task to "inform, educate and entertain."
As far as the kumppanuuskysymyksiin, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as the Proms concerts, which he said are shown on television, have just a few, and aligned with the commercial companies in such a way that all of these would be accessible on the web.
"Äänigenetiikka" will allow the management of aivosolujen through ääniaaltojen
Video shows how sukkulamadot changing direction as soon as the voice of the momentum has hit them.
The researchers have fuelled the worms, which are genetically muokatut hermojärjestelmät, so that they can manipulate ääniaaltopurkauksilla.
Tiny brains sukkulamadot changing direction as soon as they are victims of the voice of the momentum, which is too high before ihmiskorvin.
The impetus will operate on the purchasers of genetically muokatut liikehermosolut, where kalvokanavat ultraääniaaltoihin have reacted.

The researchers said that the new madot show, äänigenetiikaksi named, the functioning of the method, which can be used to activate certain brain ultraääntä, cardiovascular disease and lihassoluja from outside the body.
The Salk Institute in California, La Jollassa scientist Sreekanth Chalasani told The Guardianille that the method could one day replace syväaivostimulaation; it is a invasiivinen measure, in which the human brain will be electric to treat Parkinson's disease.
Ultraääneen Sukkulamadot do not normally react, but Chalasani found that, when they are surrounded by a liquid, which is mikroskooppisen small bubbles, the situation changed.
He found that the bubbles confirmed ultraääniaaltoja, who then go inside matojen.
The confirmed ultraääniaallot appear at the 4-ionikanaviin, structures, which have some of the solukalvoissa matojen.
Ionikanavat ääniaallot will get them to open up and to activate them pinned on cells, is reported in Nature Communications in a report published in the magazine.
In order to prepare ultraäänellä governed sukkulamatoja, Chalasani adapted worms genetically modified so that their liikehermosoluja is part of the Transnational Radical 4-ionikanavat.
When Chalasani used the ultraääntä muokattuihin matoihin, mikrokuplat matoihin ääniaaltoja confirmed and sent them, where they form the link between liikehermosolut muokatut appearance.
The method has some of the same traits as optogenetiikassa, the pioneering työkalussa, which will give scientists the opportunity to connect on a nerve and switched off by using the valoimpulsseja.
Chalasani said, however, that there may be some benefits to the sonogenetiikan optogenetiikkaan.
In contrast to the light, which must be sent to the optical kuitua along the desired point within the brain, matalataajuuksiset ultraääniaallot can travel unhindered through the fabric, so that they can be sent to the brain kallon locally.
"We believe that, through the use of gene therapy and the therapeutic virus, it may be possible to get the man's ilia ultraäänisignaaliin momentarily to react in certain neurological treatments in clinical environments," Chalasani said.
The other sovelluskohteet would be able to focus on lihassoluihin and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Foreign students in a racist attack in majapaikkaan Kiteellä - töhrittiin Salossa Vastaanottokeskukseksi planned house
Ulkomaalaisopiskelijoiden majapaikkaan was made on Saturday in the small hours of racist attack in Kiteellä in North Karelia.
Unlike in the past, the police said, it is no longer concerned with living quarters, but already in the minors who were in Finland ulkomaalaisopiskelijoiden nukkumatilat, Kiteen Evangelical kansanopiston teacher Heidi Luukkainen said.
Kansanopiston majoitustilojen windows and walls töhrittiin rasistisilla labels, such as hakaristeillä, and had been thrown through the window of one majoitustilan metallic objects, tells in eastern Finland's police officer.
The education of the young yhteiskuntatakuu Kansanopiston vastuuopettajana Luukkaisen operating under hooliganism, according to the building was estimated to be about 10 people in the attack.
"It was a weekend and the adults, people are free to move around, so part of it could be elsewhere," Luukkainen said.
Kansanopistolla is majoittuneena people from 12 different nationalities.
They are the students who were already in Finland for some time, as well as the only migrant minors asylum seekers.
In all the sotketussa building is A statukset.
Part of the corresponding aikuisperuskoulussa, part of it is professional in their education and part of the Finnish study, "Luukkainen says.
The status of the A, is known as a permanent residence permit, which can be granted for four years in a row in Finland for some time has been foreign.

The state to abolish the Y Karjaalle train, the passengers feel upset, "absolutely idiotic"
Helsinki Raaseporin Karjaalle fodder Y-train stops from passing in March.
News for the people of the train passengers in the emerging alkuiltavuoroon päärautatieasemalla in Helsinki.
In particular, the decline hits siuntiolaisiin, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
Absolutely idiotic, because the population is growing all the time, and who are in need of a quick and smooth link to Helsinki.
This cannot be anything other than the political will to maintain - or the lack of it.
HSTV Bengtström says he's visiting a haastatteluvideolla even though tractors after only the capital city.
Also in the rest of Uudellamaalla junamuutoksia is happening.
The H- Pääradalla pass and R trains will combine into a new R-effort.
Role of Purolan Järvenpäässä and Nuppulinna Tuusulassa will remain out of use.
The Committee on Transport and the Ministry of Communications and the VR issued on Tuesday, the information about how the reiteiltä ministry to buy rail traffic in the next period.
This agreement will change is the turn of the year and lakkautettavia routes throughout the country.
In the autumn, a new four-year contract viimeisteltävän will adopt later, Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy.
Siuntiolainen Bengtström believes that the operation of the state's junaleikkuri is shortsighted.
The same mistakes are made, what has been done in the past and repeats them in a very systematic way.
Then becomes a modicum of.
Y-trains are also used by other than raaseporilaiset and siuntiolaiset, because it is a quick and bypass many of the stations.
Espoolaista Annina Pöyryä harmitti train urban wards away from the fate of the plough.
"It is precisely the misery for those who are forced to plan their journey again," he said of the kivutessaan Y train.
A slight relief is going to be.
Rantaradalle is probably going to be a new train, which will replace the Y-train traffic in the Helsinki region (HSL) in the region - that is, until the Kirkkonummelle takes.
This will increase the cost of HSL level, in other words, in practice, the municipalities and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to clarify the various options and their impact on the palvelutasoon and lipunhintoihin," said HSL's CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
The cost is still impossible to assess accurately.
Rihtniemi tells us that, based on the number of passengers in the HSL has paid the Y-boat, roughly 1 million a year, the ministry, of course, much more than that.
The upcoming Pääradalla R-Line leaves the interval between the two positions.
Instead, the number of Ainolassa and Saunakalliossa junavuorojen doubles.
The whole country will stop for a total of 28 small role and a number of routes.
The ministry will no longer buy rail traffic in the estuary reiteiltä Nurmes, the Tampere Keuruu and Jyväskylä Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The estuary of the Pieksämäki reitiksi will shorten the route of the Pieksämäki theft.
The routes will be reduced in the Riihimäki Junavuorot Lahti, the Hanko cattle, the Kouvola kotkan port and the Kajaani Oulu.
Lakkautettavilla vuoroilla makes more than half a million trips a year, when a total of ministry buying road trips is around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring the state the 12.3 million in annual savings.
The value of the contract is approximately 27.5 million euros a year.
Sixten Korkman wrote the chapter in the timeliness of capital -kirjaan: "Rather support to delve into the"
The global economic crisis has brought down Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his years in 1867-1894 pääteoksensa published in the capital, SKP writes: As a former chairman of the famous St George Hakanen book published today on the timeliness of Marx's capital.
"He is now more seriously than in a long time," writes esipuheessaan Hakanen.
Marx's estimates for the development of the capitalist economy, the process of internationalisation and a growing invasion in all areas of life, the concentration of capital, as well as the growing role of the rahapääoman and imaginary capital have proved to be amazingly kaukonäköisiksi.
Based on the private equity seminars organized by Hakasen kirjoittajalistasta book is also found in the Aalto University professor, a distinguished talousosaaja Sixten Korkman.
The book Korkman writes Marx to be topical, "now and forever."
Surely, the former director of the institute and a business delegation in the business, however, is not a Marxist?
Not after all.
Korkman tells us on the phone that he did not like Marx timely yhteiskuntateoreetikkona talousajattelijana but rather interesting.
These days, however, are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, a historian, a sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitaattori and an expert on literature.
"The common perception is that the men who died in the aatehistoria tells the wrong opinions," Korkman begin.
The truth is that Marx's predictions went drastically wrong.
Even though Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial revolution, he drew the conclusions of exporting capitalism began too far, Korkman is thinking.
But the Korkman, however, sees the value of Marx radikaalissa mentality.
"Relevantimpaa Marxissa is the fact that he asked good questions," he says.
Now, will be discussed again in Marxinkin 'interests such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx can perhaps provide inspiration for anyone who wants to understand the big picture, as a result of the technological revolution in the changing world," Korkman's analysis.
But in what the government should make a decision tomorrow, Marxista does not help.
His mielestäänhän capitalism was a hopeless case, which should just stop.
Yet rather Korkmanin believes it is worth having a look at it.
"70 in the 21st century Marx was unable to read," says Korkman.
"The Maoists and the trotskilaiset and other sects vihasivat all capitalism, but even more to each other."
Today, the debate is more varied, and also the Marx takavuosien can be approached without the ideological and political legacy.
"Every yhteiskuntatieteilijän should consult Marx's ideas - such as the other klassikoihin," says Korkman.

Whether poliisilaitoksella people in Helsinki, Inspector Seppo Kujala?
For the time being, at least, it seems that will be enough.
The police työtaisteluasioihin I did not take a position.
According to the Helsinki Kujalan is coming due to the mielenilmauksen tukipartioita elsewhere in Finland.

Yes, the Finns are rational and peaceful people, "Kujala said.
In many parts of Finland will take place on Friday, the local protests.
Friday's event is in many ways an exceptional - remember these strikes and demonstrations?
A big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday, is in many ways an interesting and unusual.
It does not, for example, can be found in a Finnish political history were very good, says Jyväskylän University sociology professor emeritus Martti Siisiäinen.
As such, it is no wonder that the trade union movement protested.
If it fails to do so, it would raise our hands in front of the government, Siisiäinen says.
A right-wing government has hit ydinkohtiin korporatismin Finnish tradition - and also the sort of items that have been vital to the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's harsh measures are missing contract law.
There are a lot of features to the fact that the trade union movement is really trying to get to his knees.
At the same time, also by the trade union movement in the mirror when it is.
Peiliä is needed, for example, that the trade union movement is by no means all of the employees' support mielenilmauksille on Friday.
It is now a sharp division, which will result in a demonstration of it by the trade union movement would like to take part in the demonstration.
In different parts of Finland gathered the unemployed eduskuntatalolla demonstrated in November 1993.
If you were looking for mielenilmaukselle on Friday, could it be the unemployed jättimielenosoitus, Murrostorstai took place in 1993, Siisiäinen says.
In the midst of the deepest recession held Murrostorstai collected together the 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Aho (kesk) government kompuroi työmarkkinakriisistä in the second.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and palkansaajajärjestöjen had never been as bad as during the Aho porvarihallituksen.
Now, the relations between the government and the trade union movement are perhaps even worse than at the time of Murrostorstain.
Besides, the power is now in Finland's very porvarihallitus ever, Siisiäinen says.
The current governing coalition is still interesting in that way, that it is so tight right-wing perussuomalaisten, despite the rhetoric.
Yet jytkyn found there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
On Friday, several thousand protesters are expected to attend.
A protest to stop the public transport and possibly closing nurseries and schools.
Although the event gets the undivided support of employees, it could become the largest in many years.
In Helsinki, has in recent years, there have been about 300 demonstrations each year.
There is a whole spectrum of them.
Traditionally, the Finnish trade union movement in the protests have been relatively quiet - even though the practices have deteriorated in recent years.
Traditionally, a Finnish demonstration will avoid conflict, we are law-abiding.
The protesters are trying to avoid any harm or destruction of property, Siisiäinen says.

Mielenosoituskulttuuri changed.

According to the Sipilän speeches may not necessarily always ignored officious channels in the future.
If you want to be as a conduit for other channels, so then we will see.
Now, this evening, is used in this channel, Sipilä said.
According to the Sipilän Finland's economic situation is so serious that it requires the marketing of television and radiopuheen citizens.
This dossier, what we are talking about, it is quite complex and requires a long argument.
Therefore, we came up with this link, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be sent to the clock the 05 21.20, as well as TV1 and Radio in Finland.
It can also watch the Yle Areenassa.
Sipilä will take a big risk
Mediatutkija hopes that the Sipilän televised speech by telling the more general government's inward.
In an attempt to take a public debate about whether the määrittelyoikeus more firmly into their own hands and refuse to engage in a public debate kysymyksenasetteluista? Considering the Stockholm University Professor Anu Koivunen.
It reminds one of the Foreign Secretary (Timo Soini) in the recent comment about the fact that he does not comply with the media agenda and not allow it to define themselves.
In the name of the democratic debate and the public in the hope that these things are not related.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media are incensed by Sipilän's announcement.
It would be strange if the media environment does not react.
Policy makers are not ilmoitusasioita viestintätyylit in a democracy.
The representatives of the media's role is by definition try to ensure that the politicians' agendas take annettuina.
According to the TV chat by Koivusen Sipilälle is a big risk.
In his speech, Sipilän ought to bring something new to the table and, in particular, in order to make the speech set exceptionally high expectations have been met.
Whether it is more available today, what we have already heard?
Or will he be able to speak in different tone, in a different way and different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if the pipeline is just more of the same old thing, must wonder why such a grand gesture was made and the Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
Ylekin will take on this risk in that sense, if it is not a specific situation but rutiinipuhe, among others.
The danger is that the Yle leimautuu viestimeksi politicians or the parliament and the government, which is certainly not in keeping with the general pattern of interests or officious.
Sipilältä a clever
Sipilän the upcoming speech is important, too, is what the Prime Minister left unsaid, mediatutkija points out.
The evening will be watching very carefully what Sipilä is missing and what is not, says the University of Jyväskylän tutkimuskoordinaattori Heikki Kuutti.
According to the Kuutin Sipilältä TV speech is a clever move, because that is the way it will be able to pick up his own position without protesting.
This message will be a big audience without journalistic filters, in contrast to a briefing, where the journalists will be able to ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypass the media and speak directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media will interpret the speech something wrong, because going into further questions will not be present.
According to the Kuutin is very important, how Sipilä occurs in TV: Celebrity - valuuko hiki, vapisevatko hands.
He compares with Sipilää isähahmoon, which now tells people what to do.
If the Sipilä part to put their house in order, it can work.
The situation is different than it was when the government will report about something, because this man, as if talking directly to another person.
This kind of (US President Barack) Obama and the partners to exercise on a regular basis.
A really exceptional
Political scientist Erkka railo to the Prime Minister's speech, the public is truly exceptional.
According to him, this has not happened in decades, that the Prime Minister will speak directly to the people.
An exceptional time will require exceptional measures, railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to get in front of the Finns receptive to kiristyksille.
Palkansaajajärjestöt will organise a demonstration on Friday, and the strike against the government's actions.
Twitterissä vasemmistoliiton chairman Paavo Arhinmäki says that Sipilä could make his speech on the state of the nation, Prime Minister of the Swedish Parliament notification, which also can be reached to discuss the speech.
SDP's chairman Antti rinne (sd.), meanwhile, announce haastavansa Sipilän dialogue.
Now is not the time for monologeille.
Soon after the elections in six months.
You cannot hide forever, rinne Twitterissä writes.

Säästöpakettiin SAK withhold their position - Lyly: Decisions on Monday
SAK's chairman Lauri Lyly Twitterissä tells us that palkansaajajärjestö will consider its position on Monday, STTK's säästölistaan to come up with an alternative.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK's Twitterissä proposal.
Toimihenkilökeskusjärjestö STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he will put forward its own proposal to the government, which the Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (kesk) demanded a five per cent tuottavuusloikka are achieved.
Akavan chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the government will approve the proposal, if the SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the biggest palkansaajajärjestö SAK marshall in its position.
SAK's chairman, Lauri Lyly Twitterissä niukkasanaisesti, in turn, commented on the matter.
Lyly writes that the SAK's working committee will take up the matter on Monday.
According to the Lylyn työmarkkinalukon SAK is searching for solutions to the "open" and that instead of the pakkolakien requires active agreements made by the parties.
Lyly recalls that the government of Prime Minister Sipilän SAK yhteiskuntasopimukseksi proposal is not to have lived.
The social Sipilä broke off the negotiations in the past, when the SAK tuottavuusloikan refused to commit to a five per cent target.
Comment: The threat of a major demonstration, "Tuntuuhan lässähtää it little hassulta to thrash out fist"
The little hassulta Tuntuuhan to thrash out fist, if your pocket is already sovintopaperi, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
Moods vary from palkansaajaleirissä across the board.
Is supposed to shout down the government, or even to agree with it?
On Monday, the SAK's liittojohtajat puhkuivat holy hatred towards the government of the Republic.
The whole Finland was threatened to be caught.
Uho akavalaisiinkin spread.
Teachers' union OAJ uhkaili closure of schools and nurseries.

On Wednesday, toimihenkilökeskusjärjestö STTK's chairman, Antti Palola (sd) was how to work.
He told us that it had contacted the government and establish a Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (kesk) tuottavuusloikaksi demanded by the alternative proposal for a five per cent.
President of Akavan Sture Fjäder (Kok) rushed immediately to announce that his sopupaperinsa is already prepared.
SAK's office did not initially belonged to pihaustakaan.
Chairman Lauri Lylyn (sd) is a difficult sopuilla when liittojohtajat was ordered on Monday to bring the country's stand on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK's working committee will meet next Monday to deal with the situation and that the SAK is searching for solutions to open up the "työmarkkinalukon."
In order to create a common depiction of the employees, the SAK's tuottavuusloikka should yield to approve the 5% target.
No surprise then, that the Palolan STTK is OK Sipilän relations with the government.
The right hand Palolan, STTK's director for yhteiskuntavaikuttamisesta Jukka Ihanus acted earlier in the centrist prime ministers, Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemen erityisavustajana.

Russia accused of Finland to a bad: "This must not happen again"
The Russian State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkinin believes that Mongolia is the master of the OSCE is better than Finland.
The Mongolian capital, Ulan Batorissa syysistunto has begun in the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE, where Naryshkin submitted extensive comments on the Helsinki heinäkuisesta juhlakokouksesta.
Then Finland did not allow pakotelistalle venäläispoliitikkojen affected in the European Union, such as Naryshkinin, the arrival of the meeting - an issue on which the President which made to remind journalists.
Our assessment is that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not be repeated, according to the news agency Interfaxin Naryshkin stressed.
Naryshkinin criticism was Finland and the EU, in addition to the United States, where his access was also blocked.
The sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin said.
Mongolia, Russia's delegation was able to follow, so the Naryshkin continued piikittelyä Finland by praising and me begin by praising Mongolia "excellent organisation."
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will work constructively and with a positive balance sheet - in contrast to the meeting, which was held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that the parliamentary be solved through dialogue belong to be obstacles.
Naryshkin has met with Ulan Batorissa meeting leading Ilkka Kanervan (Kok), which according to venäläismedian has already discussed with the Russian delegation.

Tappara Hakametsässä härkäpäiviä and the lock will continue today, when both are on fire on the second day of the nights.
Janne Lahti anticipates that Hakametsässä today to see the actual maalijuhlia.
Tappara was yesterday Kuopiossa kairaamassa 3-2-jatkoaikavoiton KalPasta.
Rises were miehekäs, because last season was the worst in two goal by hopearyhmä tappioasemasta.
On Tuesday was mollivoittoisempi lock.
Raumalaisten catch takkuisesti pyöreät Bluesin during the time the guest had zero points, and similarly tappiolukemat 2-3.
A hard game, paints a tight, if any are playing the same game as last year, the lock on the aggressor Janne Lahti anticipates systems in the pages of the club.
Raumalaisille Tapparasta has become quite a in the playoff nightmare.
Tappara is one of two in the previous period finaalisarjasta tipauttanut välierissä just lock.
On both occasions, the solution has been a decisive seventh matsi.
Last season the lock took a series of katkolle early in the fourth game, but Tappara rose alongside the next three and over.
Formations of the groups do not maalivahteja except no major changes.
Both yesterday rejected the huilivuoron kassarit will receive today.
Mika Noronen Tapparan goals to make room for Tomi Karhuselle, and the lock between the tolppien Rasmus rinne will replace Ryan Zapolskin.
Perspective: Ässissä underway a pitiful spectacle
Urheilujohtaja Toivola käsikirjoitti päävalmentaja Rautakalliolle inappropriate postgraduate section, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It is a classic.
In 1976, the Rocky Sylvester Stallone käsikirjoitti film, in which he featured in the leading role.
Altavastaaja put sensaatiomaisesti wanted raskaansarjan maailmanmestarille Apollo Creedille.
Rocky received great sympathy, even though eventually lost titteliottelun.
Thirty years after the next evening Rockyn Mika Toivola käsikirjoitti Poriin turbulent tuhkimotarinan.
Anonymous, and to everyone's surprise SM puukätinen patapakka progressed through to the final in 2006.
The team was full of the kind of anonymous but persistent altavastaajia Rockyn.
It was White intiaania, Porin suggests and Pele Peltosta.
Pudotuspeleissä players värjäsivät their heads in red and cut down irokeesit.
Toivolasta became blond.
A good TV JP they put a noble called valmentajaa Neumanniksi.
Voitetun Ässät took the silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Käsikirjoittaja Toivola believes that this period uutuusteos works in the same way as it was ten years ago.
Ässien urheilutoimenjohtajana, a man who has built patapakan on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton are kaukalossa mätkineet guys here than teurastamolla sianruhoja Rocky.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparisen earnings are somewhere other than kiekollisessa identification.
Toivola has forgotten that Rocky VI bulk to make Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri stone is ristinyt Rautakallion Sean Conneryksi.
Toivolan käsikirjoittamassa Rockyssä Rautakallio is just as clumsy as the alkuperäisteoksessa Connery would have been in 1976.
Rockyä Rautakalliossa is nothing more than a nickname.
Rautakallion pelifilosofiaan do not belong ryntäily and pikkusikailu.
He appreciates a hard game, but it is one thing to play hard than pigs.
Last season Ässien Garret Stafford taklasi Tapparan Jere Karjalaista in the head.
He received from the judges 2 + 10 minutes, but the Rautakallio put a man's shower a week.
He did not deserve even one minute!
We are playing only those who deserve it.
I do not accept that kind of game and it is not ässäkiekkoon, gets a Satakunnan Rautakallio ärähti occurred after the game to the people.
Ässien this season, the team has been strangely constructed.
It is junnuja, veterans, police officers and kohnottajia.
In the best game in the age avainmiehiä is practically nothing.
It is no wonder that taitovajetta päävalmentaja has complained.
How much you're able to influence the pelaajahankintoihin, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season will have an impact on purchases and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was quite narrow, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
Beneath the surface are smouldering.
Vuosimallin 1953 Rautakallio is reportedly keen to move Toivolan urheilupomoksi here.
Men's contracts expire in the spring.
Liigamatsissa Ässien's track record in three season is one of the many losses maalierolla 1 to 6.
Käsikirjoittaa Toivolan would not have supported the postgraduate part.
Olga Temonen plays a Sipe Santapukin mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if he had met her husband Tuukan a teenager, they would not have had anything in common.
Olga Temonen playing for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I have a friend of my husband's mother in the film.
In a way, it seems crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laugh.
He has been married to Apulannan ex ­ basistin and with Tuukka Temosen since 2008.
Couple has done a lot of work together in the past, but now, for the first time, Olga plays a Tuukan guidance.
Apulannan Olgan role in the earliest kertovassa you did us a beautiful -elokuvassa rumpali Sipe Santapukin mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tsemppaa and supported by her son, even though his father Risto (which makes Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I got to know the real esikuvaani Sirkkaan, it made it easier for the presentation of the role seems to have gone.
He is a great character and I am grateful to the Tuukalle, that he trusted me for the role.
Olga elokuvaprojektia Sirkan had met before, but after that, kaksikko has moved closer to a lot.
They have met, talked on the phone and viestitelleet.
Sirkka has helped a lot in.
We have had a lot of different corners of their history.
Fortunately, Sirkka also understands that the drama is a drama, and the truth is perhaps a little värittää.
Olga points out that Sirkka Heinolassa was almost the only one who blindly believed that Apulannasta will become Finland's biggest bändi.
In the Nineties there was a recession and the depressing reality.
It was time for a small chance of someone actually succeeds, but there was some intuitio Sirkalla, and he was right.
Olga tells us that he had heard a lot of this nuoruudesta Tuukalta before elokuvasuunnitelmia.
The stories of parents, however, have been a little different in between.
So, if you're a teenager, 15 years old, so how much do parents really know what puuhasit.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different than the Heinolan Tuukan, known as a notorious skeittarina.
Olga was the everyday life and a nice girl, which would have had nothing to do with the film's Tuukan.
At best, he could have been secretly ihastua.
According to the Olgan for 10 years, he has done so much work with Tuukan, that a big joint project will not be intimidated by it.
Everyone has always been superhyvin.
Now, the whole Heinolaan tuotantoryhmä leaves for months in the descriptions.
Although the couple living Iitissä intends to drive due to their young children often also the nights at home, because the distance is not too long.
Power throughout the whole Heinolan months.
They have put us in a warm, asking only that the streets of what and when they are emptied.

I have been quite sick rentona!
I have such a script for rento fiilis, because I know exactly what leffasta should come in.
All of the group seem to realise that doing something unprecedented.
It is wonderful to go to Belgium.
Even if the time is tight, there is no fear perseessä.
I am more excited by it, and I cannot wait to get this leffan näytettyä audience, he tells Iltalehdelle.
Originally, the film's budget was planned for 8 to 10 million, but the script develops, the budget also grew.
The budget is big, but it is a big stoorikin.
However, the cinema would be tungettua 100 million, because each kuvakulma and tehosteet are so expensive.
Now everyone has veered so tight that there is no lax.
The film Iron Sky Universe tuotantoyhtiö launched today, Wednesday, joukkorahoituskampanjan and joukkolainan, which pays 4% to 8% vuosikorkoa.
Final interest rate will be determined according to supply and demand during the course of the campaign.

Toimintaelokuvassa play, among other things, Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Coolia Junttia or?
The big logos will return shirts
Trendsettereiden rintamuksia have recently adorned the big logos.
Not so long ago muotitietoinen pukeutuja avoided clear and big logoja Crocseja than Jesus.
Hupparin or t-shirt brand advertising was seen as somewhat junttina.
But the times are changing.
Megatrendi Sporttisuudesta has become a fashion, and so, too, the old, familiar sporttimuotimerkit such as Adidas and Nike have risen cooliuden aallonharjalle.
And, as so often in the past, the hassun and trendikkään boundary is a fluid one: If something is already junttia correctly, it starts to become ironiseksi and cooliksi.
First came the norm core -trendi, i.e. tavismuoti, which overtook the trendsetterit by favouring the most tedious perusvaatteita as a way to differentiate by weight.
Now, instead of putting it on top of the grey peruscollegen has already gone down in the depths of the kaapin verkkapaita, which, in front of the manufacturer's logo.
What a bigger and more traditional, so much the better.
For example, in addition to logojen Adidaksen identifiable raitaverkkarit, suosikkijoukkueen pelipaidat and the New York Yankees katumuotiin lippikset have made a comeback.
On alka farkkujen pilkistävät alkkareiden the Calvin Klein logos are now in a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sporttimerkeiltä luksusbrändeille, too.
Versacen syyspuseroiden rintamus, for example, makes it clear that allowing merkkisestä is all about.
Pukeutumisessasi logoja Olisitko you ready to present?
Venäläispoliitikko published a piece of evidence: I am stuck in a tank on luukkuun hours!
According to the allegations of a peculiar incident had happened in the Nizhni Tagilissa, which was held in the Russian military products presenting Russia Arms Expo 2015.
The Russian media over the past few days have spread to the colourful claims that Russia's hätätilaministeriö was forced to mobilise suurikokoista Zotovia tankinluukusta for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in hiding information.
He even published a picture on her own public Facebook, in which she looks luukusta kurkistavan therefore penetrate a very good spirit, and certainly not on the basis of their images is no off or suuttumisesta.
Absolute nonsense.
Starting with the fact that I am gone taistelupanssarivaunuun inside, but it was the rynnäkköpanssarivaunu BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, everstiluutnantti, I have served the Urals.
I went there, I looked around me and I came out of the peace, Komosomolskaja Pravdalle Zotov said.
I am stuck in and I really spent five hours in that position, he said.
The Russian army TV channel Zotov explained ihastelleensa exhibition on Russia's new technology, because he is himself a former ammattisotilas.
That is why I was interested in, what is inside the wagons, ihastelin us our technologies.
And I came out through the takaluukun, he said.
I went to all the tankeissa.
The next exhibition, and I fully intend to hold all the tankeissa and all the rynnäkköpanssarivaunuissa, Zotov promised.
Zotov also scolded us typerykseksi wrote about the journalist.
One of the dunce wrote, and all the others echoed.
Nothing that was not.
I went inside, and I came out of it.
I have a long and roteva, but nothing that I would be somewhere stuck in your tank, did not happen, he said Russkaja sluzhba novostei -radiolle.
Zotovin words is supported by the fact that none of the alleged many in the photographs have not been published, even though asenäyttelyssä went in a few days, a total of 50 000 people.
The claim was originally started off Zotovin Bloknot.ru website affair, in which it was reported Zotovin rimpuilleen tankinluukusta out to try and end up threatening to shoot all those around them, unless he cannot get pinteestään.
Later published by the website Bloknot jatkojutun, in which the exhibition organisers have told their own views on what has happened.
All are just accustomed to the fact that the soldiers panssaroiduista hyppäävät quickly out of the vehicles.
But the MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply viipyili when he came out of it.
But not, under any circumstances, he sat there for five hours, the coordinator of the exhibition, said Alexander Pisarevski Bloknotille.

The psychologist advises: Kerrot saw the children of refugees
Many parents have experienced over the last few days to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees trying to enter Europe.
Or does it tell at all?
It does not need to be forced to raise, the SPR's Crisis Group member, the psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children are worth protecting, and not, for example, to allow them to watch the news on its own.
Small children are not always able to understand the näkemäänsä, and it can be reminiscent of the rolling and the anxiety is understandable, he says.
However, if the child is seen in front of the television uutiskuviin refugees or heard elsewhere, it would be worth it to take up the issue.
It is a good debate to hold the child's premises and to listen carefully to what he is asking.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily those whom the parent thinks his fear.
Children should not be bullied in vain, even though it ahdistaisi and pelottaisikin.
Smaller child will closely monitor the behaviour of their parents.
If the parents themselves will remain calm during the debate, even a child feels they are safe.
The bigger children are confronted with a discussion on the refugees is likely to be in school, with the boys' or on the Net.
It is good for parents to take with them on the issue, if it was up to the child.
The fact is that not all people in the world are not things well.
Parents can, together with the children to think about how we are viewed in this family.
If we believe that in the end, however, the world is safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also be different kasvatusnäkökulmia - some people may want to protect their children, according to the possibilities of fear.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about the difficult issues, the children will be a model for how to deal with the difficulties of life.
This can be useful to him in the future.

The latest increase in these programmes is the Apple Watch, which entered the pakkopäivityksenä iPhone phones, even if it is only necessary for the owners of Apple's älykellon.
According to Mr Cook, Apple's removal of the programmes is more complicated than it looks off.
Some of the applications are present in another iPhonessa.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says Buzzfeedille.
Cook did not mention what the Apple's iPhone applications are working closely together with the other programmes.
There are other programs that do not work that way.
So, with time, I think that we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is looking into the matter, because the company does not want to squander the muistitilaa iPhone users "phones.

The Fed is trying to tighten monetary policy in the US
The next recession begins in the United States reached its highest levels in less than a year's time, but more so in the three years after the country's central bank, meanwhile, will take a long time for the Fed to cut interest rates.
And the decline in financial markets, in turn, will begin before the next recession.
The Fed has insinuated to koronnostot, possibly as early as this week, and no later than the end of the year.
So, the next recession is able to press on the Financial Stability Board reached its highest levels in the next autumn and kurssirytinä before that.
Or at least that is what will happen if the world's largest economy and the financial markets are acting as if they have been used, and if they are reacting to the blackmail of rahahanojen Fedin as we have done before.
The conclusions of this kind have ended up in the London market study saksalaispankki Deutsche Bank strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and SEB Barker in the broad market and taloussyklien long paper.
The bank jakeli more than 60 pages of Long-Term asset return Study -tutkimusraportin international suurasiakkailleen last week.
A report on the research and produced uskottele strategists do not know exactly when the Fed will start to raise or cut interest rates in a market economy, and what happens after that.
Instead, they are presenting the facts viileiden economic statistics and through the way, how the economy and the markets have behaved in the past koronnostojen Fedin time and after.
In addition to the historical findings, they will look at what the economy and the financial markets at the key variables are now in the same or a different model than the previous koronnostojen achieved - and what it might entail.
It is apparent that both the economy than the huterammassa finanssimarkkinatkin are now in order to withstand a rise in interest rates than it has been since the 1950s.
At the beginning of the recession may not a year
Fedin monetary policy and its current virityksestä will choose the leaders are the last summer and alkusyksyä implied that the time will soon be ripe nostoon interest rates.
The first interest rate hike in more than nine years, could come as early as this week.
It will be sorted out during the course of Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called avomarkkinakomitea Fedin Executive Board will meet to decide the matter kaksipäiväiseen meeting.
The last time the Fed raised the so-called the Fed -ohjauskorkoaan funds in June 2006.
Then it ended exactly two years of a relatively regular basis but a series of small koronnostojen 0.25 percentage points, in which the Fed raised 5,25 korkonsa 1.25 per cent per cent.
The Financial Stability Board oireilu began in 2007, the American riskipitoisimman asuntorahoituksen difficulties, and a year later, the global financial crisis collapsed into a nightmare of doom.
Big recession comes back in 2009.
The last time the financial markets and the real economy, serious setbacks began more slowly than in the past after koronnostojen Fedin has typically been the case.
Similarly, this was then a harsher and karumpia than ever since the 1930s depression.
Seuloneet Deutschen strategists are the largest economies in the world rises and falls, as well as shifts in the financial markets since 1950 onwards, and in some places, always from the beginning of the 19th century.
Koronnostoista Fedin and their economic and finanssivaikutuksista they have accounted for since the 1950s.
The launch of the recession has reached its highest levels since the time of the first to raise interest rates less than a year, usually in less than three years, and an average of less than three and a half years.
The Financial Stability Board kurssinousu is closed in the year since the start of the two koronnostojen Fedin over.
The Fed has periodically raised and periodically dropped its interest rates since the beginning of the 1950s equivalent of a dozen erimittaisen cycle.
Each time I have called in some parts of others, and the times are relatively rare in the review, so they hardly can deduce anything in the bag for the next koronnostojen effects.
Strategists muistuttavatkin, that this time, many things have changed.
And not just the better.
The interest rates too low for too long
Key causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits will not necessarily be conclusively identified at least tutkimustyöllä decades.
But the three points that demonstrate the crisis and its juggernaut kasvattaneista reasons may be somewhat indisputably clear:
1) the Fed, the euro zone, the ECB and other major central banks around the world in the 21st century ohjauskorkojaan kept too low for too long.
They paikkailivat teknokuplan traces, and grew at the same time, the next.
2) fiscal and various parts of the real economy, which has been built up over the decades and the already too large a monumental amount of debt grew ylilöysän Banks on the impact of monetary policy is more important than ever before.
Was born in the biggest velkakupla siihenastisen fiscal history.
3) Those who packed into the finanssitalouteen near pidäkkeittä hullunhalpa velkarahoitus paisutti for most areas of the Financial Stability Board siihenastisen fiscal history's greatest kurssikuplia shares in real estate, bonds and commodities.
There is hardly a fierce controversy that still relies on mutkikkaampien velkavipujen heights rising financial markets were extraordinarily dangerous and unstable then, when the US Federal Reserve and other central banks had driven up the rates for the last time.
On Velkavipujen viritetyt finanssirakennelmat arvostuskuplat did not endure much less than his time after koronnostot had begun and the rise in debt financing costs were turned in.
The risks were realised finanssikriisinä, and it was followed by a major recession.
A bigger bubble and more debt
Deutschen strategists do not arvaile, what happens next, but will give tuumailun cause by mentioning, for example, the following points:
1) the US Federal Reserve and other major central banks are now kept its monetary policy still kevyempänä viritystä even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even longer even lower.
2) the debt is not for a long time been hullunhalpaa as ten years ago, but now the halvimmillaan velkaraha is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, there is no financial and real economy velkalasti keventynyt but now in different parts of the economy is affected by a hell of a lot more cumbersome velkakuorma than before the financial crisis, or for that matter, at any point in the past.
3) More vuolaampana and less costly central banks issuing left the liquidity has largely remained finanssimarkkinoille and kalleimmilleen omaisuuslajit hilannut core securities and then the financial crisis leading up to the top, or at any time.
And strategists varoitusmerkeillä latista mood only in the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy is not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the recession in decades, the most burdensome in the model than it has been in the past.
The eurozone economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak, but equally, financial pressures and risks incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed starts to tighten rahahanojaan now more tightly.
Perhaps ranskalaispankki Societe Generalen strategin Albert Edwardsin picture of the future is not as strange as it may seem äkkiseltään.
He is now a good time to see the bank's international investor täyskäännöksiin Fedin customers of the following:
First, the Fed will raise interest rates, then the Fedin finanssikuplat burst - and soon, time is running out to extinguish the finanssipaloja an even bigger QE raharuiskuilla.

Ahtisaari Guardianissa: The West rejected Russia's proposal to the al-Assad is being sidelined
Western countries have rejected Russia's offer of more than three years ago, in which the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have been to relinquish power, says Guardianille President Martti Ahtisaari.
According to Ahtisaari, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, suggested the plan, in which the al-Assad would have eventually receded from power with elegance.
The West, however, did not come to grips with the proposal, because they believed the al-Assad fall anyway in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012, the UN Security Council's five permanent with the Member States.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador Vitaly Tshurkin has listed her face discussion three point plan: The opposition did not receive the arm, between the opposition and Assad had to immediately get puheyhteys and al-Assad from power had to be carried out at a moderate pace.
I know Tshurkinin.
We may not agree on all issues, but we will be able to discuss openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said that sit in Alas, Martti, so I will tell you what we have to do, Ahtisaari has remembered in an interview with the Guardian.
The diplomats not commented on
Ahtisaari tells välittäneensä Tshurkinin message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Newspaper Tshurkin has confirmed the contents of the discussion, but according to the Ahtisaari, there are no two words.
Also, the UN diplomats refused to refrain from commenting on Mr Ahtisaari's allegations, but said that al-Assad's troops were already at that time made a series of massacres and the main opposition groups refused to all agreements, in which he would have remained in power.
The British Foreign Office in the Middle East, the former head of the department of Sir John Jenkins takes his words cautiously, because, according to his experience in Russia was never prepared to discuss the fate of Assad.
Officially, Russia has been supporting al-Assad throughout the period of the war.
Ahtisaari, the weakest point in the argument is that the Tshurkin spoke of Moscow's mandate.
If he would have told me the Tshurkinin speeches, I would have answered that I would like to hear from the president, Vladimir Putin, so that I can take it seriously.
Jenkins says that he would be there, too, doubted that it would have been Putin's trick to keep power in one of the al-Assad tukijalla.
Of their own tekosiamme
Ahtisaari's negotiations over the crisis in Syria had been dead for about 7 500 people.
The United Nations estimates that the death toll exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have done to prevent this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe has its own tekosiamme.
I see no other option than to keep these raukoista people in good care.
We are now paying the bill, which we have done themselves, Ahtisaari says the newspaper.
Järjestelykeskus tyrkyllä Tornioon asylum seekers
The government's planned in northern Finland is likely to set up järjestelykeskus Tornioon asylum seekers.
The centre would be established in the city centre to the Tornion yhteislyseon empty building.
The Ministry of the Interior has been searching for the need for a suitable location, so that the influx of refugees from the border in Sweden to gain better control.
The Helsinki messages is reporting that on Tuesday, that the council had already decided to make koulurakennusta tilaratkaisuksi Department.
Tornion City Council Vice President Sauli Hyöppisen (vas.) says that it is not true.
When the council had not been met, and part of the porukasta wanted a formal decision, we decided to call the board of governors meeting next Monday to decide on the issue, he specifies the STT.
There were 36 councillors at a meeting in the 43.
Järjestelykeskusta opposed the 13 councillors.
On the basis of it could wait for a decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to the mayor of the city of Timo Nousiaisen got to be disbursed on Monday, and the issue was swiftly.
Yhteislyseoon can accommodate an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been inspection, that it could apply to such a place.
The location is a few hundred metres from the border, so in that respect, it would be workable, Nousiainen said.
Kiristyksille Sipilä is hoping for more from the labour market options
Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (kesk.) was in the public eye, according to halving the lomarahojen will handle only a portion of the government from seeking to reduce the price of the work.
However, he said the government will take against the fond vaihtoehtopaketin, if the sides can agree on something.
Swedish Parliament Sipilä, told reporters that he has not been in contact with which.
He also does not know how seriously the organizations are looking for alternative ways of working life kiristyksille has announced the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
It would halve Lomarahojen Sipilän believes it as a way of working, because it would affect nearly all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government's sunnuntailisien operation.
The two sides of industry could be cut in lomarahojen among themselves, because they are enshrined in law, rather than a collective agreement.
The government says it likely next week, on Wednesday, Parliament 's blackmail in professional life.
According to the Sipilän organisations in the proposals should be known before this.
The final deadline is not even that.
This work begins at the start of the train is on the move, and it gets harder all the time.
Now is a very short time.
After all, it will not be long in such matters, if the will is there, Sipilä said.
The government last week with the publication of the list is, among other things, changing the loppiaisen and helatorstain palkattomiksi vapaapäiviksi vuosityöaikaa lyhentämättä.
In addition to the initial sairauspäivien salary cuts, halve the overtime, sunnuntaikorvauksia will be reduced to 75% and the holidays are shortened.
The reforms will be implemented urgent legislation over the trade unions, which has provoked strong criticism.
The actions of Palkansaajakeskusjärjestöt are organising a major demonstration on Friday, as well as a number of trade unions have declared political strikes.
Mahlahallin Tohmajärven council approved the storage expansion
Tohmajärven was adopted unanimously by the council but a bit Oy nuristen Nordic Koivu's hallin: Mahlahallin storage expansion.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project will have a bigger and more expensive than originally had been.
The busy schedule närästi.
All the little people were astonished that tilatarve had known about a year ago, when it was decided the previous extension.
At this stage, an expansion of the stockpile of 400 to 450 square metre investointiohjelmaan was approved, but the money will be decided at a later date in connection with the osavuosiraportin.
Still on the agenda, there was talk of a EUR 150 000 and 200 000 for investment, but the meeting, the technical director Erkki Ikonen told us that the cost is estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the grounds that it will bring jobs and tax revenue for the local area.

Karelia kielellekin joensuussa room
City authorities by a more radical position in order to bring karjalankielisten katunimikylttien Joensuun centre.
The new decision is an important and timely in terms of upholding the tradition of karjalaisen throughout the province.
The estuary is the capital of julistaudu Karelian language, because it is not a historical argument or the Karelian language is not an intrinsic part of the identity of the region.
Joensuun spoken language in the region has been one of the more eastern savolaismurteisiin.
The centre of the city after the decision of the new regime there will not be karjalankielisiä katunimikylttejä.
The city of Joensuun, however, there is a good case of circumspection is also prepared to introduce the language of Karelia infotauluissa, for example, and the marketing of tourism.
The same approach to the city to recommend for all the other players.
Even though the estuary is officially yksikielinen municipality, so the Karelian language avaramielisesti deserves to be introduced at a time when multiculturalism is alive and will change dramatically in the North Karjalassakin.
The characteristics of the language is still in the province of Karelia, as well as the image of Joensuusta metsäpääkaupunkina Finland as a whole.
Both of them may well take advantage of the marketing of such a variety of the province.
Railway lakkautukset are cutting the vitality of the province
Railway cuts, hit the province's vitality in a tough manner.
Transport links have a direct impact on the competitiveness of the industry and the province.
And it seems to be the fact that whether it is here in the first place to live and work, the mayor of Joensuun Mr Karjalainen is wondering.
He also raises the air, whose sequel has also been mietinnässä on several occasions.

The US Federal Reserve policy makers will sit this week, two days after a huge mahonkipöydän around the long-awaited meeting to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end the Central Bank koristeellista, kaksikerroksista kokoushuonetta seinämaalaus is in the United States.
The map is a reminder that the chairman of the Federal Reserve Janet L. Yellenin and his colleagues will put the nation's economic interests above all else.
Congress has fallen on the shoulders of the Central Bank dual responsibility: They must maximize employment in the United States and to keep prices stable.
The leaders of the central bank, after the Great Depression, however, have accepted that there is also a third, an unwritten mandate: Economic stability.
This is the third requirement can be a decisive factor in the decision will be published on Thursday, which is so tight that it will not even be able to predict, the decision as to whether the US economy vieroitettavaksi ready for the unprecedented stimulus, which until the end of 2008, almost zero remained short term interest rates have brought in.
Although most of the data will show the economy growing steadily, the recent turmoil in global financial markets can be made in advance, the officials of the European Central Bank more säikymmiksi wary when it comes to increasing volatility, it is feared, how would affect, if the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to at least -viitearvoa.
"Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important points, which will be monitored," said Lindsey M. Piegza, meklariliike Stifel Nicolaus & Co's päätalousasiantuntija.
"I do believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for tabling normal interest rates, increased uncertainty in the global market, there is a valid argument for enough to wait," he said.
There is no agreement over the decision by the European Central Bank, which already produces too nervous about the economy.
According to a recent study Bloombergin approximately half of the whole region to predict that interest rates will rise this week.
While the financial markets expect the central bank to delay returning, according to a key indicator for the opportunity for growth is only about 30 per cent.
This refers to the decline in the stock market, if the central bank to raise the rate, unless the leaders then failed to soften the blow by promising that the next drawing will not happen in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average rose 228,89 -indeksi points, or 1.4 per cent, with a new chapter in the 16 599,85.
The recovery brought a expectation that the Federal Reserve will keep rate unchanged this week, says John Lonski, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group -rymän päätalousasiantuntija.
"It is surprising, if the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates right now," he says.
If the leaders push up interest rates, "they need to see a lot of trouble linjauksessaan in order to support the financial markets so that they do not fall into panic."
Some experts argue that the higher rate would be reassuring for financial markets, because it would remove the uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve operates.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates this month, neljännesprosenttiyksiköllä, thus taking the first small step towards the slow state of monetary tightening, which varmentaisi the stability of the recovery in the United States.
Yellen has pointed out in the spring and early summer, that he expects the rate to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals are demanding valituksissaan further economic development.
Though the new job creation has slowed in August, there has been a steady growth in the labour market this year.
Last month, the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent, which is the lowest figure for seven years, and close to the level that the central bank will keep the limit of full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of piristymisestä.
Even though inflation is still below the Bank's 2% vuositavoitteen, according to the Federal Reserve policymakers at the main reason for this is considerably madaltuneen a temporary effect on the price of oil.
The economy "will survive suuremmistakin on rates is currently expected and also needs them, taking into account the tight situation on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics päätalousasiantuntija O2.
The financial markets around the world, however, järkkyivät last week, when China, which also froze their currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by as much as 16 per cent -indeksi ennätyksestään's May, when investors feared a decline in China's economy also hidastavan global growth.
The market has recovered from a bit of this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10 per cent less than huippulukeman in May.
Federal Reserve policy makers in the market turmoil is a contributory factor in the complex equation, which tells us because interest rates will be raised.
"Without these events in the financial markets and the weakness of the media reports about China's economy over the past few weeks, the level of government leaders at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate erikoistutkija Centre, as well as a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the leaders are waiting for at least a month in order to get a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the U.S. economy are still pretty vague, and they do not have much in the way of information at their disposal, what will be the consequences of events in China," Oliner says.
The international economic prosperity is not the main concerns of the Central Bank, so in principle, it should not affect the decision making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the world's monetary authority.
In the last few years there has been a huge influence on the European Central Bank.
In 2013, the then chairman, Ben S. Bernanken, the implication that the central bank may be a "bridge" to increase the amount of money, was caused by the upheaval in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly punoutuneet together, the European Central Bank officials are expected not only to the next developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank says it is "more of an art than a science," says Zachary Karabell, omaisuudenhoitoyhtiö Envestnet Inc: In the head of global strategy.
The federal varantopankin Richmondissa Virginia (Federal Reserve) Chairman Jeffrey Lacker said this month that "the Central Bank has, in the past, overreacted to the campaigns in the financial markets, which have appeared to be separated from the cornerstones of the economy."
A decision-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacker, a voting member of the committee, invokes the example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian financial crisis was caused by the fact that the central bank has cut viitearvoaan 0.75 percentage points during the third meeting, "despite its limited, identifiable by the effects of the economic growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank refuted these cuts.
The financial stability of the European Central Bank should put a priority only during a major crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, the Bank of England (Bank of England), a former member of the koronmäärittämiskomitean.
The latest turmoil is not going to be anywhere near the level, Posen says.
"No one wants to see a situation where people are afraid of an increase in interest rates because the market harmistuvat", the Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute chairman, Posen says.
The Federal Reserve Act (the Act), the Federal Reserve adds will still include dual requirement, and does not mention the financial stability, and as long as that is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Laihdutusleikkaus can help the least obese diabeetikkoja
According to a new study, to say the least liikalihavien laihdutusleikkauksesta type 2 diabetes benefits can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics after laihdutusleikkauksen for longer than those that are dealt with in other ways than the cuts.
"Getting the Kuolleisuustietojen lasts for a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, who is laihdutusleikkausasiantuntija, who wrote editorials in the new research in JAMA Surgery -aikakausjulkaisussa.
Bariatrisissa Laihdutus-, the cutbacks are used different methods to reduce the size of the vatsalaukun.
They reduce näläntunnetta and restrict the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatriset cuts have been effective for type 2 diabetes, but the vast majority of those surveyed have had a pathological obese, and their painoindeksinsä (BMI) has been 35 or more.
The length of the relationship between BMI and weight is considered normal, when it is between 18.5 and 24,9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that there is someone who is obese, and if a person's BMI is over 30, he is considered to be obese.
You can calculate your own BMI: Si here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
In this new study, the researchers taiwanilaisessa Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007, peer learning on early bariatrista two types of surgery, as well as a reduction in mahalaukun ohitusleikkausta mahalaukun, type 2 diabetes lääkkeellisiin treatments for people who were obese, to say the least.
The study showed that the average BMI of severed fell from 31 to 24.5% in the fifth by the end of the year.

Reduced to 36% of people with diabetes improved altogether and 28 per cent in part.
By way of comparison, the total lääkkeellisesti systems group diabetes improved to just 1 per cent, and in part by around 2 per cent.
In addition to blood pressure, triglyseridit, as well as the "bad" LDL-kolestori "were generally better leikkausryhmässä," the authors said.
The researchers followed the patients' blood hemoglobiini -tasoja A1c, which reflect the verensokeritasoja in the long term.
Hemoglobiini A1c dignity should remain less than 7%, the researchers write.
After the surgery, hemoglobiini A1c -taso crashed around 9 per cent to around 6 per cent.
Lääkkeellisen treatment group, however, it remained stable at around 8%.
This is better, "glykeeminen control ', which improved hemoglobiini A1c -tasot illustrate, did not reduce mortality rates for five years, says the päätutkija Dr Chih Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team compared the keskiarvotuloksia between the two different leikkaustyypin.
For the fifth year, when it was compared with the group as mahalaukun pienennysleikkauksessa, mahalaukun ohitusleikkauksessa visited the group had dropped more weight (18,7 and 14.2 kg), has fallen more than painoindeksiään (7.4 and 5.1), has fallen more than hemoglobiini A1c -tasojaan (3.1 per cent and 2.1 per cent), as well as the more likely it was scored a total diabetesremission (46,9 per cent and 16.7 per cent).
University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenixin Blackstone says that even though the study does not seem to be survival or surgery after five years, there are studies from Sweden, where the operation was led by a longer life painavemmilla people.
A Swedish study has found that the laihdutusleikkauksessa käyneillä liikalihavilla was 29 per cent lower chance of dying over a period of 15 years, when the group was compared with them, which had tried traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not seem to be an improvement on leikkauspotilaiden to survive, Blackstone said, however, that the results are encouraging for people whose BMI is less than 35 and who are interested in the cut.
"The findings are crucial in that they show that the operation is safe with lower painoindeksin group," and it has nothing to do with the risk of death or munuaissairauden kohonnutta, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take the weight very seriously at that stage, when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long before we take this very seriously," he said.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare their bodies for obesity and diabetes, the cancellation of the situation is very difficult.

The Dalai Lama has said that Europe will not be able to absorb all the refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.

"It is fantastic to see many of the thousands of refugees, but in the meantime it is forced to think about the long term solutions: How do these Muslim countries can bring real peace and real development, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to look at how we can reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems, "he added.
When commenting on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks, and claimed that the United States was caused by the violent response to the dramatic events of the chain.
"In the wake of the 9 / 11 attack in a letter I submitted my condolences to President Bush and I told him that the solution to this problem can be found via the non-violence.
I know that his motives were good, but he used his strength and it created the unintended consequences, "the Dalai Lama said.

Why I will prove Oklahoma execution
If any legal intervention does not happen, later today, I think, when a man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope that will not, I am sitting in the gallery spectators in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary -vankilassa watching when Richard Glossip executes mounting.
He has asked me to be one of the four official todistajasta death.
In January, I received a request through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I have started kammota this day, on the eve of it.
So why did I accepted?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Journalists, of course, will have the chance to watch the executions in America, and because the applications are often more than the seats, the participants will be selected through a gruesome arvonnan.
Oklahoma has reduced the relative emptiness of the media from 12 to five.
Whoever then valitaankaan, believes viileänä event.
I am unable to do so.
I come to sit next to Richard Glossipin closest friends, and I have created my own contact with him in the months following the telephone, as well as through one of the two and a half hour visit.
I like the man.
Often laughing at jutellessamme.
Prison authorities are saying that I am unable to be witnesses, as well as a journalist, so I may not be with me from what I have seen tallentaakseni muistikirjaa and pencils.
I just need to try to remember all the details.
One journalist accused oklahomalainen Twitterissä that I have pared down neutrality regarding.
This is a lesson to be learned.
Telling the story of the prisoner in his own way, so could participate in.
I complained to a journalist.
Carbon monoxide admitted that "it would have been a better word asetella," but it is still believe that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has been in disagreement with some of the sanomieni and kirjoittamieni affairs.
He did not say what I will write to me, and I would do so even though he would not say.
I have said to him that he may at any time remove me todistajalistaltaan.
But he insists that there is an international journalist who writes on the subject.
If the Glossip dies, he believes that the publicity will help the trend of the death penalty.
Huffington Post bishop Kim Bellware is by my side. "
If you want to know more business, you can listen to the podcast that I took a series of broadcasts.
I will not go through this again in all the details.
I am not able to say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the assassination of Mr Van Treesen would make him guilty of assistance in any case.
But I do believe that there is a very strong chance that he is not guilty of murder.
I am sure that the evidence concerning the death penalty was not enough.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And so it is in this framework that I believe his dying.
I cannot say that I am completely impartial.
There will be other journalists who see the concern.
You get me a description of what it is to be considered when the man, which I love, will die unnecessarily.
The man was lured into away after the River Canning -joesta vetisen poliisijahdin
Constable Canning Valen remained dry, when he persuaded the man away from the Canning -joesta River.
Perthistä from a man's attempt to mislead the police kannoiltaan went wrong when he found himself in a low, poliisimiehestä mutaisesta just yards away from the water, which was trying "to attract him gently back to the beach."
Beckenhamiin Canning Valen, the police were called on Tuesday due to unauthorised interference.
When they saw the suspect, it was trying to mislead them by directing Canning -jokeen River.
However, he did not get very far.
"He stood in the water," I did not come out, come to look for me, "said a senior ylikonstaapeli Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan kastuvan univormunsa Perhavec did not want, so he used a safer tactic: "Decent poliisineuvottelua."
"Sometimes people are doing things in the hassuja trying to escape," said parent ylikonstaapeli Castledine.
Mestarijalkapalloilija Ben Cousins is the emotive example.

Peter Moody says voice tried to spy on him and threatened to stop the rivalry
Peter Moody has claimed that the Victoria Racing officials vakojaan koettivat to infiltrate his talleihinsa last year, and is threatening to stop competing immediately.
He accuses toimitsijoita and the Victoria Racing lahjomattomuusjaostoa, claiming that they have a personal campaign under way against him, and on Wednesday, the rejection of the late Lady Tatain kisapäivänä due to the hoitotoimenpiteen was the last discipline.
Moody told Fairfax media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he is in a bind after an unexplained positive kobolttinäytteen Lidarin.
He has kept in check when it comes to vakoojaväitösten language in a year and a half, and did not want that, "it would look like kateudelta."
"I am not going to say anything about this, and I have long been silent on the issue, but sometimes it frustrated so much that everyone would unravel once and for all," Moody said.
They knew that the situation went on.
Sometimes, we just need to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I will go home tonight and I can sleep well.
I would like to walk with their heads held high and the owners would like to think that I will do my best for them.
When they start to think differently, then I should no longer continue as coach.
Then I would have to consider what I am doing lisenssilleni.
Previously, Moody tipautti racing.com bomb in an interview with the website, in which he said that talliaan lahjomattomuusosasto had tried to spy on her.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I will name him if asked - and offered him a job in the talleillani, if he cares about what I am doing there.
Clearly, they are keeping me eyewash.
If that is the case, it would be separated from their lawyers, because they have failed in my nappaamisessani.
Robert Roulston, a former chairman of the Victoria Racing, David Moodie, the current chairman of the Victoria Racing, as well as Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of the Victoria Racing, were all aware of the issue at the time, and are aware of today.
Should I begin to think that this is becoming a personal?
Whether or not the Victoria Racing finally decided miehistyä and perhaps other than valmentajille shift the responsibility for what is happening in the area?
Am I a harmful in the sector?
Am I so detrimental to the sector?
Perhaps the people think so.
Maybe they should take lisenssini and pushed me aside, and I have no doubt in my mind that may or may not be able to subscribe now to get them to think about it.
But I am now at a point that I do not care any more, and it suretaa me.
It really saddens me.
I urge them to make a decision, which is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn selkäni for this.
The coaching frustration has grown with the longstanding Lidarin kobolttitutkimuksen, and the late rejection has led him to conclude that it could "throw their licences across the table."
Moody, who is best known as the master of Black Caviarin voittamattoman concerning kisapäivän has called the rule of management is "ridiculous" after undergoing or savihaude have been crushed by a horse, which is irregular.
"It is against the rules of the competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
One of the mud työntekijöistäni mistakenly put it in the foot.
It would have been a haude last night.
It could have been it yesterday, as it was.
It was the kisapäivänä.
Moodylla may be ahead for three months due to the kilpailukielto kisapäivän haudehoidon, which officials began their investigation.
It is a joke.
The people who make these rules, do not know anything about horses.
"We all understand that the rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobramissa liikennepakoon guilty of the driver arrested

Storm -joukkueen Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy is attacking painiväitteissä against rivals
Stormin Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the two NRL rugbyliigan mestarisuosikin claims that his team would be part of the "taklaukset line."
Sydney Roosters -valmentaja Trent Robinson said erotuomareiden sallineen Stormin "wrangling" in their side, when it suddenly won the finaalikarsinnan in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos -valmentaja Wayne Bennett which barely conceal viittaustaan Stormiin after it won the North Queensland Cowboysit finaalikarsinnassa on Saturday evening. "Näyteikkunaksi rugbyliigan Bennett called the game" and said that the two teams were "very enthusiastic about the Queenslandin" painista.
Bellamy taklauksia defended the team and said that they only focus on the "deal" taklatessa.
Bellamy added that his confidence was added by the two leading towards the coach Stormia criticism, because it means that they are afraid of the häviävänsä team.
"It always comes up - I have heard Trent Robinson talk about painimisesta when we lost to them in the 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything puolustusjärjestelmissämme or tekniikoissamme throughout the year, in the last six weeks we have only highlighted the taklauksissa contact, and it has led us to thrive.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he is obviously a great team valmennettavanaan, so he is probably not accustomed to disappear, and it was therefore a small shock to him.
Funny how it always comes up at this time of the year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett thought "exciting mentoriaan rugbysta" by pointing out the fact that Bennett valmentama St George Illawarra Dragons won the mastery in 2010 by playing the "tylsästi."
Wayne speaks the exciting rugbysta.
He felt it was important to compare the Saturday-night games we peliimme on a Friday evening and tell you how exciting it was to their games, "Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St Georgea has often been criticized for the fact that it is a dull team, and Wayne said that he could not care less about.
But now he has a team that will be able to play the kind of played rugby, which we consider to be exciting, especially when he has a speedy young guys.
A haluatkin game to play when you have the type of players.
He brought to the side in 2010, and now he wants to be playing all his tyylistään played rugby - not every team has guys like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, in order to be able to play it.
I think it will be more confident when they say these things, because they are a little bit worried about the gambling against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably have not thought about us vastuksena in important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game was between the Stormin and Roostersien pisterikkaampi than between the Cowboysien Broncosin and finished.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, but I have not seen it yet, but the way it ended? 16-12?
We had these 20 to 18, so we had two more in the paint, but is it exciting played rugby?
Or is it an exciting violation of exploited and the failure to make the mark?
For me, this is about the lines.
If they give us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Stormilla is free this weekend, because they have already won the right to Cowboyseja kotipeliin either North Queensland or Cronulla next Saturday night against the Sharkseja esifinaaliin AAMI Parkissa. Tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.

Arsenal captain Mr Arteta says that joukkuekavereiden must support the injured Jack Wilsherea before the Dinamo Zagreb tasapeliä
Wilshirelle Wenger has also stressed that it is not until September, and assuming that he tailored will go ahead as planned, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In the case of the best Wilshireltä will miss at least the next four in the England game, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will next summer's European championships.
The biggest shame in this latest problem is that the end of Wilsheren last season after the individual nilkkavamman was strong, and he commemorated the old terävyyttään before the beginning of the season.
"This type of disability does not pose a threat to the career," Wenger said.
It is the loser, which is not healed properly.
It is not anything strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his nilkkoihinsa or previous injuries, as he has been.
That may be true in the medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted the player's attempt to return through the middle there is always a risk of lisävammojen.
It is also becoming an uncomfortable model.
Premier Injuries Ltd O2 studies show that there have been 23 different Wilsherellä handicap after he debytoi six years ago.
He has also played for Arsenal during the last five seasons, only 157 liigapelistä 65 game.
The viewing of the broader picture Arsenal after the 2007-08, the period from eight to six, it has been one of the Premier League team, which has lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the opportunity to break the cycle, but the Arsenal believes that their vammatilastoon parannuksensa last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when palaudutaan disability can be prone to the period when the need to strengthen the body and to acquire the competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get it over.
I hope that his body stabilises, I am sure that that will be the case, and that he will get the kind of career than it deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle the teams, when Arsenal will start on Wednesday night in the Champions "League match against Dinamo Zagrebia computers after Chelsea on Saturday" (a) and Tottenham against Hotspuria next Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not followed through our own Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be aloituksessa.
Wenger will also be able to put Kieran Gibbsin and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monrealin and Theo Walcottin.
"I try to maintain the balance and give a breathing space to those nostalgic for the players," Wenger said.
Though Arsenal is a clear jatkosuosikki F-segment, pelottavimpia Maksimirin stadium in Zagreb is in Europe.
Dinamo has not lost a match in 41 after they produced their own "insurmountable" -kampanjansa last season.
The stadium järisytti Tuesday earthquake, which had a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learned from last season in the Champions "League against the Monacoa surrender, and he will be motivated by an increasingly distant dream to lead the team to its first victory of the European Cup.
"This is a huge motivation," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never made it.
We were very close to the year 2006, but on the other hand, parts to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not haaveksijoita.
FriendsFest: Komediasarja, who taught us the serious issues in the friendship between the men
It is striking how similar descriptions are not sarjoissa, especially when you consider that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rate among young men, higher than in the last 15 years.
In 2013, the suicide was the biggest cause of death in 20 to 45-vuotiaissa men in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
The company to tackle the problem of the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced that the men in the year 2015, the aim was to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the meeting this challenge.
In a recent study, there were more than 2000 yläkoulu- and live in a pupil who showed depressive symptoms, according to the study, a person's chance of survival doubled, if sufficiently high prosenttiosa to his friends, was "in a good light."
Similarly, those who were not depressed, the possible emergence of puolittui likelihood of mental health problems, if they were mentally healthy friends.
But in order for the friendship could act, it should be available in the first.
In this period of communication via social media style goes over the content and the välittömyys response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, debonair and have been successful, even though, in reality, is dominated by the isolation.
The success of this surface is dominated by the values that psychologists call the outward: Money, image, social status, and all this is happening within the internal values - the desire for personal growth and friendship - the expense, which will affect a deeper mielenterveyteemme.
And, as the billionaire videopelikehittäjä recently explained, the money is really get a greater happiness.
Frendien hienous was precisely in the fact that it turned the fokuksen on its head.
None of the figures is not defined by their work, but rather their personality, which has shown clearly interacts with friends.
Chandlerin Joeyn and numerous halaukset, tuoleissa joyful moments watching football, Ross ikävöimässä Rachelia - the humour came from the knowledge that, yes, men can identify with all of this, even though they often hesitate to explore their feelings in full.
As the Samaritans organisation vapaaehtoistyöntekijä explained to me: "When I listen to the people who are depressed and suicidal, I really did not understand how the tiniest interaction with your friend can improve the existence."
Often contact us to take the men feel that they cannot talk to your friends.
The old ajatelma "over the horizon" is strong, as well as the feeling that if you open up the problems, will be seen as weak.
A Frendit is one of those that comes to mind when I try to provide longer term about how we cope with it.
It highlighted the friendship between the men in the small moments.
Although the neutral, external position to the other end of the phone to help people in moments of despair, a veteran assistance will be especially, a private network of family and friends.
And so, if one takes part in Comedy Centralin FriendsFestiin this weekend, and all the kuvauspaikat is planned in honour of the occasion, coffee Central Perkiin mikset would take time.
Or, better still, if indeed Starbucksissa someone's solitary, there and welcome.
You can never know how much ystävyytesi can be labelled.
Frendit Comedy Centralilla will be sent from beginning to end, all 236 period, taking part in the 'FriendsFest' apartheid

We wanted to win and we won, even though the harmittelenkin we managed to make one or two more paint.
Ibrahimovic came back after being injured in one of the three pariisilaisjoukkueeseen change after the team fell to 2-2-tasapeliin League 1's kotipelissä Bordeauxia received over the weekend, but he was left in the fourth minute, Di Maria in the shadows.
When he moved to Manchester Unitedista last month, was named man of the Argentinean laitahyökkääjä, which deprives PSG's new level in Europe, and he proved why, when Marco Verrattin ran onto the ball behind the exploited Malmö and then hit a beautiful completion of Johan takakulmaan Wilandin over the network.
However, if someone waited for PSG from easy and big profits, he was disappointed.
Malmö tukkoinen was the opponent, it won the Celticin ratkaisuottelussa in reaching this stage, its avauskentällisessä has nine international players and viisimiehinen defence, as well as two players in deep keskikentällä.
But the team did not provide hyökkäyspuolella is little more than a minute 34. laukauksen Djurdjicin Nikola, which went for glory over Kevin Trappin maalitolpasta.
Instead, stranded between the PSG had lost due to the completion of the bad syöttöjen and Ibrahimovicilta in particular, which failed in a total of five companies in just the first at half-time and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in the inside right at the beginning of the second puoliajan kosketuksesta Ibrahimovicin.
He was, however, a much more effective when they refer to their colleagues, and just Ibrahimovicin kierrepotkun syötöstä Di Maria was sent off, which went in 52. Wilandin maalitolpan around for a minute.
The second goal came an hour after the game at the end of the season in the sixth that hit uruguaylaisen maalinsa thanks to Cavan after Ibrahimovic was Maxwell's ristisyötön näpäyttänyt forward from the left.
It had ended the hopes of Malmö to get back into the game, and only in the fight against the brilliant David Luizin Wilandin direct potkusta loppunumerot was down before the finish of Ezequiel Lavezzin become was rejected just at the end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide admitted later that PSG were one level higher than his team, the Norwegian said: "The Champions" League of these Viimeisein was in December of last year. "
Since then, we have only played in the league of Sweden, which is not the same level.
Karsintaottelut will not be enough.
I would like to cap Pariisille.
It was a great game from them.
