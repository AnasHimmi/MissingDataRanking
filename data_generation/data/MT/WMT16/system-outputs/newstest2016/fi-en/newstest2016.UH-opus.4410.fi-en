As his teacher admits shooting his girlfriend during a 911 call
Voice only slightly coloured university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the emergency call to the police that he shot his girlfriend and that police will have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "Golden Dog" is alive and probably upset, and said that the dead woman's next of kin contact details can be found on this phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and notebook to the side, a handwritten message: "I'm so very sorry I wish I could undo this, I loved her and she's the only woman who has ever loved me," said the letter, which is signed by experts, according to lamb.
There was nothing to suggest that the lamb, who taught two online course in Minnesota, Delta State University in Cleveland, had already traveled nearly 500 miles to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, this office door.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford told the university staff heard about the shooting at 10.18.
He said Lamb called fateful 911 Call for some time after that.
By the end of the day the death toll rose with one more: lamb committed suicide äntä surrounded by police.
Authorities are still trying to figure out motive lamb the day after pupils and staff must have school shootings because of hiding behind locked doors.
Investigators on both sides of the state have published information according to which the students and staff of the Lamb described as a gifted teacher, which, however, may have been a problem.
The students told me they expected his hours.
Prentiss, kuolinpaikkakunnan gautierin, police say that the lamb had a violent past or a criminal record.
Schmidt himself was incorporated into his lamb wrote a book, in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both had taught social sciences and history department, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended the training courses for both men.
On the other hand, was the sight of some of the problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers said Lamb, but also said that he seemed nervous and agitated, as if something had been wrong "ikään. "
The second student Mikel Sykes said Lamb told him that he had a lot of stress in the academic year to 15 at the end of 2014.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State universitysta, saying that he was some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online course.
Recent changes in the university pay principle means that, although the lamb had worked so hard to get his doctorate in front, it does not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professor posts.
The university provost William Laforge said that no lamb between Schmidt and she knows she's no contradiction, but that "clearly in Lamb's mind was something."
These are the questions that lamb is no longer able to respond.
After Lamb had fled the campus, the police got on his trail, when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas State.
Before he was arrested, lamb, shot himself with a .38 pistol in a house in the back yard approximately one and a half miles south of his parents' house in Mississippi, a suburb of Greenville, told the Washington County coroner methel Johnson.
Lamb, the car was still in the running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why the Lamb went to this particular house, although Johnson said that he believed that the Lamb knew people who live there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started work at the university in 2009, and taught geography and science education, university has 3,500 students and is located in the city, which is about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed a doctorate in science education in the spring.
One of the lamb's old friend describes him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston told me he was 15 years old and the lamb is 20 years old, when they met through a mutual friend.
Hairston and his friend was in high school, and the lamb was nice, older guy, who tried for many years to teach hairstonia play the guitar.
He was quite the charmer in those days.
All the girls were putty in your hands, when he was at the scene told me, now 40 years old, Hairston, who lives in a Jackson suburb in brandonissa.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been seeing each other for a while.
In the emergency call Lamb told me that he killed his wife, but for their marriage and there is no evidence.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the river in a brick house gautierissa.
The police told me the dog is fine.
Prentiss's former husband Shawn o'steen told me they divorced 15 years ago, but remain friends, they now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"he is very upset," o'steen described her daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'steen told me that he hadn't met a lamb, but was heard from his daughter Abigail, that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss, when Lamb and Abigail were both performing at the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together a few gigs.
O'steen told me that his daughter is doing and sing his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a number of online businesses.
Gautierin lighting of a bar near the Rome Julep bartender and occasional entertainment organizer Mike Shaffer, says he saw that lamb and Prentiss last September 5 the night before, when the lamb was done with his guitar and harmonica performance for the low number of visitors.
Nothing seems to be wrong.
"just a happy couple," he said.
We were just goofing around and throwing one-liners at each other.
So they were both quite clever.
The dead teacher Schmidt led the first year students seminar programme and is a specialist in Indian and colonial history, a high school English teacher told me don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Kansas Emporia State University, and was his fraternity and the student government puheejohtaja.
Tuesday night in Cleveland at the Delta State campus, held a candlelit prayer, which was attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Mass, during which the university choir sang songs of bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson continues on Wednesday.
"we're trying to get students to come back," Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time for the healing process.
Amy reported from Mississippi and Rogelio Solis in Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus of Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
Story has been corrected, according to the police now say Lamb called Schmidt's 911 call after the shooting, and that even if the lamb was referring to a call during the prentissiin as his wife, there is no evidence that they were married.

8 poll survey result showing that Donald Trump is serious about
Some have tried to label him as a weather vane.
Others see him as just a joke.
Part of the waiting for the collapse.
Although some Republicans are trying to get Donald Trump out of the approval ratings polls, the top priority, it is not (yet) failed.
In 11 of the last national survey in a decade, Donald Trump has been leading in the numerical figures, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for real estate opportunities for the nomination of the king.
Election season is only in its early stages.
These results do not mean that Trump is likely to be the Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing its lead to the rise of Herman Cain, neither of which got in behind any of the state in the nomination process.
It is also a lot of reasons why we should be a problem for him in the general election.
Outside groups, such as Jeb Bush's super PAC and the conservative organization Club for Growth, however, we have taken note of Trump's persistence and beginning to use their resources in order to topple him.
Following the recent approval ratings survey results do not suggest that the real estate King is only a passing phase:
Trump suosittuus figures have done a U-turn.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University Polling surveys showed that only two of the 10 Republicans welcomed the real estate King.
By the middle of July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52%.
Currently six out of 10 Republicans React to Donald trumpiin positively.
About three in 10 say that they are negative.
These figures are accurate in the first primary state.
In a survey carried out by the University of quinnipiacin in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they have a positive attitude to trumpiin.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be satisfied if the Trump should be a candidate.
In the CNN / orc:n poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "satisfied" or ""innostuneita, if Trump is the candidate.
Only two out of 10 said that they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson to roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% ""innostuneita vs. Trump 40%).
The next highest cause of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio by just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters are "dissatisfied" or "upset" if the rulers of favorite Jeb Bush would be the nominee.
Trump's fiery temper is not a problem for the majority of Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been criticised widely for his bombastic speeches and insults, in Monday's ABC News / Washington Post poll, 52 percent to Republican leaning voters on the national level, I think that's the real estate King is the president for the universal nature of the quality.
In quinnipiacin last week, according to a survey of the first meeting of the party in the state of Iowa chapter is the same: 52% of Republicans think that the trumpilla is for leaders agreed the quality of character.
ABC / Post poll shows 44%, however, thinks that his character is not suitable for the president to act, and almost six out of ten is of the opinion that it is not his nature belong to the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think as commentators, they believe that Trump is a genuine alternative.
CNN / orc:n survey, four in 10 had Trump as the most likely alternative to ask who would most likely be appointed as the Republican candidate.
Yet at the end of July, four in 10 supported Jeb Bush.
Information: julkistus in the Republican Party electorate that has not always been at his disposal of the brightest possible crystal ball.
During the last parliamentary term, this time of four out of 10 Republicans felt that Rick Perry will be appointed as a candidate, and only 28% in favour of the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters to Trump's campaign to be credible.
Even if the Republicans will settle in to support another candidate, Trump would win but nearly every one of them.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to the Trump lead, because contrary to Trump's support is divided among several other candidates.
Monmouth University, who at the beginning of September, the survey showed, however, that in a hypothetical race between Donald Trump and almost all the other Republican candidates, Trump gets majority support in almost all cases.
He leads by 13 points, Carly fiorinaa Marco rubiota by 14 points, Walker had 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and Rand Paul, Chris Christie and John kasichia each with 33 points.
He is in the positions of the Ted Cruz.
Only Trump the winning candidate?
If you set them against each other, Ben Carson, businessman Donald Trump would win by a large margin of 18 points.
Barely a majority of Donald Trump supporters have been told to make a decision.
A new CBS / nyt:n poll for Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of Trump voters have decided who to their voice goes.
The situation could of course change, no one can be fully sure to say that he would never change his mind.
46% said they may switch candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment, is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision, are two times more likely to be Trump's side.
Six of the 10 Republican says that we have to agree with Trump on immigration.
Since then, two months ago Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his opening campaign speech, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some people are worried that Trump's bombast to drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and damaging uudelleenbrändäysyrityksiä.
In his Monday published a new ABC / Post kyselytutkimuksen, six in 10 Republicans say Trump is agree with immigration issues.
So, it appears that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of the Republican electorate, due in large part to their status outside the policy.
Six out of 10 Republicans said Monday ABC / Post survey, that they prefer to opt for an external policy person than someone with government experience.
They are also angry at the federal government.
Two weeks ago, Des Moines Register / Bloomberg survey of Iowa showed that three of the four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% is "unhappy" and 21 percent "really angry."
Jeremy corbynin debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
The corbynin appearance on Question Time has been eagerly awaited since her election
The Labour of the Labour Party's new leader, Jeremy Corbyn, David Cameron for the first time at Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn rises to ask his first of six questions a little after noon, and it is likely that the media and the Labour party MPs are watching him closely their performance.
Corbyn has called for this weekly show "less drama and more facts."
He has also said, that could leave some of his colleagues the opportunities for treatment.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test for corbynin leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government, and he spoke of the central organization of trade unions in the annual meeting on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour Party leader's decision to stand silent as the national anthem during the Tuesday memorial service, which took place from the Battle of Britain during World War II. 75 anniversary, has sparked criticism of the Conservative Party in representatives of the people and has been reported in several front page stories.
Corbynin decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbynin representative said his "stand respectfully quiet" and that he was "in recognition of the bravery of the British Royal Air Force air war."
Corbynin shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, said to the BBC Newsnight programme -twon, that he should be called on the Labour leader to sing the national anthem, despite the fact that he thinks the house should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow minister has refused to be involved in the corbynin's inner circle on the grounds of differences, economic, defense and foreign affairs in the first place, less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supports him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences concerning the alignment of the party's role in the European Union and government assistance have also been building up on the roof, "" the Labour Party within corbynin since the appointment.
Corbyn said at the meeting of the central organization of trade unions, the Labour party put forward the amendment, which would remove the whole roof.
Hours later, the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, Smith said that the party was "very clear" about it, that they only oppose the government's plans to reduce the ceiling from £26,000 to £23 0000.
To be the fifth Corbynista Labour Party leader, David Cameron, has faced in the last decade, at a time when he has been leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Party leader, has promised a new approach to politics, and now says that he is "mass recentimprovementsin" ideas for questions to the prime minister, and received more than 30 000 proposals.
The Islington North MP Corbyn has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time, knowing the nature of the opposition is too variable and that he intends to abstain as well as for witty repartee that sniping promised instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn said that the shadow of the government's Economic Secretary Angela Eagle works at his stand in for question time, when Corbyn is not involved - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also proposed that also other colleagues can sometimes be given to speak, and he has said he approached the president of the House of Commons, John bercowia, issue.
When Cameron rose to the leadership of 2005, he said, that he wants to move away from such political theater, which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but he later had to admit their failed.
Since then, when it was televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important indicator of the discretion of the president, his ability to control of the House of Commons, and his position on the other representatives of the people, although critics have criticised the Question Times that they have become the only travesty which requires far-reaching reforms.

Metcash start a grassroots campaign to Aldin sector against intrusion
Metcash is trying to protect from the IGA kauppojaan Aldin invasion of Southern and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the IGA traders market share in the south and western Australia Aldin $700 million before the attack.
Aldi is preparing two distribution centre and the first store opening early next year in the south and Western Australia, which is on the way up to 120 trade. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarketit strengthen its relations with local food with intermediaries and build IGA brand mainstream and social media marketing and events, such as the Adelaide Show, through the exhibition.
Iga:n merchants and suppliers have jumped in, and brands such as the future of the ice cream manufacturer dunsborough'sta simmo's offer samples in stores, and shop owners iga:n sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their stock customers.
Metcashin is expected to reveal more details about his defense strategy on 29 September, when this food, alcohol, and hardware wholesaler hold annual Investor Strategy days.
There is much at stake, since the Southern and Western Australia a total of almost 30 per cent of IGA metcashin shops area, and its profit margins are higher than those of the Eastern Länder metcashin IGA network.
In the southern and western Australia shopping visitors are notoriously parochial, and a lot of it is in retailers iga:n greater market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24 percent in the West compared to the eastern states with 14%.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi get about 5% of the land in these two food market within 12 months of the opening of the first movement, the turnover from all actors, but mainly from independent retailers.
In its report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that iga:n retailers may lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi to open next year in the South West, 25 and 30 move, which produces 500 and 600 million dollars in turnover in these areas.
In food and food sales and the loss of metcashin high fixed costs base can pay metcashille approximately $13 million operating profit losses before interest and tax, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash lost market share in eastern states to mainly aldille and Coles, although in a recent Roy Morgan research found that the customers were all loyal iga:n.
As Morgan Stanley believes that metcashin food and food sales dropped by 3% in 2016; 4, 1% in 2017 and 2% in 2018, so that its market share will decline from the year 2015, 14% to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week a leading investment fund manager and founder of Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "may very possibly lose in a decade."
Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Douglass's comments.
However, it is understood that the metcashin member of the government would have taken the last week contacted douglassiin.
Iga:n market share has fallen after 2010 from 18% to 14%, and income from metcashin food and food products business, which cares for about 1,200 IGA Retailer, have fallen 43 per cent after 2012. This is about the activities of debt financing and the reduction in sales and margins are under pressure.
Wholesalers, however, need to assert themselves, and has invested each year to more than $150 million on a weekly basis for the calculation of the prices of the products to the same level and with the help woolworthsin Coles, IGA retailers renovate stores increasing the fastest growing fresh food, as well as its bringing to market a better range of private label products.
Metcashin CEO Ian Morrice says that price cuts and improving the stores have added to the appeal, and he hopes that the wholesaler profits go back to the path of growth in 2017, the first time in four years.

In the name of the so-called "special" see the talented young duo of Kokkinakis forced unwillingly into the public domain about the incident, in which Kyrgios upset Stan wawrinkaa Montreal Masters in the competition.
Soon after, in a spicy qualifying match in Cincinnati, the judge twice had to separate the kokkinakisin and his opponent Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared: "wawrinkan should have beat Kyrgios, and I should beat this kid."
While Kokkinakis was last seen smashed his bat after the cramp ruined his possible triumph of Richard gasquetista in U.S. Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of the kokkinakisin.
Right now the young man is in Glasgow to compete with Sam grothin From Another Place in kaksinpeleissä tomicin with Bernard in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I'm pretty firmly of the opinion that Thanasi has just pulled into the fray," Healy said.
He broke his bat when she loses because of a cramp in the U.S. Open, but he is not the first player who breaks his bat in frustration, and I can feel my thanasin well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But he has behaved extremely well, even in quite a provocative situations in the U.S. Open with Harrison, and so on and so forth, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been a bit harshly.
He is very mature for 19 years of age, he works hard to fit in to the team and so on and so forth, and he has never had problems with the other players, he is held in high esteem in the locker room, he trains hard, is in good shape and is very calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged on its merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take the kyrgiosta according to Friday starting important games, describing this as a "joint decision" all proper solutions, but still support a return to regular canberralaisen team rolling.
"we want the team to be fully focused on the game and not all controversy [kyrgiosin] around," Healy said.
And Nick has increased very rapidly, as, for example, Federer and Murray have pointed out, and she's growing up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves everything they get kritisismin. However, we try to support him, we try to help them understand the consequences of their actions, and I believe that is the best thing for both him and the team, if he spends some time away from the public eye to these consequences.
The European migration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closed borders, arresting immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern borders against Serbia arrested those who tried to enter the country illegally, and the aim is bottled in the country of the future flow of immigrants.
At the border, followed by chaos as hundreds of people flocked to the neutral zone, and the Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who fled the violence in their own countries, have now set up their tent and settled for an indefinite period of time to stretch of road control posts between the two countries.
However, the frustration grew.
The police helicopter to stay above them immigrants this chanting "Open the borders!" and yelling insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Serbian foreign minister, declared that it is "unacceptable" return of migrants in Hungary, when they arrive all the time more from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not causing injury to civilians.
The debate must take place during the next few days, the other countries and with Brussels, "Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Chaos on the border between Hungary and Serbia was born after 28 nationality Group failed in creating a common immigration policy, contradictory in a meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agree on the distribution of responsibilities of 40 000 people seeking asylum, which have now been taken over by Italy and Greece. The ministers spoke optimistically of a final agreement being reached in the next month or next year - by the end of it, what the EU countries take 120,000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Austrian demand on Tuesday for next week an extraordinary EU summit to discuss the continent's migration crisis.
Hungary did not put her hope in the fact that its neighbors or Brussels would work in the near future.
A state of emergency Tuesday in two southern region gave authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and made it possible, that you can be closed and asylum law can be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now, when the fence on the Serbian border is ready, the country also intends to erect a barbed wire fence part of its border with Romania to halt the flood of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the inmates had been recruited to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months from Hungary has become a major bottleneck and point of entry to the European Union for refugees, many of whom are on the run from the war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has however claimed that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, or fleeing from war, who are entitled to the protection of this view is strongly at odds with other EU countries, including Germany, with.
The new laws, which came into force in the middle of the night in Hungary, now defined as a crime or damage the company exceeds about 4 meters (13 feet) barbed wire fence, which the government has built for the Southern border against Serbia, and include long prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"mass immigration caused by the situation of the Hungarian government to declare a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the southern city Szeged.
We are in fact very clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament must still formally next week expected to approve the military positioning, but Associated Press journalists on the border have already seen for days, heavily armed military personnel and their vehicles and his dog.
Orban, homeland security advisor, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that the authorities had caught up with 45 people when he tried to cross the border, as well as 15 already further down time.
They got more than damaging the fence, the police are now imprisoned, and they are accused of offences as defined in the new law.
Authorities quickly fix the fence.
Hungarian officials also shut down on Tuesday morning from two of the seven crossing from the Serbian border, after they were sent out with barbed wire covered with rail-wagon close to one of these places.
The main border crossing near the Hungarian roszkea covered in chaos, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal trunk for the treatment of the people and the crowds tried to cram in.
About 20 your head in, but thousands of people were left on the outside.
A group of migrants blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they will refuse food and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
In the 2016 elections: national survey, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders has narrowed the lead side
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead in the nomination race kaksinumeroisessa Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders catching up to him.
Clinton now supports Democrats (47% of voters, down from 58%), and the second is Sanders supports increased from 27 per cent (17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced if he leaves in the presidential race, but he's worth 15% of Democrats in the electorate.
More than five months before the primaries began, the majority of Democrat voters, finds that it is still too early to say that they had decided who to vote for.
Clinton supporters are standing behind their own choice but more than supporters of the other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen a number of population groups in last month's CBS News poll after poll, and at the same time, Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is firmly in charge of women and moderates, but his lead has narrowed.
His popularity among men has declined dramatically, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton head start in less than 50 years of Democrat voters are gone, and he is now neck and neck with Sanders.
Clearly, however, Clinton leads among older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders by double digits on the Liberals, but now Sanders leads this team by five percentage points.
Around half of the Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she becomes the nominee of the party.
A quarter say they support him with reservations, and 15% support him just because he is a candidate.
6% don't support him at all.
It is hardly surprising that the current Clinton supporters are very likely to be enthusiastic in his support.
Opinions are mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton, only a quarter of those support him enthusiastically.
That's what 48 percent of Democratic voters say they support Clinton, Republican enthusiasm about the first man on the same Donald Trump says fewer Republican voters (35%).
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him as a candidate, the most popular answer was that he has the right experience (16%). After this, the most popular answer is that now is the right time for a female president (13%) and the fact that he is the best candidate for the job (10 per cent).
Clinton supporters also mentioned her connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions as well as the possibility of being elected was also mentioned.
Because the vice president seems to a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of Democrat voters would like to see him in the race - even if it is a third disagree.
Democrats ask voters who they choose in the second of the party nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half said that they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue the Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton, the Sanders grows. If Biden goes along, management is 20 percentage points, but if he is opting out, the figure is 30.
55% of Democrat voters believes that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential elections, but this figure, however, is down from last month's 78%.
By this yardstick Biden lags far behind, but their share of the vote, who like him has increased.
When Democrats voters asked what is the most important in a candidate, but they brought the opinions äänestettävyyden ahead.
Also last month, one Democratic candidate or potential candidate was not considered a possible candidate for these voters.
Democrats candidates or potential candidates are doing well in certain key issues his party among voters.
The vast majority have to Clinton, Sanders and bidenia as honest, trustworthy and a strong leader.
Biden doing the best trio in honesty, while Clinton is the strength of leadership.
30% of voters say that the Democrats do not consider Clinton honest and reliable, which is two times more than Sanders (15%), while 27 percent said that they have no opinion of Sanders.
Democrat voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically on the same page.
When you look at all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters say that they have no opinion of Sanders.
If Hillary Clinton's personal email address and server operating as foreign minister he's still raise questions, the vast majority of the Democrat voters are satisfied with his explanation of the issue and says that it does not affect their public opinion of him.
However, the matter is different, if you look at America as a whole.
Half of the American population is now dissatisfied with her explanation, and only about one-third are satisfied.
The people divided in March, shortly after it came to light.
The vast majority of Americans say that the e-mail controversy affected their opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six in 10 Republicans said that their opinion of Clinton has changed for the worse.
Even though Clinton's own party voters to keep them honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters, only 32% to keep them honest and reliable, and this figure has dropped 8 percentage points from last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that you do not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters in the whole country, nor should trump an honest and reliable.
Both Trump and Clinton, however, is regarded as a good leader.
Of the six studies with bachelor's bidenia, Carson and Bush are the most honest.
As a general rule, Sanders is honest, but not many people have an opinion about him, just as no carsonistakaan.
The margin of error in the study, which included 351 Democrat voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson Closing in on Donald Trump in national poll
Donald Trump, Ben Carson comes close to the new CBS News / New York Times survey
Two candidates collected in the new poll, half of all the votes, leaving the other fighting for footing.
Republican voters across the country, still strongly support Trump, whose approval rating has risen from the previous, prior to last month's Fox News Election debate on the CBS poll, 23% in a poll published on Tuesday 27%.
Carson, however, at the same time dramatically increased from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups, with higher education and is ousting Trump among Republican voters.
The rest of the field are lagging behind, with the exception of Carly fiorinaa and Ohio Governor John kasichia. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's approval rating has fallen: most of last month's 10% to the current 2%.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are tied in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in this latest, in September, the survey of 376 Republican voter sample is + / - 6%.
Last week published the latest CNN / orc:n poll showed in Carson is rising in the polls: he has a 19% approval rating among Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him at 32%.
Also in the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll shows Trump was significantly above Carson.
Carson's popularity rises in the last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon apologized for nothing, even though the Carso trump faith should be challenged.
"we need energy," Trump said last Saturday at a campaign visit to Iowa.
Of the five fraternity members accused Baruch College the first year student death
Nearly two years after that, when a student died in a fraternity hazing ceremony in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains region, the murder case has been brought against five people.
In New York City, located at the University of Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity members went to Chun "Michael" Deng was brutally attacked in membership during the rite, in September 2013, and that after the delay in his hospital in its export, thereby contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say Deng blindfolded and his back loading more than 13 pounds a bag full of sand, and then repeatedly tackled him to the ground when he tried to walk across an icy field toward the goal.
In the end, Deng complained that his head hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
Fraternity members did not call 911 Deng fainted, but allegedly waited for about an hour before they brought him to the hospital, police said.
They had time to change clothes, however, Deng, looking for online information about their symptoms, and to contact the Brotherhood national chairman to Andy mengiin ask this advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner told me at the press conference.
"this is where members began to hide his ritual equipment and therefore, in practice, the Brotherhood ahead of the welfare of Michael Deng, the chief of police," Wagner said.
Dengiä could not revive, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report Deng got repetitive blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"too many families have suffered from the fraternity hazing, when every year at least one student is dead as a result of always since 1970," Doug Fierberg, an attorney representing the family of Deng, said in a statement.
Brotherhood and their members must be held to account by the authorities, and this is an important step.
The Monroe County grand jury supported the fact that the first five members receiving third degree murder charges
32 other Brotherhood members, including Meng, are also accused of violent hazing and criminal conspiracy.
"we don't want to be held liable only if the individuals. There is something at the organisation, which accepted the situation, either formally or informally, they must also be held accountable," Wagner said in a Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and national fraternity broke into his connection to the local section.
This is what happens when the US central bank raises interest rates
Raising interest rates will be, and the emerging market rates fall, bond yields will rise and the economy goes into recession.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long this all going or how long it takes.
The past does not give little help on the timing when it comes to the economy.
The recession has taken on the initial drawdown, sometimes after only 11 months, and sometimes has gone as long as 86 months.
The US central bank's aggressive in raising interest rates is often, though not always, the determining factor in terms of how to react to the economic and financial resources.
That's why the US central bank officials have been so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on the fact that as interest rates start to increase, but mostly to the normalisation of the situation going into the development lifecycle.
The equation is indeed a number of variables.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all of the increase in the interest rate associated with the fuss has been excessive.
"the central bank's first increase since the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as" cheap money "the end of an era," said Capital Economics chief global affairs, economic expert Julian Jessop in a message to customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect that the United States interest rates gradually return to normal, even though the level is still low, such a cataclysmic shock, which many people seem to be afraid of.
However, this does not mean that it will have an impact.
Below is a snapshot of how some sectors of the economy will react to a previous development on the basis of:
As the market has seen in the last month, so the interest rate increase the waiting can make the situation unstable.
When the increase comes from the fact that the effect has not been quite so dramatic.
"it seems that the return on capital has a tendency to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which possibly reflects the time lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the increase of the central bank.
To be more precise, in the last 35 years, so the market is generally strong, in approximately 14% increase as we approach the increase, 250 days after that, the situation is quite flat (average increase of 2.6%), and the normal state is reached 500 days after the average yield of the six in the last cycle, 14.4%, multiplied in the Nuveen Asset Management Company, a leading investment strategist Bob Doll's recent analysis, which was published in the journal Barron's.
Deutsche Bank says the impact on equities is usually clear at a later stage in the upward cycle, when profits start to fall.
The recession is part of economic life, but interest rates often encourage their entry.
In the current situation, the central bank is facing certain challenges which were not in the past, and that may speed up the decline.
This is, in particular, gross domestic product, which will be the closest to their All Time Low level before the central bank interest rate increase.
According to the Deutsche Bank in 1950 after 118 Tests and lifting annual nominal GDP has only twice been less than 4%.
Although the year 2015 second quarter figure was 3.6%, very few people believe that standing when the third quarter has been advanced by 1.5%, tells The Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Raising interest rates in this fragile economic setting, it may be risky, and raises the question of, "is it different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants are prepared for the central bank increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting of the committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economic experts believe that the committee can accept a raise at this meeting, the futures trading anticipates only a 25% probability.
"our research shows that since 1950, all upward cycle have so far appeared to increase the leverage of the super cycle, where GDP has surpassed its peak before the recession very quickly after that, when the recovery has begun," the report says.
On the other hand, now under way has been exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst period of observation.
In the current cycle, the central bank is by far the longest wait on record: the end of the last recession has been to 35 months, and now, is already underway. 74 months.
The standard return has also been a volatile market is expected to increase the interest rate, and the model reminds me of some of the findings made in the capital.
The main difference is that the central bank changes its line, its effects are more in bonds than shares.
Bond yields for the first cycle of alternating direction seems to immediately increase / surgery.
At the end of the cycle of debt yields fall immediately, "Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab, the strategists believe that raising interest rates causes short and long-term bond yields convergence, thus pave the yield curve.
Higher fixed-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, even though "we are still cautious about the search for yield," said Schwab, a fixed income analyst Kathy Jones in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones, believes that the market has already adapted to the alignment of the Central Bank's expectations.
"the strength of the dollar and inflation expectations fall apart there are a number of signs that the market must adapt to tighter monetary policy outlook," he wrote.
Short term interest rates are high, the yield curve is flat, have increased credit spreads and volatility has increased - all these are specific to the market, where the central bank has tightened up their alignment.
In general, companies whose business is mainly in the United States, win, when interest rates rise and the local products should be more attractive.
Multinational companies, which have a lot of debt, are performing worse, when the increase in the dollar makes their products more expensive on world markets and of their debt will be more expensive than what they are funding.
"history shows that" quality "shares generally are more productive after the first rate increase in three months," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Companies with strong turnover, passed the weak turnover companies in 1994, 1999 and 2004, after increases by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies that have a high return on capital and low volatility stocks, shares, performed better than the low quality companies. First, the average was 4 (percentage points) and the latter (3 percentage points).
The debt will be a major problem.
Those companies which have a lot of floating rate debt, we are losing the most, Goldman said.
The stock market speculation on the outside, consumers have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Savers will also be able to make a profit with higher yields, even though the experts take a different view of how quickly the effect feels like.
BBC Radio is a copy of the Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham blames channel "popularise"
He argues that its separation of commercial competitors are becoming more and more difficult
In addition, he took to his target, the BBC Music Awards, prizes, saying that they only imitate the Brit awards prizes

He took in sights including the BBC Music Awards Awards, which launched in December last year.
"last year, I started at the BBC Music Awards seems just a different name of a set-up under the Brit Awards Gala.
So if you're trying to do something different, this is two straight I remember examples of when, in fact, just copy something that already can be found on the market, "Bingham said.
The BBC director general denied the charges, claiming that his BBC Radio 3 is much above commercial rival, when it comes to live music and sharing of information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches such things about classical music, what I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and the music is, in fact, first class.
"in addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to find new music and commissioned new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must do more work than before to reach out to the public, because the British know less about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only part of the BBC offer, which was criticized for a commercial competitors to step on the toes of the Culture, Media and Sport, on the special committee hearing.
The conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, music competition, which the BBC bought from a Dutch production company Talpa Media, according to estimates by 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed, because it is not original and it is not unique in any way?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 Channel programme, which act as a judge Paloma Faith and Boy George, has produced "a very BBC style."
He added that he wants the production company "löytävän success of their own inside the house, "the next time, when it will start a series of entertainment.
However, he did not agree to stop the next few months, the production of The Voice or the fact that the licence payers' money used for other entertainment formats.

B& q-dummy boss says that Eastern European workers are employed on the cheap popularity behind
The Brits still use more favors for men, Veronique Laury says
From Eastern Europe arriving in the trade is behind the increase in the number of men
As a result of professional men targeted Screwfix 200 more shops open
At the same time, Kingfisher closed 60 b& q-dummy stores around the country

The Brits say to give up his hammer and paint brush and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home renovations
It seems that if you are handy with a hammer or a swastika painted on the walls, are now in the minority.
You can see the Brits employ more and more men to take care of Do It Yourself jobs in their homes, says b& Q, behind the company's boss.
Home decorators commercial chain Kingfisher owns the new director general Veronique Laury said, that is behind the popularity of Eastern Europe in the number of skilled workers, and the fact that they offer their services on the cheap.
This leads to the Kingfisher is planning to open 200 new workers to the Screwfix trade and its closed 60 b& q-dummy stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in b& q-dummy shops, because eight out of ten in the store making purchasing is precisely to the fairer sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today, there are more single female households, which make it more home renovation work than before.
Laury said: "the majority of our shops the staff is still a man.
We need to get a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchasing decisions are made by women.

Three aces, the government decided to resort to binding legislation to save the economy of the country.
Too visible effects were pretty fast.
Sak and other employees of the organisations the pointy end began to force right away, and as a result, the country is standing on Friday because of the large-scale demonstrations of workers.
Quite a lot of people think it stands to reason.
Ask whether it is worth to strike, when it goes badly.
Has even set up a resistance.
On the internet, more than 50 000 people have already been reported, does not intend to participate in the demonstrations but goes to work.
The good old consensus this time would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet, where protest, but openly declared a scab a little person would have been political suicide.
Million trade union members in a few tens of thousands of people protest, not a lot of bother, but it gives food for thought.
The role of the trade union movement is no longer so obvious more than twenty years ago.
Not everyone feels the business objectives of their own, values have changed
The attractiveness of the trade union movement from the point of view of the government's drastic solutions can also be seen as a woman as a godsend.
When things have for years shown taxiing under its own weight, so now I finally get to the point in unions or workers rights, conspicuously and defend properly.
The government can thus providing an might want to trade union movement, where membership in the role of the trade unions see perhaps more necessary.
Are the organisations actions no matter what you think, so it is a nonsense, that the Friday demonstrations, the words somehow stop Finland.
Yes Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to fall and unemployment rises.
You'd think all these matters to a head.
At the Lappeenranta University of tough austerity: the aim of 8.5 million savings, personnel reduction 130:lla
Lappeenranta University of Technology to start a savings regimen, which aims to cut costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings the university started the whole staff on YT negotiations, the savings target is an annual 6.5 million.
In practice this means approximately 130 redundancies.
In addition, other activities intended to save $2 million.
Yt negotiations in the background is the 2016 budget, which anticipates the actual operation of the 8.5 million deficit.
It also affected by government budget cuts.
In this financial year the university makes about 2.6 million deficit results.
Costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the Ministry for funding decrease by 2 million and other funding by EUR 2 million.
The university's total budget is around 85 million euros, so the savings target is 10% of the entire budget.
The massive cuts to education and research, as well as a reduction in corporate funding of our universities is very important, "says principal Anneli Pauli University bulletin.
Before the summer perisurgical effects seemed still of a moderate, but now the supplementary funding reduction shows up in a new perspective.
Negotiations with the men the confidence to be launched in the next week on Tuesday and last law imposed by six weeks.
For YLE, the Finnish railways onnibus wants:
Low-cost bus company onnibusin British owner, Sir Brian Souter says to the general that the company aims also to rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in going to the Finnish railway transport.
Stagecoach company is one of Britain's biggest rail companies, Souter says.
Rail transport is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is the shift in the capital city near rural transport in 2017 to 2018.
After passing traffic in the line is long distance transport.
Souter says he already approached the Ministry of Transport.
At the Ministry of Transport held general onnibusin plans to welcome.
On its other international companies interested in rail transport must be notified at least Veolia Transdev (former), which is also in Finland, bus transport and rail traffic in other parts of Europe.
The US central bank must make decisions the interest level
The rest of the world is watching from the sidelines, when the US central bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether they will raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
The Reuters poll of 80 economists to do a little more than half of those who still believe in the last week of the central bank to raise interest rates, now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and kept interest rates at the current 0 to 0.25 per cent level.
This is a historic event, because, when the central bank cut interest rates to zero, is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which the central bank has a chance to get away from the zero level and interest rates begin to normalise, "said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institue for International Economics senior fellow of the Institute.
The US economy has done relatively well, and the recovery has brought balance trillions of dollars and created a little bit of inflation.
The central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global prospects.
It has warned the market that they must be prepared for the increase, but the indications are that they also believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision made public on Thursday at 8: 00 (CET).
Delta State University gunman left apology note
After he shot his girlfriend in the state of Mississippi on Monday morning - before he shot his colleagues later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note in which he said he was "sorry" about the first murder, "and hoped that he could take it back," said authorities on Tuesday.
In the Mississippi Delta, the police told me that the gautierin State University geography and social sciences teacher Lamb called 911 around 10: 00 a.m.
Monday and told me that he has shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant, that police need to send police officers to his home.
He said he "killed his wife last night," and also pointed out that the house is "a sweet dog," which "does not bother anyone," but is probably upset.
Police asked the caller's name, but he didn't tell me that.
Lamb did not give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got to the scene, they found the body of a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss, a 45-year-old lamb handwritten message that read: "I'm so sorry I wish I could take it back.
I love Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me. "
To write a message Lamb drove nearly 500 miles to Delta State, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt, before eventually killed himself late Monday as police surrounded him.
The university provost William Laforge said that no lamb between Schmidt and she knows she's no contradiction, but that "clearly in Lamb's mind was something."
Authorities said Tuesday that, despite the publication of the arguments Monday, the lamb would have thought Prentiss was in relation to Schmidt, did not have "any information or evidence of any kind of" love triangle. "
Shawn o'steen Prentiss told me that she was married to for about seven years and described him as a "good person."
Couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'steen told me that he and prentissillä was 19 years old daughter who is "shocked."
O'steen told me that Prentiss and her daughter were "simply the best of friends."
According to Prentiss Linsday Knowles worked from his home by hand in the Herald Sun online, according to Prentiss Knowles was a close friend.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named lightning, had a relationship with the lamb for about three years.
"he always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb's call to their relatives at some point Monday to tell them that "he's not going to go to jail."
When the police reach Lamb's Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, lamb, stopped his car to the side of the road, left it to it and ran into the woods, where he shot himself in the head.
Lamb argued that science education from Delta state in the spring of 2015, tells of the university website the curriculum vitae.
The Stars, who lost their charm
Actor (left) in a picture with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001 he had leukemia, and in 2009 his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it that he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this really takes a toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw had a double fracture to his right leg lost to PSV eindhovenille Manchester United in the Champions League match.
Although the defender was left in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw could play again this season.
The injury caused a reckless tackle by Hector Moreno 15 minutes after that, when the 20-year-old Shaw had surged to psv:n area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and he had to be given oxygen before taking to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "he has a double fracture of the leg and she is now in the hospital."
Transfer him, maybe tomorrow or the day after that, and then cut back in Manchester.
This is terrible. The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffering from difficulties and after playing brilliantly, and now this happens.
When I was in the locker room, he had an oxygen mask on.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but the double fracture will take at least six months, and he didn't play in the group stage.
I hope that he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli not punished the Mexican players.
Van Gaal suggested that an Italian official was mistaken.
You can judge the situation, when I say that it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad two legs tackle.
Shaw tweeted the following: "thank you to all of you for your message, there are no words to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery starts now, I'm going to come back stronger."
On the subject of Manchester United: Luke Shaw is suffering from a case and loses psv:lle
With an English defenders as a further incentive to recover next June's European Championships in France.
Psv:n coach Phillip Cocu said: "it is a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of such injuries, all are very sad.
As our players are not intended to never insult your opponent.
Moreno broke his leg when he was playing in the Mexican team Van Gaal Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno is taking this really hard, because it is not the intention to hurt an opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it is bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] is to touch it, but I didn't see Luke tackles.
Moreno said to sbs6:lle: "I know what it feels like, I know how difficult these things can be.
I feel terrible for this, I'm so sorry. "
Psv:n Andrés Guardado was taken to the hospital, too, Chris smallingin challenged him.
I guess David Cameron loraxin knows better than this?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it won't be long before we learn that almost by heart.
Except if you're David Cameron.
When holiday childcare services provided from the prime minister asked his favorite children's book, he chose Dr. Seuss book, The Lorax, published in 1971, the Environmental Protection of the story.
The choice was a tough one, Cameron writes in The SuperCamps petroivoire published on the Web site message and continues: "funny, touching, creative, and contains a strong message, I enjoy my read of this book to my children, because it always seems to find a picture or message, which we have not seen before."
All this is true, but the next track, which Cameron supposedly describes the plot, is a summary of the 2012 film version, which was a relatively short original fill added new characters and details.
"within the walls of tarvillen town, where all nature is gone and even the world's trade goods, Ted Boy hopes to win the girl of his dreams to get to the heart of the side fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," the text says, and describes the love story, which in 1991 dead Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, you don't write.
If this is not yet enough suspicious, Cameron's text in some places sounds like it was taken from the Internet Movie Database website found the Lorax movie plot summary, which begins as follows: "within the walls of the city, where everything is tarvillen artificial and even the world's trade goods, Ted Boy hopes to win his dream girl Audrey heart to their side."
Taking into account the fact that Cameron has publicly active older, it seems unlikely that he would be so familiar with the plot, in which a young, unnamed boy hears how local nature is destroyed by the greedy, trees and woven tarviksia Once-ler, regardless of the name given to the story of the short, mustachioed creature of loraxista, who "speaks for the trees."
Such relatively invisible public relations mission is probably outsourced to his aide, who do not appear to have ever read a book 20 times in a row for the children.
The prime minister's spokesman said that the text has become about Cameron's constituency office.
Supercamps confirmed that the text was from Cameron's staff, but no comments on the matter at that time any more.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being on the side of the England team, but it was still a tough place
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates have a tough task, but when you see what kind of Team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think the last series 3-0 loss there was a likelihood of recurrence.
I wouldn't close even vierasvoittoakaan out of the equation.
Alastair Cook's party may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but it involves a good curveball hitters and the team mentality is strong: they don't have the scars from 2012, only the youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali is developing in his curveball and Adil Rashid is the attacker option, even if he is an unknown factor at this level.
The subject: Adam Lyth fell out of the England cricket team, to be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision leaves the team of Adam Lyth is understandably hard to analyze for me, because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against the invaders in challenging circumstances, and simple but the hard truth is that cricket players are judged on their results.
The selection of Joe Root, for example, there was no uncertainty before the release, because, as I have said before, the players are the best choice.
About 100 points higher, and lythin era in team have been able to continue, but he was in charge of their own destiny.
I hope if he gets more home runs, second chance comes to yorkshirelle front.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised lythin attitude, even when he's not performed quite as well as it could have, it does not surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It's hard to answer the question of how long the batter makes a mark on the left.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton got a chance to play at home and guests.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan trottin to Caribbean, Lyth at first when I was in top shape, but it missed the opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales comes along, and it has a batter which I appreciate.
He's a cricketer, it is something which we in Yorkshire we saw early in this season, when he made 236 points against us at Trent Bridge pitch.
You have to give them at least the same chance as the others before him, but this of course depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
Is juggling the idea of opening the batting in the moeenista cook right next to the airport, which can be an extra pitcher, but could keep four quick, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why no batter could hit there, and this left-hander has already shown himself to be a cricketer.
Moeen may not do their duties in their county in worcestershiressa, but he has been to three of them, and in that there is not much difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games before the first wicket fell, moved to the autopsy in 2001.
He did as soon as three hundred points for not remembering the past.
Zafar Ansari will join the team as a replacement pitcher, and, what little I have been in contact with her, she seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his beautiful, amazing statistics - batting average of 31, 35 with the ball and I think that it's a gamble, but there's not too many pitchers and young voters chose.
He learned a lot on this tour.
The team outside the English seems to be a few tough appendix to the side of the coach.
Sri Lankan batsman Mahela jayawardenen appointment as a consultant to the games may prove to be a stroke of genius.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, and brings with it a huge amount of experience, because it is all done in all situations and in all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood will be included in the white ball game, and brings with it a whiff of both energy and ruthless.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it be playing or coaching, and he's got the same brains as exploitable mahelalla.
Sometimes a new voice in the locker room to refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Collyn team of guys from Durham, Ben Stokes, the rest in, given the similar rootille yksipäiväisissä to break against Australia and I do not have, at least, there's no problem with this.
Although not all agree with the coaches, and chose not to do a timetable.
And we must remember that the players, just like their job depends on results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
As a British departure from the EU (Brexit) support can take the profits, if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron a half-assed uudelleenneuvottelustrategiat British in the EU should be forced from day to day, to a still larger problem, even if not taken into account even heartfelt, Jeremy, "Is that a yes or a no?" corbynin selection to the Labour Party or the leadership of the central organization of trade unions angry for Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also has its own corbyninsa and nigei faragensa.
European diplomatic friend recently explained that, because the EU is so deep in the various crises, not all of which is their fault, some member states are tired of British self-centered agenda, which is full of divisive and disruptive changes in the contract concessions, which, for the most part, these countries do not want to.
In its annual meeting in Brighton, the central organization of trade unions decided that it does not want them, if they are eroding social protection.
We could even call it a Dave and George selfieagendaksi.
Prime Minister and finance minister late on the summit or in foreign capitals held bilateral meetings, take a picture of themselves in front of the memorial to the famous local civic leader either with or without him, and then come home, saying that winning support for the reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to look outwards to the British inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with the French," said the Berlin - propose that certain capitals of short-sighted ministers and officials are now in a position that they don't care about our ice and then leaving.
Careful and prudent German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his post before it goes to ruin in the same way as happened for too long without delay Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and kohlille (16).
The French françois-vincent hollandella is ahead of re-election or replacement in 2017.
He, too, is out of power.
The point may be nationalistic right-wing government in Spain, the leftist.
It's hard to see this country sacrifice selfiebrittien for when their energy should rather redirect to prevent that, Scotland is not the source of the United Kingdom - they don't want to do the same because of it's own separatist tendencies.
So, my friend, some of these ministers can even design deliberately useless comments to the Scottish National Party in the style of Great Britain in 2017, the referendum campaign during Brexit to speed up the process.
"the renegotiation was a setup" and "uudelleenneuvotteluilla was not mean anything to Britain."
The Europeans have had a bitter experience, how greedy Fleet Street press can be and how the EU dictator are skeptical of the press, which it is not in the Tony Benn inspired the 1975 referendum, when we started in 1973 as a membership was confirmed by the ratio of 2: 1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the biggest euro opportunist, who made a name for himself by writing about his "direct EU banana" is as a Brussels correspondent in the early Nineties.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
He belonged to a motley bunch of taxes guest rascal, phone was hacked foreigners and persons who are domiciled elsewhere in name and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought of them exactly the same way, but I realized that if you are horny in a cage with the gorilla, the banana is a diversion, because if you don't want to be that of a gorilla, and later still the lunch menu at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was blairilaisempi like Blair himself, when it comes to resisting Cameron uudelleenneuvottelutempun. Bair was in fact agreed to the principle behind the EU constitution, rejected by French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press is not given to him that either never forgive.
But it's nice to Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me kindly in the back with the Westminster Parliament House on Monday (said to him that he does not have any more time to waste on me), appears to be in danger of being taken over by Neil Kinnock, the 1980s boycott Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake, and then that now.
Even though it may take some time, however, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to communicate to the media, not to me, but there is no doubt that to Andrew Marr on the BBC sofa Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbynin official status in Europe is, to put it politely, evolving.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, the majority of the people of the United Kingdom Independence Party Ukip war paint and the enthusiasm of the Conservative Party in fierce nationalists outside can certainly stand behind this opinion.
"Hilary Benn, but not Benn fan" Benn said this in the TV and radio this week, when his inner Boy Scout would have to admit that the choice of rugged corbynin appointed John McDonnell as the shadow government, the finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his dad on TV, trying hard to be disloyal to the Labour Party without their government colleagues that without going so far as to lose the seat of government.
Hillary hard were more attractive.
But the battle to stay involved "in a situation where its good" - Benn phrase - wasn't that what, McDonnell said, and from the looks of it what Corbyn told peers and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever it is, it is hierarchical, emotional and personal image, the Corbyn wants to convey (remember, that he even touched me), communications, discipline is important in an era of 24-hour TV, social media, and in particular in the vortex, which is a breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, by allowing him to keep the Labour party support in the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins seems to think so.
But McDonnell and corbynin basic circles regarding membership of the EU (and line their intellectual Benn regulated their economic and anti capitalist with the past) is no longer just a abstruse debate of left-wing dissidents on the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma of the legal bickering.
When it comes to his duality about NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby siitäm campaigned his donation), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why the Paris or Berlin might want to waste political capital (they have a suspicious voters) to make concessions to Britain, when it could be completely unnecessary?
The United States has been somewhat disappointed at the poor performance of the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, and even cut the cost of a Conservative government was in power, as we have been reminded in Monday British Influence security forum starting safety forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England Electronic Cigarette budget
Investigators have said that the agency financed by the state, the argument that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional, had started 12 of the spirit of the meeting, in which the majority had links to the tobacco industry.
The British Medical Journal (BMJ), was written by experts shared lancetiin criticised Public Health England (PHE) used evidence in its report on the electronic cigarette.
PHE published its this "milestone" report last month described it as "a comprehensive overview of the evidence."
Many scientists, however, have questioned the sustainability of the information referred to the links and some experts and the tobacco industry.
Medical periodical The Lancet published last month in the editorial, which attacked phe:n main conclusion of "exceptional" on shaky ground.
The other two bmj:ssä write researchers have wondered whether claims were "Built On Rock or Sand."
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine School of Public Health professor Martin McKee of the University of Liverpool's Clinical epidemiology Simon Capewell, professor of Public Health said: "the main principle is that the policies should be set up to prove the effectiveness."
They say that the public expect that phe:n "nykyisen claim the best estimate according to electronic cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes, "based on the evidence, detailed assessment and modelling.
In fact, it will be one of the 12 people meeting, which developed monikriteeripäätösanalyysimalli (MCDA) synthesizing their opinions of the harm associated with different products containing nicotine, and the outcome of this meeting concentrated on research.
Mr.mckee. Capewell and say that one of the meeting sponsors was the company nimelä EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director told previously received funding from the Bristish American Tobacco Company for independent research.
He also supported the bat:in Public Health powers in the sustainability report, he said.
One of the 12 people reported that it had received funding from the tobacco manufacturers, but it is not the funding, which he had previously said the tobacco company Philip Morris International Night, he added.
Panel members of the selection criteria, but they don't tell you the panel includes several well-known electrical tobacco supporters, some of whom also say in their study received funding from the sector.
In second place is are not known for their asiantuntijuudestaan in Tobacco Control.
The meeting was attended by director also phe:n tobacco.
The group produced research "talking a lot", admits that there is a lack of "undisputed evidence regarding the disadvantages in the majority of products and large part of the criteria," McKee and Capewell writes.
None of these links or restrictions does not mention the phe:n report.
McKee and Capewell say phe:n claims that "so far there is no evidence that the electronic cigarette acts as a route into smoking for children or non smokers" is premature.
Phe:n Health and Welfare Director Professor Kevin Fenton said that, in the bmj:ssä arguments made have been answered in the past.
He says: "electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Half their lifetime smoking will die of their addiction.
All the evidence points to the fact that the electric cigarette health risks are relatively small, but we have to continue the long-term impact of the investigation.
The obligation to inform the audience phe:llä is clear about what evidence looks like and what it doesn't look, especially when compared to the relative risks of tobacco is so much in the public domain of knowledge.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from diseases related to smoking and smoking costs the nhs:lle each year of £2 billion.
Explaining the current evidence - i.e. even if electronic cigarettes are not risk-free, they are only a tiny fraction of the disadvantages of the traditional tobacco upstock our national responsibilities.
The BBC should give up on eastendersistä, says former Channel 4 chairman
The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should be discontinued in programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice transmission, and that commercial competitors "antaisivat whatever "about such hits as, for example, the Albert Square Street located soap series.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programmes to which other British broadcasters do not do.
From the BBC, he criticised the fact that it puts the public service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, broadcasting to the tricky time against such competitors look at programs and channels, like bbc4.
After that, when the BBC director general Tony Hall said the company wants to make more cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said, that he tried to Channel 4 for a period of six years to create a relationship with the BBC, to no avail.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC produces and sends programmes which will be clear to the subsidized competitors," Johnson said to the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its investigation of the BBC's future.
If the holding of the licence fee - I am not sure that would be the media or the long term, a good idea - it should at least limit its production to such programmes, which the others do not and that.
The voice will be sent to the most important mission for the future of the time, because it wants to gather as much support as possible.
The idea that no one else seems to, is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why you should be a regressive tax to finance programmes, which also could be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one of EastEnders and the other one, admittedly, taken inside the house.
Frankly, the other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand how it is a matter of public service broadcast.
I don't think that it would weaken the BBC at all. "
Channel 4:ä between 2004 and 2010 led to a serial entrepreneur, Johnson said that the BBC is guilty of viewing the hunting "targets because of the people who work there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular series like The former tech-sky leader Tony ball Comments. He used in the 2003 MacTaggart Lecture in Edinburgh to propose that the BBC sell series such as Eastenders.
Johnson said that the smaller the audience, the BBC public service programmes to "menevät bbc4:lle, which is often not possible to measure the audience, but the BBC fulfils its responsibilities and may then £2.4 billion licence fee revenue in defence of hypocrisy, saying that "of course, we are doing all this unknown programmes, which no one is looking." '
They put him in place to broadcasters, which no one will ever see them.
The licence fee for the Johnson said to the committee: "I challenge you to find a regressive system in it, who gets the most from it's worth.
Of course you all think, we all think that the 150 quid a year buys a lot of value, but I don't know is it true to those people for whom £150 is a lot of money, because they do not use the BBC too much.
The former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should reassess its Reith temporary mission "to inform, educate and entertain."
He said that only a small part of the BBC production now classified as training - he said the figures are 1% of the TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and that it should take inspiration from Australia and Canada broadcasting and changes made to "inform, educate and entertain."
When it comes to partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should concentrate more on Proms events such as concerts, which he said will be shown in a television just a few, and team up with commercial companies, so that this all should be considered in the network.
"voting" in the genetics of brain cells to control the sound waves through
In the video, showing how the nematodes changing direction as soon as voting subimpulse hits them.
Researchers have increased the worms, which have been genetically modified neural systems, so that they can control the sonic eruption.
Tiny nematodes changing direction as soon as it hits the impulse, which is too high in the human ear.
The electrical impulses are switched on genetically modified commercial nerve cells, in which ultrasonic waves to film channels.
The subject: the researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers say that the worms of the new show, the genetics, the designated method, in which an ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body by hand.
In La Jolla, California of the Salk Institute scientist Sreekanth Chalasani told the Guardian that the method could one day replace the deep brain stimulation, it's invasive procedure, in which the human brain is electrical impulses to treat Parkinson's disease.
Roundworms do not normally respond to ultrasound Chalasani, but found that, when they are surrounded by liquid, which is microscopically small bubbles, the situation changed.
He found that bubbles confirmed the ultrasonic waves, which then pass the worms inside.
The ultrasonic waves affect the TRP 4 4-ionikanaviin, structures, which exist in some of the worms of the cell membranes.
The sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the adherent cells, as reported in the Nature Communications journal, published the report.
In order to prepare with ultrasound steerable nematodes, Chalasani worms genetically modified, so that the nerve cells in the part of their business is TRP 4 4-ionikanavat.
When I used to edit Chalasani ultrasound worms, micro bubbles confirmed the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms, which they switched on fabricated business nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetiikassa, groundbreaking tools, which will give scientists the opportunity to turn the nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
Chalasani said, however, that there may be some advantages to the use sonogenetiikan optogenetiikkaan compared to.
Unlike light, which must be sent to optical fibre along the desired point within the brain, matalataajuuksiset ultrasonic waves can travel unhindered through the tissue, so it can be sent to the brain from the skull.
"we believe that the gene therapy virus using therapeutic and it may be possible to target human nerve cells to respond to momentary ultrasonic signal in certain neurological treatment in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could be to focus on the target muscle cells and insulin producing cells, he added.

The eight golden rules in a dorm living
It's been 11 years since, unaware I was 19 when I moved into a student dormitory, and then you still believe in berets and moral relativism, but it is only now I remember my annoying people forced smiles - and a large number of complaints from other long.
I was a big part of the learning can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Amendment to the dorm could be anything for the nerves of the fair is scary.
Attractiveness is Babble: tell me where you're from, like the years and where, what do you think of the Corbynista, and why, "Seriously, I don't love or hate Marmite because really it's just the yeast extract hahaha I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And will also help other breath - ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the debate and help you find those people, like, nor those who didn't want to talk about, even if your eyelashes are the fire extinguishers and they share.
Give people space.
People often change room for a cocktail party, movie night the place and yleiksi leisure locations, but they are also places where people dress up and her underwear.
In your subject: don't even think about start university in a relationship
The university is a tough place for an introvert.
Your room should be a place to rest, but to many of the dorm room is made up of another wandering culture, which is a friendly, social causes and lifelong friendship.
It may mean shit to someone who's trying to get some rest.
Nothing in this culture does not give you permission to say, "I like you, and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now, that I can collect back energy which I spent in my conversations with you."
Try to sense when a college guy is tired of socialisation - and perhaps send a text message to knock at the door instead.
Of knocking when I became president: knock on the door.
There was a guy in my college dormitory was of the opinion that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw quite a lot of stuff.
Make friends through the baking.
When do you start university on the baking trend in peak periods, people knock at the door with a plate of chocolate cake and itself the presentation seems somewhat less strange, less "Welcome to the neighborhood, I made something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions from" 50 0-lukulaiselta.
Itsetehtyjen treats the provision is a great way to make friends.
Your partner feel obliged to talk, and it may be that they continue to associate your face to a tasty surprise.
This of course depends on it, you know how to bake.
Badly mixed flour Sugar Fat blobs is likely to make people just pretend to be asleep when you knock on my door.
Stealing food is a common crime in the student dormitory.
Understandably, some chicken stealing is stealing, but what about if you take just a drop of milk in your tea?
Ask and check the milk from the owner.
Is it possible that they are going to give you permission, while boiling inside.
If someone steals all your stuff, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but I try to take that adults like my dorm mates which, when mixed with milk to detergent to punish those who stole it.
He is now in prison.
You should not make noise, so that people do not get to sleep or study.
Not only are you a decent person, but because you're like the proverbial pot calling the kettle black.
A girl in my hall asked his neighbors, they could they play his drum and bass music down, because at the time it was three in the morning and he had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally stopped at 5 in the morning, she kindly gave them sleep for two hours before he put his own music, locked his door and went to kolmetuntiseen exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic, if you happen to change your future spouse in the same dorm with you?
Or conversely, would it not be incredibly embarrassing if like dorm mate as your future spouse, hooking up, divorced, and then to see him every day, and possibly lose all your mutual friend to him.
Of course, The Heart Wants What It Wants, but if the hot dorm partner is definitely not your future spouse, you could at least try and talk some sense into your head.
In that exhilarating moment when you discover that someone has left his keys in his locked room, and the line between keppostelun bullying is thinner than what it seems.
A good trick is nice, but it is reversible in the moment.
You can give the useful and fun teaching safety by hiding something - but don't ever mess up some room in the toothpaste and shampoo.
To lock her door and drop the keys in a glass of water, which was then put in the freezer - but do not put their property on the blue sticker on the ceiling, as no more than twice.

A public university is staying people from 12 different nationalities.
They are already in Finland for a while is underage students and newly arrived asylum seekers.
In all the mess building has been a status.
Part of a student at an elementary school, is part of the vocational studies and part of studying English, "luukkainen tells me.
The status quo is what is known as a permanent residence permit, which can be granted for a term of four years in Finland for quite some time now is a foreigner.
Police are investigating the attack as itä-suomen Damages Act and a breach of the peace.
Luukkaisen according to students on Monday, held a press conference, which was also the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic, no one has wanted to go away.
We have had a dozen years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens, "luukkainen says.
According to luukkaisen mess has been cleaned up from the walls out already.
Perpetrators are suspected to have been at least three men and they had been on the move in the light of personal car.
I think this is a youth week for the rest of the night, the moment when this subject has now been on the surface.
Nothing that serious, "luukkainen says.
Also in the salon is graffiti Hospital, which is planned for the reception center.

State to abolish y-codes karjaalle train passengers annoyed about the weather, "idiotic"
From Helsinki to raseborg karjaalle y-codes passing train stopped running in March.
News of that train to resent the night shift emerging passengers at Helsinki railway station.
Most of the strikes in the Beedle, said the resident Torbjörn bengtström.
Absolutely idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and employed need rapid and smooth link to Helsinki.
This can't be about anything other than on the political will - or lack of it.
Bengtström says in his interview with a hstv:n video came a tractor to the capital city.
In other parts of the Uusimaa changes going on the train.
On the mainline the H and R trains combined to make new R line.
Purolan role in järvenpäässä buds and castle tuusulassa remain out of use.
Transport and communications ministry and the VR announced on Tuesday the information on how to buy a train routes, the ministry of transport in the next contract period.
The period of change at the turn of the year and the abolition of routes is in the whole country.
In the autumn, finish the new four-year agreement later adopted by the Committee on monetary affairs.
Beedle bengtström believes that the state railway Slicer is short-sighted action.
Make the same mistake, what has been done in the past and repeated it in a very systematic way.
Then comes the remorse on.
Y-codes train also use other than raseborg and siuntio, because it is fast and skip several stations.
Espoo Annina pöyryä felt in urban areas away from the fate of train travel.
"it is precisely the hate for those who are planning their trips again," he said their pain to y-codes train.
Little relief is in store for.
The beach to the track is going to be a new rail link, which will replace the y-codes train Helsinki transport (HSL), which leads to the church on the moor.
This will bring more costs for the practice area municipalities to hsl:lle and their taxpayers.
"we are now starting to figure out the various options and their impact on the level of service and the ticket price," said the managing director of the Suvi rihtniemi hsl:n.
The cost is still impossible to assess accurately.
Rihtniemi tells us that the number of passengers on the basis of the HSL has paid the y-codes train at about 1 million a year, the Ministry of course much more than this.
The main track from the R line leaves between two stations.
Instead, the sauna and ainolassa rock train double the number of crossings.
The whole country to stop a total of 28 small station and a number of routes.
The ministry will no longer buy train traffic from Route Joensuu nurmes, Tampere and seinäjoki Haapamäki keuruu Jyväskylä.
Route shortened the route pieksämäki Joensuu pieksämäki theft.
The train shifts reduced on routes Riihimäki Lahti, cattle, the port of Hanko Kouvola Eagle and kajaani Oulu.
In the end turn to do more than half a million trips a year, while the total bought in the Ministry of Transport distances of about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring to the state of the 12 million annual savings.
The value of the contract is approximately 27 million euros a year.
Sixten korkman wrote a chapter in the capital of the topicality of "the worth of Marx"
The global economic crisis has brought to the surface of the Karl Marx (1818 1883) and his 1894 in 1867 published the work of the capital, writes the former chairman of the well-known skp:n geοrge Chevron published today of Marx's Capital topicality.
"they take him seriously now than I have in a long time," Chevron writes in his preface.
Marx's assessment of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and penetrate more widely to all areas of life, the concentration of capital and financial capital and an imaginary capital growing role have proved remarkably far-sighted.
In the clasp of organised capital seminars based on the writer's list is also a university professor, I appreciate the talent of Sixten korkman.
In the book, writes korkman Marx was timely "now and forever."
I don't think the former by Business Research Institute and the business delegation to the managing director, however, is a Marxist?
Oh, no, no, no.
Korkman tells me on the phone that he doesn't like Marx as a timely economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Now social sciences are diversified and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"the common perception is that noble history tells us about the dead men wrong opinions," korkman start.
The truth is that Marx's predictions hard to go wrong.
Even though Marx understood the nature and importance of the Industrial Revolution, he pulled the capitalism of the journey too far to conclusions, whether korkman.
But korkman, however, sees the value in Marx's radical attitude.
"Marx is relevant in that, he asked good questions," he says.
It will be discussed again, Marx interests such as wealth distribution.
"Marx might perhaps give inspiration for anyone who wants to understand the big picture, as a result of technical upheaval in a changing world ', analyse korkman.
But, in what the government ought to decide tomorrow, not of Marx's help.
On his mind capitalism was a hopeless case, that I should just quit.
Still, Marx believes that supports the korkmanin look.
"in the '70s, Marx couldn't read," says korkman.
"the Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hate capitalism, but its even more Other."
Now the debate is more diversified, and also Marx can approach without the years of ideological and political baggage.
"every social scientist should get to know Marx philosophy - as well as other classics," says korkman.

The only emergency vehicles.
The 00531'arçay direction traffic will be cut off from the traffic circle, West Point kaisaniemen direction from mannerheimintieltä since.
Enough with the Helsinki Police Department people, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
For the time being at least, it seems that is enough.
Police work to combat things don't take a position.
In Helsinki is kujalan according to the coming protests, therefore the patrols from the rest of Finland.
The precise amounts of the patrol police didn't tell me.
"some is coming in, but as a general rule, we'll be fine on our own," Kujala said.
The police are advised to avoid private cars on the roads in downtown Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala, estimates that the worst traffic gridlock stretching from 00531'arçay level to the downtown core.
Static traffic is expected on the day in the morning until the evening.
The rest of the demonstrators arrived with Finland in Helsinki on the way is also a lot of charter buses.
They are not allowed access to the railway market.
The buses are in pretty far.
The rest of the way and then have to walk to the rally site, "Kujala tells me.
Protest to stop also the Helsinki public transport.
From the point of view of the police in this is the positive side.
Mass traffic flow issue, which is normally present in this big crowd gatherings, it is now part of himself.

Police are waiting for protests to be going peacefully.
Violence is ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, the Finns are sensible and peaceful people, "Kujala said.
In different parts of Finland will take place on Friday, but also local demonstrations.
Friday's demonstration is in many ways exceptional - remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Trade unions on Friday organized a big demonstration is in many ways an interesting and unusual.
It did not, for example, found in the Finnish political history a very good reference point, says University of Jyväskylä sociology professor emeritus Martin siisiäinen.
As such, it is not surprising that the trade union movement is protesting.
If it doesn't do that, it would increase the government in front of the Hands Up, siisiäinen says.
A very right-wing government has hit the Finnish korporatismin tradition nuclear points - and also the points which have been the Finnish welfare state for the development of important.
The government of the rough to a lack of contract law.
This is a lot of features to the fact that the trade union movement is indeed trying to get on his knees.
At the same time also jåmo move is a place to look in the mirror.
The Mirror is needed, for example, that the move is far from jåmo all employees' support for the Friday demonstrations.
New now is that a rigid division, which makes protest at the time, the forces that want to be involved in the trade union movement in a demonstration.
From across Finland gathered unemployed people demonstrating in the parliamentary House in November 1993.
If the demonstrations Friday looking for a reference point, it could be unemployed in a giant demonstration in 1993, held Thursday, puberty siisiäinen says.
In the midst of a deep depression in the adolescent Thursday collected one of 20 000 unemployed people.
Esko Aho (KESK) Labour government stumbles from one crisis to another.
They said that the Finnish government and the employees' organizations and have never before been as bad as the Aho of the bourgeois government.
Now the government and the trade union movement are perhaps even worse than the puberty Thursday.
Besides the Power is now in the Finnish government, never very porvarinlahti siisiäinen says.
The current governing coalition is still in that way, it's so interesting that a right-wing president in spite of the Finns.
The last time was the old jytkyn certain elements of the Labour movement.
Expected to attend on Friday, several thousand protesters.
To stop the protest and also public transport and shuts down any nurseries and schools.
Although no protest gets the undivided support, it could be the biggest in years.
In Helsinki, has in recent years organised a demonstration of about 300 annually.
It is across the board.
Traditionally in the Finnish trade union movement rallies has been rather quiet - although the policies have, in recent years, tougher.
Traditionally in the Finnish rally to avoid a conflict, we are law-abiding.
The demonstrators seek to avoid property damage or destruction, siisiäinen says.
The end of the 1990s, however, brought a new impetus.
Protest culture changed.
Membership of the EU was nervous farmers threw eggs and the police are prepared to get on his pig shit.
Firefighters strike in 1998 lasted three months.

As firefighters strike for three months in 1998
Firefighters strike was one of the 1990s was one of the longest, if not the longest nationwide strike.
The farmers are opposed to the EU in 1994 and 1999.
The police went into the rain egg farmers protest against the EU in 1994.

Also the EU Helsinki Summit in 1999, got the farmers protest and burn the hay bales in front of the venue of the meeting.

Sometimes the sea is hard, and at 20 metres high waves passengers cry and throw up.
At the destination of human cargo is unloaded in half an hour and the Emir leaves for the return trip.

Smugglers of The King
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
Rich Turks has been called a master of marketing and the Mediterranean, the undisputed king of the illegal invasion, which dominates the sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.

One of the new method is a luxury ship scam: a Turkish port rent yachts would take American or European families for a few nice tourist day cruise.
In reality, the ships loaded onto a crowded Syrians, Kurds, Iraqis and Afghans, who transport 5,000 to 7,000 euro fee first overland from Istanbul to a port and then by sea to Europe.

They are told to hide in vegetation and wait for the signal.

Passengers have to stay all the way below decks out of sight.
The Coast Guard could only observe, how deep in the ship's swimming, because any other signs of human population are not visible from the outside.
Food and drink, but what fewer passengers to defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük gets one of the luxury vessels travel expenses after about 53, 000 euros.
He's not taking care of the practical things themselves but hire captains, recruiters, guards, majoittajat and other small factors do work for themselves.
In the summer period arranging the transport of at least hundreds of Küçük and make millions.
He expected to buy cover through companies, pharmaceutical companies in the country and more than a hundred apartment, which he rents out.

Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to the We Need Diverse communications sipilän channels, and the prime minister's television and radio talk is one channel among others.
Also such direct speaking channel is needed in the future.
This is not going to stay here for the last time, Sipilä said to reporters in the parliament.
Sipilä still did not want to estimate how often repeated to the prime minister's speech on television and radio.
According to sipilän speeches may not always care for the future of the general channels.
If other channels for reporting channels, so we'll see.
Now used this evening this channel, Sipilä said.
According to the Finnish economy sipilän's condition is so serious that it requires television and radio speech to the public.
This set of issues, what we are talking about now, is quite complicated and requires a long argument.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be sent at 21.05: 20 in both TV1 and the Radio Finland.
It can also be considered in the general arena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
Media researcher, hopes that no sipilän television speech tell us about the general government turning inwards.
The aim is to take the public debate to define rights more firmly into their own hands and to say no to a public debate on the difficulties? considering the Stockholm University professor ANU koivunen.
Reminds me of the foreign minister (Timo) Soini's recent comment that he would not comply with the media agenda and not let it define themselves.
In the Democratic debate and the public in the name of hope, that these issues are not related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about the sipilän notification.
It would be strange if the media field does not react.
Political leaders of the communication styles are not reporting things in a democracy.
As the representatives of the media's role is by definition to try not to let the politicians agenda.
Koivusen television speech to sipilälle is a big risk.
In his speech, sipilän should bring to the table something new and special, so that the president set exceptionally high expectations are met.
Today there is more of that, what we have heard already?
Or will he be able to speak in a different tone, a different way or a different said, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if the permit is just more of the same old, you have to wonder why such a grand gesture made on a bed and gave it an exceptional time.
Too general to take this risk, in that sense, even if it is not the specific situation but a routine speech among the others.
There is a danger that the general stigma for a politician or the representative of the government and the media, which is certainly not the general interests or the general line.
The sipilältä Smart Move
In sipilän forthcoming speech, it is also important to what Prime Minister leaves unsaid, media researcher points out.
At night should be considered carefully, what Sipilä is missing and what not, says University of Jyväskylä research coordinator Homer seal.
Harp says TV sipilältä speech is the smart move, because this is how this is going to bring their own vision to the gravel without raised voices.
This is a message to the general public without the journalistic filter, contrary to what the press conference, where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypassing the media and talk directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media interpretation of the speech I do something wrong, because you won't let me submit specific questions.
According to the seal, it is very important how Sipilä appears in TV, dripping sweat, shaking hands.
He compares sipilää to father figure who now tells people what to do.
If he can make his case very Sipilä, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government information about something, because these people, as if talking directly to another person.
This kind of (US President Barack) Obama and co are having on a regular basis.
Truly exceptional
Political scientist erkka rift to the prime minister's speech to the citizens really exceptional.
According to him, that has not happened for decades, and that the prime minister is talking to the people directly.
Exceptional times require exceptional means, says the rift.
The investigator believes that the prime minister wants this to get in front of the Finns to receptive is blackmail.
Employees' organisations organising the Friday demonstrations and strikes against the government's actions.
The left-wing association chairman Paavo Arhinmäki says on Twitter that Sipilä could keep his speech on the state of the Union in the parliament as the prime minister's declaration that the president will also discuss.
The SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (SD) again. To announce a challenge to sipilän dialogue.
Now is not the time for the monologue.
Soon a half years from the election.
Can't hide forever, your writing on Twitter.

You have things pretty badly anyway, and you're going to improve it, not any amirkhani decides.

A psychologist advises: I saw you tell children refugees
Many parents have been forced in recent days to think about how to tell the children to Europe to the situation of the refugees.
Or is it you at all?
It doesn't have to take by force the crisis the SPR, a member of the group, a psychologist Ferdinand garoff advises.
Small children are worth protecting, not, for example, to let them watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they were seeing, and it could stay around to mind and anxious, he says.
If a child has, however, run into a television news images of the refugees or heard about it somewhere else, it would be worth it to mention.
The debate is good to go on the child's starting point and to listen very carefully to what he says.
The child fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily those whose parents think he was afraid.
Children in vain, even if you don't want to scare myself too anxious and scared.
Small children will closely monitor their parents' behaviour.
If the parents themselves to remain calm during the debate, even a child feels safe.
The bigger kids are confronted with a discussion of the refugees are likely to be in school, with friends or on the internet.
Parents is a good thing to take with them to address the matter, where curious kids.
The fact is that not all people in the world are things very well.
Parents might consider how, together with the kids in our family to this approach.
The world is our view, however, at the end of the safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also be a different parenting perspective - some may want to protect their children, as far as possible from the anxiety.
On the other hand, if the family should also talk about difficult issues, the child may be the model for how to deal with difficulties in life in front of the future.
This can be of benefit to him in the future.

The disease was not the mild end of the fight, but it took two of the Curia.
Because Clover ball lightning was with light exercise, Pohjola says he was pleasantly surprised the horse of the last race.
It was in Turku in record time a second wind after the legendary mare.
Clover ball lightning was from the break in his very pressure when it was possible to drive normally just a few weeks.
Those things considered a small deflection at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach expects that fitness competition did to the ORI.
The horse went about it definitely breeze ahead, and I hope it would also be settled.

This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programmes
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least part of the Apple iPhone phones with future programmes might be removed at some point in the future - but not quite all.
Apple intends to in the future, possibly to remove some of its own programme of iPhone phones, says company CEO Tim Cook at Buzzfeed magazine interview.
Of the Apple iPhone in a series of programmes which are relatively few use: for example, the FaceTime calls, newsstand, health, stock exchange, podcasts and tips come to mind.
This programme is the latest addition to the Apple Watch, which came by way of update on the iPhone phones, even though it is necessary only for Apple Smart Watch owners.
Cook says Apple's removal of the programmes is a more complex issue than meets the eye.
Some applications are linked to one another in iPhonessa.
If they are removed, it may cause problems in somewhere else on the phone, Cook notes to buzzfeedille.
Cook did not mention which of the Apple iPhone applications working closely together with other programmes.
There are other programs that do not work this way.
So with time, I think that we will be able to develop a way to give the user to remove them, Cook added.
Cook said Apple is looking into this, as the company does not want to waste memory space for iPhone users phones.
In the Euro area inflation faded to 0.1% in August
In the euro area in August, consumer prices rose only marginally by 0.1% a year ago, the EU statistics authority Eurostat said today.
Rising prices pulled down energy cheaper.
Eurostat revised this a couple of weeks ago, 0, 2 per cent of its estimates slightly downwards.
In July, inflation was at 0.2%.
It said underlying inflation fell in August to 0.9% from July 1, 0%.
Eurostat 's preliminary estimate of underlying inflation was 1.0%.
The energy was in the euro zone last month, 2 per cent cheaper than a year ago.
In all 28 countries in the EU area, the average inflation rate at zero in August.
In July, the increase came to 0.1 percent.
Most of the euro countries, i.e. 1%, consumer prices rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, the inflation rate was the lowest prices fall 1.9 per cent.
In Finland inflation was 0.2% negative EU harmonised price index.
Euro area inflation remains stubbornly far from the European Central Bank (ECB), which is the target of 2% price increase in the medium term.
The ECB predicts the euro area for this year, an average of 1 per cent inflation.
Next year the increase up to 1.1%, the central bank predicted in early September to announce a new inflation forecasts.
The United States is trying to tighten monetary policy following the Fed
The United States following the recession begins to peak in less than a year, but the more likely within three years, after the country's central bank fed again will take a long time to raise their interest rates.
And in the financial markets it's all downhill from here for themselves before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that interest rates may start as early as this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
So the next recession could push her on to the next by the autumn and rattling financial markets and the exchange rate before then.
Or at least that is what will happen if the world's biggest economy and the financial markets operate on it as they have been in the habit of - and if they don't respond to blackmail the Fed monetary taps as we have done before.
Such conclusions have ended up German banks, Deutsche Bank London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in a comprehensive long-term market and Economic Cycle Research.
The bank distribute more than 60 pages long term asset return study research report to its major international customers last week.
Studies and reports by strategists do not pretend to know exactly when the Fed will raise its interest rates in the market or the economy, and what happens after that.
Instead, they present the facts and statistics to cool its calculations of how the economy and the market are already acting to Fed interest rates during and after.
In addition to the historical data, they look at what the economy and financial markets are now key variables in the same or another model than previous interest rates - and what the possible consequences.
It is clear that the economy and financial markets are now in shaky shape to withstand higher interest rates than at any time in the past since the 1950s.
At the beginning of the recession, maybe not years
The Fed 's monetary policy and its stance of the relevant leaders have decided over the last summer and early autumn, implied that the time is getting ripe for the increase in interest rates.
The first rate increase in more than nine years may come as early as this week.
Will be decided over the course of Wednesday and Thursday, when the Fed board known as the FOMC meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised the so-called Fed funds rate in June of 2006.
Then ended exactly two years of relatively small but regular at a time by 0.25 percentage points to a series of interest rates, which the Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25% to 25%.
The financial symptoms began in 2007 with the United States risky mortgage financing difficulties, and years later the financial crisis ripped open a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
The last time the financial markets and the real economy serious setbacks began at a slower pace than previous interest rates after the Fed has typically been the case.
Similarly, trials were then hard and harsh than at any time since the 1930s depression.
Deutschen strategists are sifting through some of the world's largest economies takeoffs and landings as well as financial market developments from 1950 onwards and always places since the beginning of the 19th century.
The Fed interest rate increases and the economic and fiscal impact they make sense from the 1950s onwards.
The onset of the recession is the first time since interest rates peaked at less than a year, usually for less than three years and an average of less than three and a half years.
Financial markets rate increase is closed within one to two years from the start of the Federal Reserve interest rates.
The Fed has alternately raised and lowered its key interest rate in the early 1950s after a dozen different cycles.
Each time is different in some respects from the other, and the Times is in the review, the relatively limited, so on that basis I don't think you can conclude anything definite about the impact of the interest rates.
Even strategists remind that this time, things have changed.
Not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
Determining the causes of the financial crisis alone does not necessarily get found guilty beyond doubt even in the decades of research work.
But the three points that led to the crisis and its destructive power is quite aware of the reasons raised:
1) The Fed, the euro area, the ECB and other major central banks in the world in the 21st century, held its key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the tech bubble, and raised at the same time, the following.
2) the financial and real economy in various parts of the developed over the decades, and already too large amount of debt increased from central banks, loose monetary policy in order to effect an even bigger.
Born of economic history, the biggest debt bubble.
3), especially in the financial economy substantially without disincentives builder crazy cheap debt financing expanded to most areas of the financial markets to economic history of the largest rate of bubbles in real estate, shares, bonds and commodities.
I don't think that either a very strong argument that, in the increasingly complicated debt lever on the soaring financial markets were exceptionally dangerous and unstable situation, when the Fed and other central banks the last time you drove up interest rates.
The debt on the building, let alone the financial levers pulse-excited valuation bubbles could not bear as his time after that, when interest rates had begun and debt financing costs were turned for takeoff.
The risk materialises during the financial crisis, and that was followed by the Great Recession.
The higher the bubble and more debt
Deutschen strategists not to speculate about what happens next, but give tuumailun subject mentioning, for example, the following points:
1) The Fed and other major central banks are now kept its monetary policy stance still light on even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they are now even longer still lower.
2) the debt is not for a long time been a crazy cheap, like 10 years ago, but now its cheap money as debt is literally cheaper than free.
So the financial and real economy debt load is not less, but in different parts of the economy now churning a lot heavier debt load than before the financial crisis, or for that matter at any time in the past.
3) The more torrential and cheap central bank liquidity left in circulation is largely left to the financial markets and get the main securities and asset classes to their most expensive since before the peak of the financial crisis, or ever.
Not the only downer strategists the mood of financial markets and the warning signs, but they also point out that even the United States economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and recession in decades on the pregnant model as it has happened in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak but equally financial market pressures and risks are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed will begin to tighten its monetary taps tight.
Maybe the French bank Societe generalen strategist Albert Edwards the future picture is not as weird as I may seem offhand.
He is already a good time coaching international investors bank customers to the Fed next U-turn:
First, the Fed raising interest rates, then the fiscal bubble burst - and soon the Fed is pretty run to put out the financial fires with an even higher QE raharuiskuilla.

The Ahtisaari in The Guardian: Western countries rejected the Russian proposal from overthrowing al Assad
Western countries fight over three years ago the Russian offer to Syrian President Bashar al Assad should be made to relinquish power, says the president, Martti Ahtisaari, to the Guardian.
Ahtisaari, according to the Russian ambassador to the United Nations proposed the plan to Al Assad have receded after some time, the power of style.
Western countries, however, not taken up in the proposal because they believed Al Assad fall anyway in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012, as the UN Security Council's five permanent members with the country.
Ahtisaari, according to Russian Ambassador Vitaly tshurkin listed for him in a private conversation three point plan: opposition was not armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to immediately get the connection between the president and the renunciation of al-Assad had carried out discreetly.
I know tshurkinin.
We don't necessarily have to agree on all the issues, but we will be able to discuss openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said he would sit down, Martin, and I'll tell you what we need to do, Ahtisaari recalls in the Guardian interview.
The diplomats did not comment
Ahtisaari says his care tshurkinin message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin not confirmed to The Journal the substance of the debate, but Ahtisaari says it is not two words.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on the allegations, but Ahtisaari said that al-Assad's forces were already at that time made a number of massacres and the main opposition groups refused to of all contracts, which he would have remained in power.
British Foreign Office Middle East Division and former director of Sir John Jenkins, the president of the Ahtisaari hesitation, because of his experience in Russia has not at any point ready to discuss Assad's fate.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the duration of the war.
The weakest point in the argument is that Ahtisaari tshurkin spoke in Moscow mandate.
If he had told me about tshurkinin speeches, I would have answered that I want to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin, so I can take it seriously.
Jenkins said that he was even in that case the suspects, that it would have been Putin's trick to keep the Power on some Assad supporters.
The flow of refugees of our own doing

We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own doing.
I don't see any other option than to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill, whose self-inflicted, Ahtisaari said to the paper.

The US central bank policy makers sitting on two days this week in a huge mahogany table around the long-awaited meeting deciding the time has come to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
On the other end of the central bank, a two-story meeting room is a decorative wall painting in the United States.
The map is a reminder that the central bank president Janet L. yellenin and his colleagues will set the nation's economic interests above all else.
Congress has been calculated by the central bank to shoulder the dual responsibility: they enter the United States to maximize employment and keep prices stable.
The Great Depression after central bank leaders have agreed, however, that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is this third requirement can be a key factor in the decision published on Thursday, which is so tight that it cannot even be predicted. Decision on whether it is the U.S. economy ready to weaned on record, which at the end of the year incentives until 2008 to almost nil in short-term interest rates has brought.
Even though most of the data shows the economy growing strongly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have already done in advance, is wary of the central bank officials more jumpy when it comes to increasing volatility. Fear of how the impact if the federal funds rate to the reference value even lift a quarter percentage point.
"understandably, the labour market and inflation is the first and most important aspects which are monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, a brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co, the main economic expert.
"I do believe, however, that if they were looking for a justification to leave interest rates unchanged, the increased uncertainty in the global market has enough valid grounds still waiting," he says.
The central bank decision has not reached an agreement, which it also creates nervousness in the economy.
Bloomberg recent survey, about half of the economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets now expect the central bank to delay the drawdown as key indicators of the opportunity for growth is only around 30%.
This points to a stock market decline, if the central bank raises the level, if not policy makers, then work to soften the blow by promising that the next increase will not happen in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index rose 228, 89 points, or 1.4 per cent, the new chapter is 16 599, 85.
The recovery brought with them the expectation that the central bank keeps rate unchanged this week, says John Lonski, Moody's capital markets research group -rymän main economic expert.
"it is surprising, if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, "they have to see a lot of trouble in its guidelines to support the financial markets so that they do not to panic."
Some experts argue that the increased level of reassuring the financial markets, because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the central bank should be in this month to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, taking the first small step toward monetary tightening, which certifies the slow recovery, the stability of the United States.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer, that he expected the level to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals in their appeal more economic development.
Even though the new job creation slowed in August, job growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1%, which is the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level the central bank considers the full limit.
Wage growth has shown signs of cheer.
Even though inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, the central bank policy makers, the main reason for this is significantly deepening the impact of oil prices temporary.
"the economy can handle larger than the interest rate level and also needs them, taking into account the tough situation of the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics in a company's financial expert.
Financial markets around the world, however, upset last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index fell by up to 16 per cent from its May record, as investors feared the slowdown of the Chinese economy, but also to slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the peak in May.
Central bank policy makers to market turmoil is an additional element in the complex equation that tells when interest rates should be increased.
"without these financial market events of recent weeks and the news on China's economic weakness, policy makers tighten the level at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Zima UCLA Center for Real Estate Agency special investigator and former central bank officials.
Now he predicts that policymakers are waiting for at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
"the possible consequences for the US economy are still very unclear, and they don't have too much information at their disposal when it comes to China, the consequences of the events," Oliner said.
International economic welfare is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making process.
In the practice of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank has come, however, the world monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence is enormous.
In 2013, the then chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, the implication that the central bank may "narrow" the increase in the number of money, that caused the upheaval in markets around the world.
In a world in which the markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected to not only following developments elsewhere, also consult other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabell, Envestnet asset management company inc:in global strategy chief.
Located in the state of Virginia, Richmond Federal Reserve databank (Federal Reserve bank president Jeffrey Lacker pointed out this month that "the central bank has previously been overreacting to financial market movements that seem to be separated from economic fundamentals."
Decisions by the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee has called for the interest rate increase, and Lacker, committee members entitled to vote, invoking the example of the year 1998 / 99 decisions.
The Asian financial crisis caused it, that the central bank cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points in the three meetings to get to and from, "despite its limited aid, identifiable by the impact of the US economic growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank lifted these cuts.
The central bank should put economic stability at the forefront as the only big during the crisis, such as when the market crashed in 2008, "said Adam S. Posen, the Bank of England (Bank of England interest rate determining committee former member.
The latest turmoil does not come anywhere near that level, Posen says.
"nobody wants a situation in which the interest rate increase is a fear, therefore, that upset the market," Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute chairman Posen says.
Federal law on the central bank (the Federal Reserve Act is still inside her double standards, not to mention the economic stability, and as long as this is the case, I do not think they should see it coming.

Weight-loss surgery may help obese diabetics with moderate
New research shows moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes benefits of weight-loss surgery can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether live this mildly obese diabetic diet after surgery for a longer time than those who are treated in other ways, like surgery.
"the mortality data takes a long time," Dr. Robin Blackstone, notes, he is an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery periodicals.
Weight reduction, i.e. bariatrisissa in surgery, the use of different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the sense of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatriset cuts has been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the vast majority of the persons involved in the investigation has been morbidly obese, and their body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
BMI, a ratio of weight to height is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24, 9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person's BMI is over 30, he is considered to be obese.
You can calculate your own bmi:si here: 1.usa nhsda.htm 1D0ZqDv. /
This new research, scientists at taiwanilaisessa Min Sheng General Hospital hospital used data collected from 2007 onwards to compare two types of surgery bariatrista, gastric bypass surgery and gastric reduction, type 2 diabetes, medicinal treatment for people who were moderately obese.
The investigation showed that staff cuts, the average BMI fell to 31 24,56 5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, those who were treated by means other than surgery, BMI remained broadly the same at 29.
The street person completely cured of diabetes by 36% and 28% in part.
For comparison, diabetes medicines in the treated group recovered completely by just 1% and partly about 2%.

The researchers also followed a patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c value should remain in less than 7%, the researchers write.
Post-operative hemoglobin A1c levels fell from about 9% to around 6%.
In the medicinal treatment groups, however, it remained stable at around 8%.
This better "glykeeminen 'control, which improved hemoglobin A1c levels represent, does not reduce mortality over a period of five years, says lead researcher Dr. Chih Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two different type of intersection between.
In the fifth year, when compared to the stomach reduction surgery group, fermented in the gastric bypass group had been lost more weight (18, 7 and 14, 2 kg), the more their Body Mass Index (7, 4, and 5, 1), decreased their hemoglobin A1c levels (more than 3%, and 2%), and was more likely to achieve a complete remission from diabetes (46, 9% and 16%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix Blackstone, says that, although the research does not show survival or surgery, after five years, there is a research results from Sweden, where the surgery led to longer life in heavier people.
In the Swedish study, it was found that weight-loss surgery go excess fat was 29 per cent less likely to die in a 15 year period, compared to a group that had tried traditional methods of treatment.
Although the new study does not show improvement in the survival of patients undergoing surgery, Blackstone says, however, that the results are encouraging for people with a BMI of less than 35 and who are interested in the surgery.
"the results of the research are crucial right there, that they show that the surgery is safe for the lower body mass index" group, and is not linked to a rise in the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should be the weight to be taken very seriously at that stage, when the patient is a BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long before taking this seriously," he says.
I believe that when a person is collecting these genetic changes, which permanently prepared his body to obesity and diabetes, the situation is very difficult.

The Dalai Lama claimed that, in the current situation, the entire human race should put the needs of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that, while the countries of western Europe's response to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"not everybody can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria what to do in a crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
"it's great to take care of the many thousands of refugees, but in the meantime, I have to think about long-term solutions to this: how Muslim countries can bring true peace and real development, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the killing in his country.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved this problem, "he added.

In the last four years the children hand disinfectant ingestion has increased four-fold
Poison control centers across the United States have reported nearly 400% increase in the strongly alcoholic hand disinfectant swallow below the age of 12 children in the years after 2010, says the Georgia Poison Center.

"the children were interested in these products more frequently, and unfortunately, a certain percentage of them have to the ER," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some of the kids drink disinfectant on purpose, while some want to impress his friends or to respond to the challenge of social media.
There's a YouTube video, in which teenagers drink alcohol to get a cheap high hops.
According to reports, teenagers are mixed in alcoholic disinfectant mouthwash to get strong drink.
Pleasing disinfectant smell may attract young children.
"a child does not think that this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the interesting (hand sanitizer) are like that, with added fragrance.
There are strawberries, grapes and orange smell disinfectants, which are very attractive to children.
Hand sanitizer may contain alcohol anything between 45 and 95 per cent.
Particularly in young children to alcohol poisoning, it only takes a few squirt.
"it's a very concentrated alcohol," the University of Kansas Hospital poisoning Information Centre Medical Director Mr Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So don't leave shots of lying around on the table, but the hand sanitizer out of the left, and if the kids interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.

Your doctor will monitor him overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of possible brain injury, and as alcohol got the girl fell and hit his head, Ritchey said.
"it was really scary," said Scott ortoria nhaijahin mom to CNN.
The situation could have been lethal to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and disinfectant would pass out of the reach of children.
Alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to the deaths.
In 2013 two ontariolaista woman died after swallowing hand sanitizer, which contained the toxic, unreported ingredients.
Health authorities expect that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as the active ingredient.
In its January in upstate New York three fourth graders planned to poison a cruel teacher "by spreading the bacterial poison into the classroom, said the police report.
The teacher is extremely allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from his class.
Police have prevented the plan as "frivolous nonsense" and leave the disciplinary action to the school district.

Why would prove an execution in Oklahoma
If any legal action does not happen later today, when he will be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, sitting in the gallery of spectators at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison visit, when Richard Glossip will be executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the death of the four official witnesses.
I received a request in January by his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I said yes.
I'm starting to dread this day approaches.
So why did I agree?
I said yes, because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Journalists of course have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and, as the applications are often more than seats available, the participants are selected through a horrible draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of reserved seats for the media in the twelve five.
Whoever you choose, considers the event as a cool, cool.
I can't do it.
I'll sit next to Richard glossipin closest friends, and I have created for him in my own contacts made during the months of telephone calls, as well as one of the two and a half hour visit.
I like a man.
We talk and laugh often.
Prison authorities say that they cannot be both witness and reporter, so I can't be with my notebook and pen, I save what I saw.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One of the Oklahoma reporter blamed on Twitter, that I've compromised on my impartiality.
There's a lesson here.
Tell me the story of a prisoner on his way, then you can participate.
I complained to a reporter.
Wedding admitted that "could have put his words better ', but there is still, I think that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has been disagree with something I said and I write things with.
He didn't tell me what I should write, don't do so even if he says.
I have said to him that he may at any time remove me from their witness list.
But he wants to, that there is an international journalist who writes on the issue.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the publicity will help the Death Penalty trend.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware Is By My Side.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to my podcast series.
I don't go in it again through all of the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van treesen would make him in any case guilty of accessory.
But I believe that there is a very strong possibility that he is not guilty of murder.
Sure, I believe that the death penalty is not an evidence was enough.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And so this is the perspective from which to watch him die.
I can't say I'm completely impartial.
There will be other suppliers, which will take care of it.
I give you a description of how it feels to watch, when the man, which I like, die unnecessarily.

Peter Moody says trustee trying to spy on her and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has argued that Racing Victoria stewards try to infiltrate his crack in his garage last year and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He blames the stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity department, claiming that they have a personal campaign in progress against him. On Wednesday, Lady tatain late on race day on the rejection of the measure because it was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his aim has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he is in a very difficult situation lidarin unexplained positive cobalt samples.
He should have his tongue in check spy thesis about a year and a half, I don't want that, "it looks like jealousy."
"I'm not going to say anything about this, and have long been quiet on the matter, but sometimes the frustration so much, that all comes at a time," Moody said.
They knew that the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home tonight and I sleep well.
I want to walk with your head held high and I would like to think that their owners, I do my best for them.
When they start to think differently, then I should no longer continue as a coach.
Then I have to consider what to do with my license.
Earlier Moody drop a bomb in the racing.com website interview, where he told me that the integrity department had tried to spy on his garage.
"a year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man's name when asked about him and offered him a job in my garage, if he cares about it, what do I do when I get there.
They obviously see me as a fraud.
If that is the case, surely they should fire his lawyer, because they have failed in my catch.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, Racing Victoria's current chairman, and Bernard Saundry, Racing Victoria, the current managing director, were all aware of the issue at that time, and we are aware of it today.
Should I start to think that this is going to be personal?
Racing Victoria has finally decided to man-up and perhaps shift the blame to other than the coach about what is happening in the sector?
Am I a harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Perhaps people think so.
Maybe they need to get my license and push me aside, I don't have any doubt that I now say things possibly get them thinking about just that.
But I am now at that point, I don't care anymore, and it suretaa me.
It really makes me sad.
Pressuring them to take a decision, which is their responsibility.
I have my family to support and I can turn my back on this.
The coach has grown frustrated long-term lidarin cobaltous research, and late rejection led him to conclude that "could throw its licensing across the table."
Moody, who is best known for the undefeated champion Black caviarin coaching, has called on race day treatment measures for "naurettavaksi "after that, when the mud or clay Bath was put in the horse's feet, which is against the rules.
"it is against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put in the mud in its leg.
It could have been a Bath last night.
It could have had it last night, too, as it was.
It had in it on race day.
The moodylla may be facing a three-month competition ban race day bath treatment for which the officials began an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who drew up these rules, I don't know anything about the horse.
"we all understand that the rules are necessary, but this has gone too far," Moody said.

The Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy to attack competitors against texas-rules assertions
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised two NRL rugbyliigan champion favorite claims that his team tackles were part of "The Line."
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referee allowed storm "wrestling" with his own side, when it unexpectedly won the final screening in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could barely conceal his reference to stormiin after it won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night at the final screening of Bennett called the game of rugby league "näyteikkunaksi "and said that two of the Queensland team is" very enthusiastic "about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team tackles and said that they only focus on the "Contact" tackle.
Bellamy added that his trust in the two leading coach of the storm of criticism, because it means that they are afraid of losing to the team.
"this will always be heard - not to mention Trent Robinson talking about wrestling, when we lost to them 24 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defense system and our technology all year in the last six weeks have only highlighted the contact in the tackle, and it has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he is obviously a great team to coach, so he is probably not used to losing, and so this was a shock to him.
It's funny how it always comes up this time of year.
Bellamy and Bennett challenged the idea of "exciting" rugby by reminding his mentor that Bennett was coaching the St George Illawarra Dragons won the title in 2010, playing "boring."
Wayne talks about the exciting rugby.
He regarded as important to compare its Saturday night game to our game on Friday night and tell you how exciting their game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember how the 2010 St George was criticized often, it is that it is a boring team, and Wayne said that he could not care less.
But now he has a team who can play that kind of rugby, which we think is exciting, especially when he has a fast young guys.
I like that you want to play, when you have that type of players.
He brought it out of the 2010, but now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not in every team has guys like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, in order to play that way.
I'm going to be confident, when they say things like this, because they are a little bit worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably don't think of me as a resistor in important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the storm and the game was between roostersien in richer than the Broncos and Cowboys between played.
Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 12? 16
Our game was 20 to 18, so we had two goals, but is it more exciting rugby?
Or make it more exciting line of defence the infringement and the goal not to do?
To me this is a matter of policy.
If they mentioned me, it means that at some point we can play against them.
The stormilla has this weekend off, because they have already won the right to a home game either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla sharkseja against next Saturday night in the preliminary finals in dinfast Park. Tickets go on sale next Tuesday morning.

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that the team mates need to support injured Jack wilsherea Dinamo Zagreb before the game
Wenger has also stressed to wilshirelle, that it is only just September, and assuming that his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he wouldn't be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case for wilshireltä missed at least four of the England game, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he is involved in next summer's European Championship.
The biggest shame in this final problem is that wilsheren last season was a strong individual after the ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the start of the season.
"this kind of injury is not career threatening," Wenger said.
It's a bone, which never healed properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his previous ankle injuries, or what he has been.
That may be true from a medical point of view, but also, as Wenger admitted, the player trying to get back in the middle of the season there is always the risk of further injury.
The body is also a nice model.
Premier Injuries Ltd company studies show that wilsherellä has been 23 different injury, since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, he has in the last five months of 157 league games Arsenal played in only 65 games.

Wenger may also put Kieran Gibbs and Nacho Monrealin giroudin Olivier and Theo Walcott instead.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and provide a respite for that miss players," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite, further f-67070 centrilobular maksimirin stadium in Zagreb is scary.
Dinamo is also not lost on 41 of the game after that, when they produce their own "Invincible" campaign last season.

The FriendsFest: comedy series, which taught us there are serious issues between men friendship
It is striking how similar the descriptions is not in the series, especially when you take into account the fact that men need to open up is more desperate than ever, and young men's suicide rates higher than 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in 20 45 5-vuotiaissa man in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In the attempt to address the problem of the Campaign Against Living Miserably (Calm) announced the 2015 men for a year. The aim was to challenge the culture that prevents men from applying for help when it is needed.
Friendship is at the heart of these challenges.
In a recent study was accompanied by more than 2,000 middle school and high school aged students who showed symptoms of depression, according to a study of the person the chance to recover doubled, if high enough percentage of his friend was a "sound mind."
The same with those who were not depressed, the appearance of possible mental health problems likely halved, if they had a mentally healthy friends.
But if the friendship could work, it needs to be available first.
This social media via the communication style goes over and the contents of the time the answer is imminent is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital life, we have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, although in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success are dominated by values, which psychologists call ecais: money, social status, image, and all this is done in the internal values - the desire for personal growth and friendship - at the expense of the deep impact on our mental health.
As the video game developer and billionaire explained recently, the money certainly does not receive greater happiness.
The beauty of the friends was just that, that the focus turned this on its head.
One character is not defined in their work, but even more of their personalities, which stood out clearly to interact as a friend.
Joey and Chandler many hugs, moments in a comfortable chair watching football, Ross, Miss Rachel - this humor came from the knowledge that, yes, men can relate to all of this, even though they often are reluctant to explore his feelings completely.
As Samaritans xaki' volunteer ...kuunnellessani explained to me: "people who are depressed and suicidal, I'm so understand how the slightest interaction with a friend may improve the conditions."
Often contact us take men feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old adage about getting "than" is a strong, as well as the feeling that if it is open about the problems, I'll see you as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer long-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the friendship between men of small moments.
Even if an impartial, outside the station on the other end of the phone to help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from close, personal family and network of friends.
And so if you attend Comedy Central friendsfestiin this weekend, and all the seats are designed to celebrate again, why don't you take your friends for coffee central perkiin.
Or better still, if you see someone at Starbucks alone, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship may mean.
The friends are sent by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 episodes, part #FriendsFest'iin

After that, we've played only in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Qualifying games is not enough.
