Teacher admits shooting his girlfriend during an emergency call
Audio only slightly colored university teacher Shannon Lamb says during an emergency call to the police that he shot his girlfriend and that police officers have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said that the dead woman's close family contact information can be found on this phone.
From inside the house police found the body of Amy Prentiss and notebook page hand-written message: "I am so very sorry I wish I could undo this I loved Amy and she is the only woman who has ever loved me," said the letter, which according to experts is the Lambin signed.
There is nothing to suggest that Lamb, who was teaching two online courses in Minnesota Cleveland Delta State University, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers of the school's campus, where the police believe him to have shot and killed on the history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, the workroom door.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford told university officials had heard shooting at 10.18.
He said Lamb played the fatal emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day the number of deaths rose by a further one: Lamb committed suicide by police besiege votes.

A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lambia, but said that he was also affected by nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong."
Another student Mikel Sykes said Lamb told that he had a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave Delta State University, saying that he was some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the university salary principles meant that, although the Lamb had worked hard in front of a doctoral value, it is not at all guaranteed him an automatic career development and assistant professor posts.
University president William LaForge said that between Lambi and Schmidt, to his knowledge been any conflict, but that "clearly Lambi in mind was something".
Lamb these questions is no longer able to respond.
Then, when the Lamb had fled the campus, the police reached his jäljilleen, when he moved back to Mississippi State of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself .38-caliber pistol in the back yard of a house about one and a half kilometers south of their parents' house in Mississippi Greenville suburb, told the Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.

Carla Hairston told me she was a 15-year-old and 20-year-old Lamb, when they met through common friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was fun, the older guy who tried for many years to teach Hairstonia to play the guitar.
He was quite a charmer in those days.
All the girls were to melt the wax, when he was there, told the now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in a suburb of Jackson, Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were apparently dating for some time.
Emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but their marriage is not a shred of evidence.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the river beach brick house Gautier.
Police told the dog to be in order.

"He is really upset," O'Steen described her daughter.
He was the best friend of her mother.
O'Steen told that it was not met Lambia, but had heard from his daughter Abigail, that the Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss, when the Lamb and Abigail were both performing at the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together with some public concerts.

So they were both quite clever.

Teaching continues on Wednesday.

8 support survey results that show that Donald Trump is seriously
Some have tried to label him pinwheels.
Others see him as just a joke.
Some of waiting for the collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to heave Donald Trumpia out surveys support the top spot, it is not (yet) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national poll in ten Donald Trump has been headed by a two-digit century, and some have begun to seriously think about what this means as far as possible the name of the property of the king.
Term is certainly at an early stage.
These results do not mean that kind of trump is likely to be the Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this stage in 2011 Rick Perry was losing its leading position in the rising Herman Cainille, neither of which received any order states nomination process.
There are also many reasons why it would be a problem for him in the general election.
However, outside groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and conservative economic organization Club for Growth, have taken note of Trump perseverance and begun to use their funds for his kaatamisekseen.
The following recent support survey results suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump suosittuusluvut have made a U-turn.
Just before when Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's support inquiries showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed kiinteistökuninkaaseen.
By mid-July the figure was 40 per cent.
In early August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Currently, six out of ten Republican Donald takes Trumpiin positive.
About three out of ten say that they are negative.
These figures are also valid for the first esivaaliosavaltioissa.
doing Quinnipiac University poll support in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said that they welcomed the Trumpiin.
Two-thirds of republikaaniäänestäjistä would be satisfied if Trump would become a candidate.
CNN / ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump would be a candidate.
Only two out of ten said that they would be "shocked" if he might be a candidate.
Only Ben Carson causes roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent "enthusiastic" Trump vs. 40 percent).
The next highest cause of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21 per cent.
On the other hand 47 percent of republikaaniäänestäjistä would be "dissatisfied" or "shocked" if the regime's favorite Jeb Bush would become a candidate.
Trump spicy character is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpia has been widely criticized for his high-sounding speeches and insults, Monday's ABC News / Washington Post survey found that 52 percent of Republican voters gravitate to the side at the national level consider that kiinteistökuninkaalla is the President of the appropriate disposition.
Quinnipiac last week's survey, the first meeting of the organizing party in the state of Iowa, the figure is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think that Trump has a Director of the appropriate disposition.
However, the ABC / Post poll, 44 percent thinks that his character suitable to act as president, and nearly six in ten are of the opinion that part of his character to the White House.
Republican Voters totuttelevat idea.
When Republican voters think as commentators, they are of the opinion that Trump is a real option.
CNN / ORC survey, four out of ten had to Trumpia the most likely option when asked who is most likely referred to as the Republican candidate.
Yet at the end of July, four out of ten in favor of Jeb Bush.
Data release: Republican Party voters has not always been possible to have the brightest crystal ball.
The last legislature at this time four out of ten Republican was of the opinion that Rick Perry is appointed as a candidate, and only 28 percent in favor of the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of the Republican Party voters to keep Trump as a credible campaign.
Although the Republicans settle in favor of another candidate, Trump still win almost every.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field are likely to have contributed to the Trump cord as support for anti-Trump is divided among a number of other candidates.
However, conducted by Monmouth University at the beginning of September, the poll showed that a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all the other Republican candidates, Trump has the support of the majority in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorini 13 points, Marco Rubiota with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Chris path for every 33 points.
He is tied on points with Ted Cruz.
The only Trump winning candidate?
Should they be set against each other, Ben Carson win businessman Trump large 18 point margin.
Barely a majority Donald Trump has told supporters had made the decision.
New CBS / NYT's survey from Tuesday shows that just over half of Trumpia profitable voters have decided, anybody their voice goes.
The situation may change, of course, no one can be fully confident to say that it would never change his mind.
46 percent reported that they can possibly exchange candidates.
In any case, Trump biggest rival at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said that they had made a decision, are twice as likely to Trump side.
Six out of ten Republican, says that with the Trump agree on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "rapist" campaign, starting his speech, immigration has been a focus of the 2016 debate.
Some are worried that the Trump heroics latinoäänestäjiä to run away from the Republican Party and cause damage to uudelleenbrändäysyrityksiä.
published on Monday, a new ABC / Post-survey, six out of ten Republican Trump says he agrees with immigration issues.
So, it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so too is Donald Trump.
Frustration Board of Directors has risen reached a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of republikaaniäänestäjistä, in large part due to their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republican said Monday's ABC / Post poll that they prefer policies as a person outside of that has government experience.
They are also angry at the federal government.
A two-week trip to Des Moines Register / Bloomberg survey of Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republican is frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "very angry".

Metcash IGA trying to protect their shops Aldin attack in southern and western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the IGA retailers' market share in South and Western Australia before Aldin $ 700 million in the attack.
Aldi is preparing two distribution center, as well as the first trade opening early next year in South and Western Australia, which is coming up to 120 stores. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen its relations with local food brokers and build the IGA brand awareness through mainstream and social media marketing and events, such as the Adelaide show exhibition through.
IGA's retailers and suppliers have jumped by, and brands such as the future Dunsborough ice cream manufacturer Simmo's offer tastings IGA's in stores, and shop owners are selling discounted tickets to the Australian football matches loyal customers.
Metcashin is expected to reveal more details of the defense strategy on 29 September, when this food, alcohol and general hardware wholesaler is holding its annual investor day strategy.
The game has a lot of, as the southern and western Australia constitute nearly 30 per cent of Metcashin IGA stores Area, and in the profit margins are higher than Metcashin eastern Länder in the IGA network.
Southern and Western Australian shoppers are notoriously parochial and IGA's dealers have in them a much larger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 per cent in the south and west by 24 per cent compared with 14 per cent of the eastern states.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi grab some 5 per cent of the two state of the food market within 12 months of the opening of the first movement. Net sales were obtained from all actors, but mainly from independent retailers.
In this week's report, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA's retailers may lose an annual $ 360 million in sales and Metcash could lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year in the south and the west 25 to 30 stores, resulting in a USD 500 and 600 million turnovers in those areas.
Food and food sales volumes and a loss Metcashin at the base of the high fixed costs Metcashille can cost about $ 13 million operating profit loss before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time Metcash to lose market share in the Eastern Länder, mainly Aldille and Cole It, although a recent Roy Morgan survey found that IGA's customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashin food and food sales will decline by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, a leading investment fund manager and the Magellan Financial Group founder Hamish Douglass said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash can be "quite possibly be lost decade".
Metcash has refused to respond to the public comments Douglass.
However, it is understood that the Metcashin a member of the Board of Directors would be taken by last week Contact Douglas SEPARATE.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent since 2010 to 14 per cent, and income Metcashin food and the food business, which conveys the products around 1200 IGA dealer, have fallen by 43 per cent after 2012. This explains the reduction of the debt financing activities, after sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler to stand, and has invested over USD 150 million when calculating the weekly prices of hundreds of products at the same level with Coles and Woolworths, IGA helping resellers to restore their stores by adding faster growing fresh food, as well as bringing the market a better range of private label products.

Chairman of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis worthy of honor rather than criticism of the behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered any third party in the recent storm that has been raging in his friend Nick Kyrgioksen around. He is worthy of glory, rather than criticism of their own behavior, says the Chairman of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy.
"Special Ks" to the younger members called under the name of the talented duo Kokkinakis had to involuntarily publicity of a case where Kyrgios irritated Stan Wawrinka Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly thereafter, the fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati had to twice the referee will separate the Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison each other when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have been hacked Kyrgios, and I had to hack brings a brat."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen to break down his stick after a cramp ruined his potential winnings Richard Gasquetista US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, a young man in Glasgow is competing with Sam Groth second place two games with Bernard Tomic Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I'm pretty strongly of the view that a Thanasi is only pulled by rähinään," Healy said.
He broke his stick because of a cramp when losing the US Open, but he is not the first player who breaks his stick frustrated, and I feel Thanas well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But he has behaved extremely well, also quite provocative situations with the US Open at Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves the praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little harshly.
He is a very mature 19-years of age, he works hard to match by the team and so on, and he never had problems with other players. He is valued in the locker room, he trains hard, it is in good condition and is very calm and mature young man, and in my opinion he should be judged according to their merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take Kyrgiosta According to Friday starting in important games, describing this as "a joint decision between" all good solution, but the subsidies still canberralaisen Employee's return to the team.
"We want the team to be completely focused on the games and all the polemic around [Kyrgiosin]," Healy said.
And Nick has increased very quickly, as, for example, Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he grows up in the public eye, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all received their criticism. However, we are trying to support him, we will try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think that is the best team, and that he, if he had to spend some time out of the public pondering these consequences.

Five Brotherhood members accused of Baruch College first year student's death
Nearly two years after a student died Brotherhood simputusseremoniassa Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains region, a murder charge has been brought against five people.
in New York City Baruch College University, Pi Delta Psi -veljeskunnan members were brutally Chun "Michael" Deng attacked during jäsenyysriitin in September 2013, and was then delayed for taking her to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loads of more than 13-pound backpack full of sand, after which he was repeatedly tackled to the ground when he tried to walk across an icy field towards the goal.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head hurts, after which he lost consciousness.
Brotherhood members did not ring the emergency number Deng's faint, but allegedly waited an hour before you brought him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change clothes Deng, search the web for information about his symptoms, as well as to contact the national chairman of the Brotherhood of Andy Mengiin asking his advice, the police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, members began to hide rituaalivarusteitaan and thus practically put the well-being of the Brotherhood of Michael Deng's over," the police chief said Wagner.
Dengiä not been perking up, and he died the next morning.
Autopsy Protocol, Deng received repeated blows with a blunt object in the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been affected by veljeskuntasimputuksesta, when every year at least one student died as a result, ever since 1970," Doug Fierberg, representing Deng's family lawyer, said in a statement.

This happens when the US central bank to raise interest rates
Raising interest rates will be, and the rising market rates fall, bond yields rise and the economy into a recession.
This we know.
What we do not know is how long all of this will go or how long it will last.
The past does little to provide assistance in terms of timing, it comes specifically to the economy.
The recession has lasted for input after the initial drawdown sometimes only 11 months, sometimes it will be gone for as long as 86 months.
the aggressiveness of the US Central Bank's raising of interest rates has often, though not always, the determining factor in how the economy and the financial assets react.
That is why officials of the US Federal Reserve have so energetically stressed that investors should not focus on it, because interest rates will raise, but rather to go the normalization of the situation in the time of development.
In equation is actually a number of variables.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all hössötys on interest lifting overcapacity.
"The central bank first increase after the global economic crisis will inevitably interpreted in some circles of 'cheap money' era of the end," said päätalousasiantuntija Capital Economics, Julian Jessop global affairs in the message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect that the US interest rate levels gradually return to normal, though still low, the level is such a revolutionary shock, which many seem to be afraid of.
However, this does not mean that it would have an impact.
Below is an overview of how some parts of the economy will react based on the past performance:
As has been seen in the market during the last about a month, waiting for a rate hike may make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes reality, the effect is not quite as dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital will tend to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which in turn may reflect the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the increase of the central bank.
More specifically, in the past approximately 35 years, the market is generally strong, rising by about 14 per cent increase when approached, 250 days after the situation is quite flat (average rise of 2.6 per cent), and the normal state is reached after 500 days, the average return in the last six cycle of 14.4 per cent, multiplied by Nuveen Asset Management -firman leading pääomastrategin Bob Doll in a recent analysis, published in the journal Barron's.
Deutsche Bank shares, the effect is usually clearer later stage of increase of the cycle, when the sales start to fall.
Recessions are part of economic life, but the interest rate lifts often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank is facing a number of challenges that have not previously been the case, and that could accelerate the decline.
This is especially the GDP, which will be the closest to an all-time lowest level before the rate hike the central bank.
According to Deutsche Bank since 1950 conducted 118 lifting the annual nominal GDP has only twice been less than 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, few believe it to remain, the third quarter has reached 1.5 per cent, says the Atlanta federal varantopankki.
increase in interest rates this fragile economy still life can be a risky and raises the question, "Is this time different," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants are prepared for an increase in the Central Bank throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee to the meeting, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the Committee can not accept the increase in this meeting, futures trading predict the probability of only 25 percent.
"Our research shows that since 1950 all korotussyklit have so far appeared to increase the leverage effect of super-cycles, where GDP has surpassed the pre-recession peak very quickly after the recovery has begun," the report says.
By contrast, progress has been exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst period of observation.
The current cycle, the central bank has been waiting the longest by far of the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months now in progress has already been 74 months.
Fixed rate of return has also been unstable while waiting for the market interest rate increases, and the model bears some resemblance to observations made in the capital.
The main difference is that the central bank moved to its line, its effects can be seen in books faster debt than equities.
Bond yield spreads show the direction changing immediately the cycle of the first boost / section of the.
At the end of the cycle, increase in bond yields will fall immediately, "Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategy believe that the increase in interest rates lead to a longer and a shorter-term bond yields convergence, thus paving the yield curve.
High-yielding bonds often produce better in such a situation, even though "we are still cautious with regard to searching for yield," said Schwab's fixed income analyst Kathy Jones in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market is already adapted to the alignment of the expectations of the central bank.
"The strength of the dollar and inflation expectations fall, there are several signs that the market has adapted to tighter monetary policy outlook," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all of these are specific to the market when the central bank has tightened its policy on the.
Generally speaking, companies with business operations located mainly in the United States, will win, when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with large debts, do less well, while the rise in value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on world markets and the debt will be more expensive than what they are funding.
"History shows that the" quality "stocks tend to be more profitable following the first interest rate hike in three months," Goldman Sachs analysts said customers directed to report.
Companies with strong net sales, net sales surpassed the weak companies over the years 1994, 1999 and 2004, after increases an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital and low volatility shares performed better than the low end businesses. First, the average was mentioned in 4 (in percentage points) and the latter 3 (percentage points).
The debt becomes a major problem.
Those companies that have a lot of floating rate loans, are losing the most, Goldman said.
speculative stock outside the consumer has the opportunity to benefit from the rise in value of the dollar.
Also, savers can get a bigger profit income will, even if experts have differing views on how fast the effect is felt.

B & Q boss says that Eastern European laborers are working on cheap popularity behind
Britons are increasingly using the services of apumiesten, Veronique Laury says
Eastern Europe the number of future professional men is rising behind
As a result, targeted to those skilled in Screwfix stores will open 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, the city pääkirjeenvaihtaja Daily Mail magazine

Home Renovation retail chains owns the Kingfisher's new general manager Veronique Laury said that behind the popularity is the number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer services on a ridiculously low price.
This leads to the fact that Kingfisher plans to open 200 new workmen directed Screwfix stores and the closure of 60 B & Q stores.
Laury said that he wants more women to work in B & Q stores, because eight out of ten trade done purchasing decision is expressly made more beautiful by sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more single female households, where people do more home renovation work as before.
Laury said: "The majority of our stores personnel are still men.
We need to seek a better balance.
Half of our customers are, however, women, and 80 per cent of purchasing decisions of products are made by women.

Three ace Board of Directors decided to resort to mandatory legislation in order to save the country's economy.
Visible impact was achieved rather quickly.
SAK and crisp heads of other central organizations of employees began to force the same road, and its result, the country stands on Friday due to a large protest of workers.
Time considered by many at the time also stand sanity.
Asked whether it is worth to strike when things go wrong, anyway.
There is even an established vastarintaliikekin.
Today more than 50 000 people have already been notified by that intend to participate in the demonstration, but goes to work.
The good old days at the time of such a consensus would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no web, in protest, but the declaration of an open scabs would have been a small man-made political suicide.
A million-member trade unions a few tens of thousand people protest not a lot of sway, but it gives food for thought.
The trade union movement position is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
All do not feel the movement as their own goals, values have changed
the attractiveness of the trade union movement's activities from the perspective of drastic solutions to the Board of Directors can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things are rolling for many years shown its own weight, so now finally reached the relevant unions or worker's rights to defend, visible and securely.
The Board of Directors may thus desire to perhaps strengthens the role of the trade union movement, the membership of a trade union is seen as perhaps a more appropriate.
Let's operations organizations, whatever view is, then it is nonsense to say that Friday's mind, the words somehow halt Finland.
Yes Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to fall, and unemployment rises.
These things you would think the imperative for all heads.

Expenses will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the Ministry of finance to be reduced by 2 million and other funding of 3.2 million euros.
The university has a total budget of approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target of ten per cent of the total budget.
against the teaching and research of massive cuts and the reduction of corporate finance at the University of interaction is very important, says Rector Anneli Pauli of the University Bulletin.
Before the summer was affected by the effects of the cuts yet more moderate, but the decline in external funding now appears to be in new dimensions.
Negotiations with the union will be launched next week on Tuesday and will last according to the law for six weeks.

The US central bank must make decisions in the interest rate level
Rest of the world the sidelines, after the US central bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision about whether to withdraw their interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Reuters survey of 80 economist time of a little more than half of those who still believed in the last week the central bank to raise interest rates, now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and the interest rates will be held at the current 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, because after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to zero, is seven years.
For the first time we are approaching a situation where the heart of the central bank has the opportunity to get away from zero, and to start normalizing interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institue for International Economics senior fellow -talousinstituutin.
The US economy has performed relatively well and recovery has brought the balance sheets of trillions of dollars and created a bit of inflation.
However, the central bank can not ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they have to be ready for lifting but the signs indicate they also believe that the odds are against a raise.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20.00 (CET).

University president William LaForge said that between Lambi and Schmidt, to his knowledge been any conflict, but that "clearly Lambi in mind was something".
Authorities said Tuesday that the published on Monday, despite allegations that Lamb would have thought Prentiss was in relation to Schmidt, there was "no information or evidence" of any kind "Love triangle".

Stars, who lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has in recent years been tough.
In 2001, he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime companion Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to rumors, he had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All this really requires a toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months because of a double fracture
Luke Shaw received a double fracture of the right leg of Manchester United's disappearance for PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Although the defenseman was left in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw PREVENT yet to play this season.
Injury caused by Héctor Moreno reckless tackle on 15 minutes after a 20-year-old Shaw was plunged into PSV's area.
He was treated with 9 minutes into the game, and had to give him oxygen before admission into hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture of the leg, and he is now in the hospital."
He was moved to tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then cut in Manchester.
This is terrible. The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from difficulties and after playing brilliantly, and now this.
When I was in the locker room, he had an oxygen mask on.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture will take at least half a year, and he will play in the group stage.
I hope that he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got or red card and a penalty shot.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli is not punished Mexican players.
Van Gaal suggested that an Italian official was mistaken.
You can judge for yourself the situation, when I say that it became a penalty and a red card.
It was really bad tackle two feet.
Shaw tweeted the following: "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell how disappointed I am, my recovery starting now, I will come back stronger."

The English defender has an added incentive to recover next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "It's a really bad injury."
If a player is forced out as a result of such injury, are all very saddened.
Our players never intended to injure an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for the Mexican team Van Gaal against the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno will take this hard, because the aim is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it is a bad thing," Cocu said.
I did not see in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it seemed like he [Moreno] would not touch it, but I did not see Luke's tackling.
Moreno said SBS6 for: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this kind of thing can be.
I feel awful because of this, I'm so sorry. "
PSV's Andrés Guardado was taken to the hospital by Chris Smalling summoned him.
Kai David Cameron Loraxin knows this better?
Every parent soon learns one thing: if your child loves to record something, does not take long at all before it learns almost by heart.
Not only, therefore, if you're David Cameron.
When the service provider of the holiday period childcare asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children's book, he chose Dr Seuss The Lorax book, published in 1971 by the environmental story.
The choice was difficult, writes Cameron published SuperCamps-business website and the message continues: "Funny, poignant, creative, and contains a strong message. I enjoy when I read this book to my children, because it always seems to be found an image or a message, which we have not seen before. "
All this is true, but the next chapter, which presumably Cameron describes the plot of a book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, with a rather short original filling was added new characters and details.
"The inside walls Tarvillen in which all nature has disappeared, and even the air is a commodity, Ted's son hopes to win their dream girl's heart over with filling Audrey's wish to see a real tree," the text says and describes the love story, which in 1991 killed Dr. Seuss, whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not suspicious enough, the text Cameron sounds at times as if it were taken from the Internet Movie Database this website can be found Lorax movie juonitiivistelmästä, which begins as follows: "The inside walls Tarvillen in the city where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, TED boy hopes to win his dreams Audrey, the girl's heart over with. "
Given that Cameron has publicly active senior, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. In a young, nameless boy hears how the local nature is destroyed by greedy, trees cut down and tarviksia kutova magnified, ignoring the name of the issuing story short, moustachioed Loraxista creature who "speaks for the trees".
Such relatively invisible to the PR task has probably been outsourced to an Assistant, which does not seem to have never read the book 20 times in a row for the child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said that the text will become Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was Cameron's staff, but did not comment on the matter at that moment any more.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being cut out of the England team, but it was still a hard place
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen the tour, I do not believe that the repetition of the last times the 3-0 series loss is likely.
I would shut guest breakeven ruled out.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than three years ago the team, but it comes with a good kierrelyöjiä and the team's mindset is strong: they have no scars dating from 2012, just a youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali develops kierresyötöissään and Adil Rashid is the aggressor option, although it is an unknown factor at this level.
Related topics: Adam Lyth fell out of the England cricket team, he will be replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth team is understandably difficult to analyze for me, because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven of his game have been against good attackers in challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are graded on the basis of their results.
the choice of Joe Root, for example, there was no uncertainty before release, because, as I have said before, the players are the best choice factors.
About a hundred points more, and Lythin season the team would be able to continue, but he was personally responsible for their own destiny.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs in Yorkshire, another opportunity arises.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lythin attitude even when he did not perform quite as well as it could have, and does not surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question, how much time a batsman gets the submission quality.
Lyth was elected seven times to the national team, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected to nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and in foreign.
The only gripe is that the English chose Jonathan TROTTIN first to the Caribbean when Lyth was in top condition, but it is the lost opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales comes along, and it is the striker which I appreciate.
He has a cricketer is something that we in Yorkshire we saw early this season, when he scored 236 points against us in the Trent Bridge pitch.
For him, must give at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this of course depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
It is tossed around the idea of Moeenista a cue next to the opening of Cook to the airport to an extra pitcher but must be kept to four high-speed, and I am not against this.
I do not understand why the striker could hit there, and the left-hander has already shown itself to be quite a cricketer.
Moeen not necessarily made the task Worcestershire County kingdom, but he is to them three, and there is not much difference.
The old team mate Justin Langer played the first 38 of his game to the first gate drops, before moving to opening in 2001.
He made three hundred points immediately and recalled the past.
Zafar Ansari will be the team varasyöttäjäksi, and, what little I have with him was dealing with, he seems very impressive young man.
People can look at his unvarnished their own statistics - hitting average of 31, 35 with the ball - and think that it is a gamble, but there is not too much of feeders and the voters chose the young.
He will learn a lot on this tour.

Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene appointment of a consultant to games can prove to be a brainwave.
He is one of the game's nicest guys, and brings with it an enormous amount of experience, because everything is done in all situations and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood will join the white ball games, and brings with it both energy and relentless glimpse.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and he has the same kind of utilizable Allia than Mahelalla.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room to freshen up teams, although their message is the same as in the past.
Collyn team friends in Durham, Ben Stokes, day-long rested, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I at least have no problem with this.

Such decisions will never be made lightly.
Britain leaving the EU (Brexit) advocate can take the profit, if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron to keep the half-woolen re-negotiation strategies of Great Britain in the EU will have day by day more and bigger problems, even without taking into account even a heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn selection of the leadership of the Labour Party or the trade unions, the Confederation of angry Europe on Tuesday.
Also, foreigners have their own Corbyn and Nigel Faragensa.
The European diplomat friend recently explained that since the EU is so deep in a variety of crises, all of which are no fault of their own, some Member States are fed up with Britain's self-centered agenda, which is full of concessions disagreements cause and distracting contract changes that these countries are for the most part do not want to.
The annual meeting in Brighton trade union confederation decided that even that do not want them if they erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George selfieagendaksi.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance or arrive late summits organized in foreign capitals bilateral meetings, taking a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument with either the local or the eye to do without him, and then come home, saying that win support for the reforms.
It's all about me.
The European friend of mine, who wants to Britain, outward-looking EU-panels inside - "Do not leave us alone with the French," says Berlin - suggests that certain capitals of short-sighted ministers and civil servants are now at a point that they do not care, then we go we stay.
Germany's cautious and prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to resign as before it was ruined in the same way as it was too long tarried Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Kohlille (16).
French François Holland Ella is in front of the re-election or replacement in 2017.
He, too, is a fading force.
Poland can point to the nationalist right-wing government, a left-wing Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries to sacrifice on behalf of selfiebrittien when their energies would be better directed in preventing the source of Scotland from the United Kingdom - they do not want it either because of their similar separatistisuuntausten.
So, my friends present, some of these ministers can even plan to do consciously futile comments of the Scottish National Party in the style of Great Britain of the 2017 referendum campaign Brexit to speed up the process.
"The resumption of negotiations was a set-up" and "re-negotiation did not have any significance for Britain."
Europeans have had a bitter experience how voracious Fleet Street newspapers wrote about the know how to be and how the EU-skeptical press alone rulers are, what they were not, Tony Benn, inspired by the 1975 referendum at a time when begun in 1973, our membership was confirmed by the ratio of 2: 1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the majority of the Euro-opportunism, which made a name for himself by writing, "the EU's direct bananas" while the Brussels correspondent for the first half of the 90th century.
Ed Miliband was perhaps silly, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse group of little guys away from other taxes, hacking phones of foreigners and persons domiciled in nominal terms elsewhere and who own most of the big newspapers.
Tony Blair, in fact, the very thought of them as well, but realized that if you are in a cage with a gorilla lustful, bananas must be abandoned because of decoys, unless you want to be the gorilla's lunch menu and later at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was blairilaisempi than Blair himself, with regard to the fight against Cameron's renegotiation trick. Bair was in fact agreed to the principle of the EU behind the rejected Constitution by the French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press did not give it to him, never forgive.
But a nice, Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me kindly on the back of Westminster Parliament House on Monday (I told him that he had no more time to spare me), would appear to be at risk of re-embrace boycotted Neil Kinnock 80s Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake, and then that now.
Although it may take some time, however, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not me, but without a doubt Andrew Marriin by the BBC couch Corbyn set off on Sunday.
Corbyn official status in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says that we would like to remain in the renewed EU.
Outside Well, most of the people of the United Kingdom Independence Party Ukipin war paint-mania, as well as the Conservative Party's wildest nationalist can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, Benn but no-fan" Benn said this, as well as radio and on TV this week, when his inner scouts would have liked to admit that Corbyn choice to appoint John McDonnell harsh shadow finance minister in the government was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his isäpappansa straining on TV, trying to be disloyal to the Labour Party hallituskollegoitaan without, however, would go so far as to lose its place in the government.
Hilary pinnistelyt were more attractive.
But the struggle for that to deal with the "situation anywhere" - Benni utterance - was not what McDonnell said, and by all accounts what Corbyn told the stretcher and MPs in a private meeting on Monday evening.
What any of it is to it non-hierarchical, emotional and personal image, which Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), communications discipline is important hour TV era, and especially social media in the face, which is a breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron free ticket to Europe by allowing her to keep the Labour Party to support the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins at least thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn peruskiertely regarding EU membership (and therefore in line with their Benn's intellectual regulated economy and the anti-capitalist with the past) is no longer just difficult to understand discussion among those left-wing dissidents, to which small differences in narcissism is a key tenet doctrinal bickering in.
As far as his duality of NATO with respect to (Tom Watson is convinced that siitäm Corby campaigns to sell), ulkomaalaisdiplomaattien just have to try to explain it to his superiors.
Why Paris or Berlin's worthwhile to waste political capital (they too are suspicious of voters) concessions to Britain, where it can be completely futile?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed with the weak British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even at the cost of the cutting Conservative government was in power, as I was reminded of Monday's British Influence Security Forum -turvallisuusfoorumin startup.
Experts criticized the Public Health England electric Tobacco ratings
Scientists have said that the state-funded Agency's argument that electric cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional, began a 12-person meeting, where some had links with the tobacco industry.
British Medical Journal (BMJ) write the experts agreed with Lance were criticizing Public Health England (PHE) the evidence used by the report, e-cigarettes.
PHE released this "milestone" report last month, describing it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and pointed to links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
Medical journal The Lancet publication published an editorial last month, which was attacked PHE against the pääjohtopäätöksen "exceptionally shaky base".
Two other BMJ wrote the researchers have wondered whether the claims of "built on a rock or on sand."
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine School in the European Public Health Professor Martin McKee, as well as the University of Liverpool professor of clinical epidemiology Simon Capewell say: "Public health is the main principle that practices need to establish an evidence of the effectiveness of time."
They say that the public expect that PHE, the Opposition "current best estimate of the electric cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes," based on a detailed assessment and modeling evidence.
In fact, it comes from one 12-person meeting, which developed a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions disadvantages, which are combined with a variety of products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting was intensified research.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company nimelä Euro Swiss Health, Director General explains that previously received funding Bristish American Tobacco in for an independent investigation.
He also supporting BAT in public health powers of resistance of the report, they say.
One of the meeting of 12 people announced that it has received funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding, which he is said to have received in the past the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
selection panel members are not told, but the panel includes several well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which also tell the study had received in funding.
The second spot were not known for their expert in tobacco control.
Tobacco leader: The meeting was also attended by PHE.
the research group produced "suggestive admits" that there is a lack of "conclusive evidence regarding the disadvantages of most of the products, and most of the criteria," McKee Capewell and write.
None of these connections or restrictions do not mention the PHE's report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's argument that "so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes works as a route for burning in children or non-smokers" to be premature.
PHE's health and well-being Director Professor Kevin Fenton says that the BMJ set out in objections have been answered in the past.
He says: "Electronic Cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
Half of lifetime smokers will die of dependency.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when compared to the relative dangers of tobacco is so much public epätietoutta.
Nearly 80 000 people die each year from smoking-related disease and smoking costs the NHS annual £ 2 billion.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even if the e-cigarettes are not risk-free, the disadvantages are only a fraction of the traditional tobacco cons - we fulfill our national responsibility.
The BBC's EastEnders should give up, says the former Chairperson Channel 4
Former Chairman from the Channel 4 Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop programs such as EastEnders and The Voice of the dispatch, and that commercial competitors "would give anything" of such hits as this, for example, be located in Albert Square street soap series.
Johnson said that the license fee should only be used to make the programs that other British broadcasters will not do.
He criticized the BBC that it will put the programs of the public service, are likely to have a smaller audience, broadcasting to difficult times against the most watched programs of competitors and the public-interest channels, as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the company wants to do more to cooperate with other organizations, Johnson said that he came to Channel 4's once six years to establish a relationship with the BBC, to no avail.
"I do not understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts programs that would fit clearly in unsubsidised competitors," Johnson said of Lords Communications Committee as part of its research into the BBC's future.
If the license fee is considered on - and I'm not sure that it would be for this communications device or the long-term good idea - it should at least limit their production to programs that others do not do and produce.
The Voice is sent to the transmission time of the most important, because the future is to collect as much support.
The idea that no one else seems to the program, is a joke, it's ridiculous, it is clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why the regressive tax should finance programs that could be financed without state aid.
The Voice is a one of a kind and EastEnders second, admittedly carried out in-house.
Frankly, the other channels would give anything for it.
I do not understand how it is a matter of public service broadcast.
I do not think that it would undermine the BBC. S at all "
Channel 4 s in 2004-2010 led to a serial entrepreneur Johnson said that the BBC is guilty of hunting, the number of viewers, "because the people working there objectives, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He comments on the BBC's popular series reminiscent of the former leader Tony Ball, Sky's comments. He used the 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC would sell kits such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller audience of public service programs "go BBC4 for, which often can not be measured by the amount of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfilling the responsibilities and can then £ 4 billion in license fee revenue defending a hypocritical to say that" of course, we just do all of these unknown programs, which no one can see. ' "
They put them to the point where no one will ever come and see them.
License fee regarding Johnson said the committee: "I challenge you to look regressive system of who gets the most value for it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that the cost of £ 150 a year, gets a lot of money, but I do not know if this is true for those people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money, because they do not use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5's director David Elstein, who also testified to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate the time made it REITH "to inform, educate and entertain".
He said that only a small part of the BBC's output is now classified as training - he said the figures are 1% of the TV-production and 0.1% on the radio - and that it should follow the Australian and Canadian Broadcasting to change the mission to "inform, educate and entertain ".
As for the questions of partnership, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which according to him is shown on television only Some fishes, and teaming up with commercial companies, so that they all should be viewed online.
"Äänigenetiikka" allows brain cells to control the sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change direction as soon as the sound impulse strikes them.
Researchers have increased the worms, which is genetically modified neural systems, so that they can be manipulated ääniaaltopurkauksilla.
The tiny nematodes change direction immediately after the hitting sound impulse, which is too high to be heard by the human ear.
Pulses function to turn on the motor neurons of the genetically engineered with ultrasonic waves responsive to the membrane channels.
Related Topics: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that worms show a new, äänigenetiikaksi designated, the operation of the method. In the ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body by hand.
California's Salk Institute in La Jolla researcher Sreekanth Chalas told The Guardian that the method could one day replace syväaivostimulaation. It is an invasive procedure in which the human brain into electrical impulses for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes are not normally react on ultrasound, but Chalas found that when the surrounding liquid having a microscopically small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles confirmed by ultrasound waves, which are then run in worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves affecting the TRP ion channels 4, structures, some of which are of worms in the cell membranes.
The sound waves get these ion channels to open and activate the adherent cells, explains the report published in the journal Nature Communications.
To prepare the steerable ultrasonic nematodes, worms Chalas modified genetically so that part of the nerve cells is 4 TRP ion channels.
When Chalas used ultrasound to custom worms, micro-bubbles confirmed by the sound of waves and submitted them to worms, which they turn on the custom motor neurons.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, ground-breaking tool that gives scientists the ability to connect the nerve cells on and off by using pulses of light.
However Chalas says that there sonogenetiikan may have some advantages over the optogenetics.
Unlike the light that must be transmitted along the optical fiber to a desired location within the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass freely through the fabric, so that they can be sent to the top of the skull to the brain.
"We believe that the gene therapy and the therapeutic use of the virus may be able to get in on the human nerve cells momentarily react ultraäänisignaaliin certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting," said Chalas.
Other application objects could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Sixten Korkman wrote the chapter on capital topicality -kirjaan: "Marx should become familiar with"
The global economic crisis have raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and published in the years 1867-1894 his main work Capital, write the Communist Party's former chairman Yrjö Hakanen known today published the book Marx's Capital topicality.
"He was taken more seriously now than in a long time", Hakanen write the foreword.
Marx's estimates of the capitalist economic development, internationalization and penetration of increasingly all areas of life, the concentration of capital and money capital and fictitious capital, the growing role have proved remarkably prescient.
Hakasen organized by the list-based capital-seminars can be found in the book also Professor at Aalto University, a respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
Korkman write a book of Marx to be topical, "now and forever".
I do not think the former Managing Director of the Finnish Economy Research Institute and the Confederation of Finnish delegation, however, is not a Marxist?
Not after all.
Korkman tells the phone that he did not like Marx topical talousajattelijana but rather as an interesting social theorists.
Today, the social sciences are more diversified and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary connoisseur.
"The usual understanding is that the history of ideas about the dead men wrong opinions," Korkman start.
It is true that Marx's predictions went drastically wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial revolution, he pulled the early days of capitalism consuming too far to conclusions, Korkman says.
But Korkman, however, sees the value of Marx's radical attitudes.
"Marxissa more relevant is the fact that he asked good questions," he says.
Now let's discuss Marxinkin areas of interest such as the distribution of wealth again.
"Marx could perhaps provide inspiration for anyone who wants to understand the big picture, as a result of the technical revolution in the changing world", Korkman analyzed.
But in what the government should decide tomorrow, not Marx not help.
His mielestäänhän capitalism was a hopeless case, which should just quit.
Yet Marx believes that you should become familiar with Korkman.
'70s, Marx could not read, "says Korkman.
"The Maoists and the Trotskyists and other sects hated all of capitalism, but even more to each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and also Marx can be approached without back over the ideological and political baggage.
"Every social scientist should become familiar with Marx's idea of the world - like other classics," says Korkman.

Different parts of the Finnish will be held on Friday, the local protests.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and protests?
Trade Unions on Friday organized a big demonstration has is in many ways an interesting and unusual.
For example, it can not be found in Finnish political history of a very good point of comparison, says the University of Jyväskylä Professor of Sociology Emeritus Martti Siisiäinen.
As such, it is no wonder that the trade union movement to protest.
If it does not do so, it would raise the front of the Government of hands up, says Siisiäinen.
Well-right government has hit the Finnish tradition of corporatism to the substance - and also in places that have been important in terms of the development of the Finnish welfare state.
Board brutality lack of contract law.
This is a lot of features that the trade union movement really trying to get to his knees.
At the same time the trade union movement is the place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the trade union movement by no means all employees to support the Friday demonstrations.
What's new now is the sharp division that's demonstration causes in that group, which the trade union movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Finnish gathered from different parts of the unemployed demonstrated in the Parliament building in November 1993.
If Friday's protests Seeking a point of comparison, it could be left unemployed in the demonstration, organized in 1993 Rupture Thursday, says Siisiäinen.

Now the government and the trade union movement intervals are perhaps even worse than at the time of puberty Thursday.
Besides, power is now very Finnish right-wing government ever, says Siisiäinen.
The current governing coalition is still in the way of interest, that it is so tight right-wing True Finns, despite the talk.
Even jytkyn time there was a certain old elements of the labor movement.
Are expected on Friday, several thousand protesters.
The demonstration also stops for public transport and possibly closes the day-care centers and schools.
Although the demonstration has allowed employees undivided support, it could become the biggest in years.
is organized around 300 demonstrations in Helsinki annually in recent years.
They are from side to side.
Traditionally, the Finnish trade union movement's demonstrations have been relatively quiet - even though policies have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish rally to avoid conflict, we are law-abiding.
Protesters try to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Siisiäinen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new impetus.
The demonstration turned into a culture.

Media Researcher: Sipilä take a big risk
Sipilä, the communication required for a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among many others.
Also, this kind of direct speech channels are needed in the future.
This will not be the last time only, Sipilä said to reporters in parliament.
Sipilä did not want to even estimate how frequent way to the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches will be.
Sipilä, the speeches will not necessarily always be passed on YLE channels.
If other channels enrolls channel, so then we will see.
Now, tonight is used this channel, Sipilä said.
Sipilä According to the Finnish economic situation is so serious that it requires television and radio speech holding citizens.
This whole thing, what we are talking about, is quite complex and requires a longer argument.
That's why we chose this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech is sent to the clock from 21.05 to 21.20 and TV1 on the radio in Finland.
It may also look at Yle Areena.
Sipilä take a big risk
Media Researcher hopes that Sipilä television speech reflect a more general inward turning of the Board.
Is it an attempt to take a public debate on the definition of the right to more tightly into their own hands and refuse Research questions for public debate? says a professor at Stockholm University Anu Koivunen.
It reminds me of Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini's recent comment that he follow the media agenda and not let it define itself.
in the name of democratic debate and public hope that these issues are not linked.
Koivunen understand that the commercial media are indignant Sipilä advertisement.
It would be strange if the media field does not react.
Policy makers communication styles do not notice things in a democracy.
The task of media representatives must, by definition, seek to the fact that the agendas of politicians taken as given.
According to Koivunen, television Sipilä speech is a big risk.
Sipilä speech should bring to the table something new and special, set to voice the exceptionally high expectations were met.
Does today serves more what we have already heard?
Or if he can speak different tone, a different way or in different words or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there will be just more of the same old, have to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
Ylekin to take this risk in mind, if there is not a special situation but routine voice among many others.
There is a risk that the Yle be branded to communicate with politicians or parliament and the government, which is certainly not in the interests of Excessive or public line.
Sipilä cunning bet
Sipilä's upcoming speech is also important is what the Prime Minister left unsaid, media researcher emphasizes.
The evening will watch closely what Sipilä is missing and what is not, says the University of Jyväskylä research coordinator Heikki Kuutti.
Kuutin according to TV Sipilä speech is a clever bet, because this is how this can bring your views known without some dissenting voices.
This message provides the general public without any journalistic filter, as opposed to the press conference, where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypass the media and speak directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will interpret the speech something not right, because the more specific issues can not reach the present.
Kuutin, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - valuuko perspiration, with trembling hands.
He compares Sipilä father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä able to present his case well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the Government would inform about something, because this man as if speaking directly to another person.
This kind of (US President Barack) Obama and devout partners on a regular basis.
A truly exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo to keep the Prime Minister's speech to citizens truly exceptional.
According to him, there is no place for decades, the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister would like this to get sympathy because the Finns to blackmail.
Workers organizations organized a demonstration on Friday and strikes against the government's actions.
Paavo Arhinmäki chairman of the Left Alliance says on Twitter that Sipilä could keep the state of the nation speech to parliament the Prime Minister's declaration, in which case the speech may be achieved even discuss.

Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can halt the mind and distressing, he says.
However, if the child has come across the television news images of refugees or heard of the matter from somewhere else, it's worth taking into speech.
The discussion is a good starting point to visit the child and listen carefully to what he asks.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily those of the parent imagines her to be afraid of.
The child should not be intimidated in vain, even though the self haunting and pelottaisikin.
The smaller the child is closely monitoring the behavior of their parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, a child feels safe.
The older children are likely to collide with the discussion of the refugees at school, with friends or the Internet.
Parents are good to take with them broach the subject, wondering if that child.
The fact is that all people in the world have things well.
Parents can work together with children to think about how our family to this perceived.
Does the world believe that in the end, however, safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have a variety of educational perspectives - some of you may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult issues, the child receives a model of how to deal with life in front of the difficulties ahead.
This can be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children to help lower"
Your forces at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child
Vermo slamming ball is difficult to control the flash
Perttu Pohjola was milled Clover tuimaan Ball lightning strike in mid-summer.
It trotted only victories and second berths, until the end of July in Tampere races came the collapse.
As the stallion clotted thoroughly, the coach suspected that something was wrong and ordered his protégé time vet.
Explanation survived the time to go off endoscopically.
The horse had laryngitis.
Disease did not reach the mildest, but it required two Beating course of medicine.
Because of clover Thunderball had to be a light exercise, Pohjola says he is pleasantly surprised by the horse's last race.
It was the second time in Turku record SE-mare after Tarun Wind.
Clover Thunderball was back on court very paineissaan, when it had been driven normally only a few weeks.
Those things, taking into account the small bending of the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that the condition of competition made the stallion blade.
The horse went on sentiment certainly ahead, and hopefully it should also be stabilized.
Clover Ball Lightning has been a so-called humor horses.
When it does not feel like it has been able to throw a screw things up without illness.
On a good day a stallion has instead come off a lightning sprints that opponents have been stumped.
Shorty with the speed of the competitors are not doing Ball Lightning, which comes off even lämminverimäiset rides.
Pohjola hopes to Vermo peesijuoksu.
However, the different thing is how Clover Thunderball agrees.
It is pretty hard time of departure and may even slink beneath the starting car boom, and that sort of thing.
Hopefully, the stallion would have been more peaceful than the output of Turku.
Clover Thunderball will be able to come in shape while on the bow, and we will drive on the profits out of the coach's permission.
This is why you can not get rid of the unnecessary iPhone programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least part of Apple's iPhone phones come with the future programs can maybe sometime in the future to remove - but not quite all.
Apple will be in the future to remove some of its own programs iPhones, says the company's CEO Tim Cook in an interview with BuzzFeed magazine.
Apple iPhone can be found in a series of programs, which are relatively sparse use: For example, FaceTime calls, Newsstand, Health, Stocks, Podcasts and tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which entered into force as an upgrade iPhones, even if it is only necessary for Apple's wearable owners.
Cook the elimination of Apple software is more complex thing than to show off.
Some of the applications are linked to one another on the iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says BuzzFeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone apps work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work that way.
So, with time, I think that we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple will therefore investigate the matter, as the company does not want to waste storage space for users' iPhones.

US Fed is trying to tighten monetary policy next
The United States following the recession begins to peak less than a year, but more likely within three years after the country's central bank Fed will take a long time to again raise interest rates.
And the decline in the financial markets begin to turn before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted start raising interest rates possibly as early as this week and no later than the end of the year.
So, the next recession may weigh on top of a peak by next autumn and financial markets kurssirytinä it before.
Or at least that is the case, if the world's largest economy and the financial markets operate as they have been in the habit - and if they react to the Fed's monetary tightening taps as they are done before.
Such conclusions are arrived at a German bank Deutsche Bank London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker of comprehensive long-term economic cycles and market research.
Bank of distributors in more than 60 pages Long-Term Asset Return Study research report for major international clients last week.
The study and the report drawn up by strategists do not deceive they know exactly when to take the Fed to raise interest rates or what happens in the economy and the market thereafter.
Instead, they show the economic statistics of the cool facts and calculations to see how the economy and the markets have in the past behaved in the Fed's interest rate increases and the time after.
In addition to historical observations, they look at what the key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or another model than the previous rate hikes are achieved - and what are the possible consequences.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial market are now huterammassa condition to withstand an increase in interest rates than ever before since the 1950s.
the beginning of the recession may not be all years
The Fed's monetary policy and the stance of the respective leaders are to decide along last summer and early autumn hinted that the time is beginning to be ripe to raise rates.
The first rate hike in over nine years to try as early as this week.
Case solved within Wednesday and Thursday, the Fed's Board of Governors so-called Open Market Committee meets to decide on a two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised the so-called Fed funds rate -ohjauskorkoaan in June 2006.
Then ended exactly two years of relatively regular but small at a time by 0.25 percentage point rate hikes series, which the Fed raised interest rates to 1.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
The financial markets symptoms began in 2007, the United States Risky mortgage financing difficulties, and a year later the financial crisis tore a global doomsday nightmare.
Great recession came in 2009.
The last time serious setbacks in the financial markets and the real economy began more slowly than after previous Fed rate hikes has typically been the case.
Similarly, the trials were then tougher and more rugged than at any time since the 1930s Depression.
Deutschen strategists have screened the world's major economies ups and downs and twists and turns of the financial markets since 1950 and in some areas since the early 1800s.
The Fed's rate hikes and the economic and financial effects they will report to the 1950s onwards.
The onset of the recession has passed since the first interest rate hike fastest time in less than a year, mostly children under three years and an average of less than three and a half years.
Financial market price rise has ended two-years after the commencement of the Fed's interest rate hikes.
The Fed has alternately raised and alternately dropped its key interest rate since the early 1950s, a dozen different length cycles.
Each one is different from others in some respects, and the narrator is relatively little analysis, so they can hardly be the basis to conclude with any certainty the impact of the next interest rate hikes.
Strategists point out that, at this time, many things will be different.
And not just the better.
Interest rates too low for too long
determining the causes of the financial crisis, let alone the guilty does not necessarily bring out clearly even decades of research work.
But three factors that led to the crisis and its destructive power increased their reasons must be very clearly defined:
1) The Fed, euro zone, the ECB and other world's major central banks kept their 2000s policy interest rates too low for too long.
They paikkailivat techno bubble traces, and at the same time increased their following.
2) The financial and in different parts of the real economy over the decades, and the already accumulated excessive amount of debt increased by central banks ylilöysän the impact of monetary policy even more enlarge.
The result was the biggest debt bubble in history economy held so far.
3) In particular, the financial economy approximately pidäkkeittä compacted mad cheap debt financing swelled to most financial market segments of the economy held so far in the history of the biggest price bubbles in real estate shares, bonds and commodities.
It either is unlikely to arise very fierce controversy that elevated rely more and more complex velkavipujen the heights of the financial markets were unusually dangerous and unstable in good shape, the Fed and other central banks recently drove interest rates up.
tuned Velkavipujen supported by fiscal structures, let alone appreciation of the bubbles did not last as the time after the rate hikes had begun and debt financing costs were increasing.
The risks were realized as a financial crisis, and was followed by the Great Recession.
The larger the bubble, and more debt
Deutschen strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give tuumailun the subject by mentioning such as the following:
1) the Fed and other major central banks are now kept its monetary policy stance still lighter, even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were before the crisis for too long been too low, they have now been even longer still lower.
2) Indebtedness is not for a long time been a mad cheap as ten years ago, but now the debt money is the cheapest, literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the financial and the real economy debt cargo is not lighter, but now in different parts of the economic ones are brimming with plenty of heavier debt load than before the financial crisis, or for that matter have ever been.
3) increasingly more rapid and less costly central banks left the issue of liquidity is for the most part remained the financial market and the main hilannut securities and asset allocation, then the most expensive in the pre-crisis peak or never.
And the strategists enjoying the atmosphere of a financial market warning signs, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the recession in decades heaviest in the model than was previously the case.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
The real economy is in other words an unusually poor condition but on the financial market pressures and risks are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next take to tighten rahahanojaan tighter.
Perhaps the French bank Societe Generale strategist Albert Edwards' vision is not as strange as at first glance may be affected.
He has for some time been coached in the bank's international investor-customers following the Fed's U-turn:
First, the Fed will raise interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon the Fed is time flies extinguish financial fires even higher QE-raharuiskuilla.

Ahtisaari Guardian: The West rejected the Russian proposal for al-Assad to displacement
Western countries rejected the more than three years ago, Russia's bid to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have been to abdicate, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, Russia's UN envoy proposed the plan, which al-Assad would be some time after the power receded in style.
Western countries do not, however, taken up the proposal because they believed al-Assad's fall anyway within a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis, in 2012 the United Nations with the five permanent member of the Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian envoy Vitaly Tshurkin listed for him the private conversation three point plan: to arm the opposition is not received, the opposition and al-Assad had to immediately get a voice connection and abandonment of al-Assad's power had to be carried out discreetly.
I know Tshurkinin.
We do not necessarily have all the things agree, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said that, sit down, Martti, I'll tell you what we need to do, Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari says Tshurkinin conveyed a message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the magazine conversation, but According to Ahtisaari, it is not two words.
Also, UN diplomats refused to comment on Ahtisaari's allegations, but said that al-Assad's forces were already at that time made a number of massacres and the main opposition groups refused to all contracts, which he would have remained in power.
the former head of the British Foreign Ministry's Middle East department, Sir John Jenkins takes Ahtisaari's speeches hesitantly, because of his experience in Russia had never been willing to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported the al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point of Ahtisaari's argument is that Tshurkin spoke of the Moscow delegation.
If he would have told me Tshurkinin speeches, I responded that I would hear the same President Vladimir Putin, so I take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have even if suspected that there had been a ploy to keep Putin in power in one of the al-Assad supporter.
Refugee Power your tekosiamme
During Ahtisaari's negotiations between the Syrian crisis, had died about 7 500 people.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the current year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is their own tekosiamme.
I see no other option than to take good care of these people raukoista.
We are now paying the landing, which itself causes, Ahtisaari says the magazine.
Asylum seekers arrangement center wanted to participate in Tornio
Board designed to northern Finland arrangement for asylum seekers center is likely to be set up in Tornio.

The Interior Ministry has been looking for a suitable place to the need to better manage the influx of refugees from the border to Sweden.

Vice-President of Tornio City Council Sauli Hyöppisen (left.) that it is not true.
When the whole council had not been gathered together, and of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to call the council meeting next Monday to decide on the issue, he explains STT.
Spot colloquium had 36 delegates out of 43.
The arrangement Center objected to 13 delegates.
On this basis, one would expect a decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.

The expert has conducted an inspection visit, that it could be suitable for such use.

Sipilä still hopes the labor market options for extortion
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center.) That there was public holiday to halve the money would take care of only a part of the government from pursuing the work of putting the price.
The Board of Directors may, however, according to him, would welcome alternative to the package, if the social partners manage to agree on such.
Sipilä told reporters in parliament that he has not been in contact with the labor market organizations.
He also did not know how seriously organizations are looking for ways to replace the Board of Directors indicated by labor racketeering.
If such an agreement is reached, we will take it no more welcomed as part of the overall package.
Holiday halving the coins would be Sipilä believes that as a means of acting as a transaction in almost all wage earners as opposed to, for example, outlined by the government Sunday supplements surgery.
The social partners could agree among themselves on vacation the money surgery, because they are recognized in the law rather than collective bargaining.
The government says these views Wednesday of next week to Parliament a communication to the Government's labor racketeering.
Sipilä according to proposals from such organizations should be aware of this before.
The final deadline for this does not exist.
Legislative leaves moving about, or the train is moving, and it goes on all the time difficult.
Now is a very time.
After all, in such matters go long if the will is there, Sipilä designers.
published by the government last week, will focus on the changing Epiphany and Ascension Day public holidays as unpaid annual work time shortening.
In addition, the first days of sick leave salary is cut, overtime pay is halved, Sunday compensation be reduced by 75 per cent and holidays shall be shortened.

The central organizations of employees organize activities due to major demonstration on Friday, in addition to a number of trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi council passed mahlahallin warehouse extension
Tohmajärvi council passed unanimously but a little grumbling of Nordic Koivu Ltd's management, ie mahlahallin warehouse extension.
Reviews arose from the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally spoken.
There is also a busy schedule of heartburn.
Even more low wondered, that there is no need for status was unknown a year ago, when it was decided the previous extension.
At this point, 400-450 per square meter warehouse extension was approved investment program, but the money be decided later in the context of interim report.
Still on the agenda talked about the investment of EUR 150 000-200 000, but meeting the technical director Erkki Ikonen told reporters that the price will be approximately EUR 300 000.

Karelia kielellekin place in Joensuu
The City mitigated by a more radical position to bring Karelian-language street name signs to the center of Joensuu.
The new decision is an important and correct thinking Karelian tradition preservation across the province.
Joensuu is not julistaudu Karelian language in the capital, because there is no historical basis and the Karelian language is an intrinsic part of the identity of the area.
spoken language in the Joensuu region has been part of more eastern savonian dialects.
Even after the decision of the new city center should not be Karelian street name plates.
However, the city of Joensuu is a good discretion on a case ready for the Karelian language use, for example, information boards and in the marketing of tourism.
The same reasoning city recommends to all other operators.
Although Joensuu is officially unilingual municipality, and also the use of Karelian language is best viewed generously, now that multiculturalism is alive and strong changes in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still the province's special features, as well as the image of Joensuu, the capital of the whole Finnish forest.
They both may well be used for the benefit of the province in a variety of marketing.
Train connections liquidations cut the province's vitality
Train connections cuts hit the province's vitality heavy hand.
Transport links directly affect the province's economy and competitiveness.

The company also said it plans to hire approximately 55 000 seasonal employees during holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50 000 seasonal employees during holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent of the opening of the auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. says it will wait until next May to end of the tax year result of $ 10.40 to 10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting a $ 10.84, multiplied by FactSet poll.
Smaller outlook came despite an average of 4.9 per cent price increases, which come into force on the day of january 4, and despite that began in November of higher surcharges for heavy or large packages in land transport.
The company said that it expects operating profit growing from the previous year, because they have cut costs, turnover has increased, and e-commerce is on the rise.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "is performing strongly, taking into account the weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in the production and global trade."
The plans' pay for the duration of your stay was announced a day after rival UPS reported that plans to hire 000 extra employees from 90 to 95, about the same as it hired last year.

Federal Reserve policy makers this week to sit in two days around the tremendous mahonkipöydän long-awaited meeting led, whether the come time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end decorative central bank, the two layers of meeting rooms has a wall painting in the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues will make the financial interests of the nation above all else.
The Congress has fallen on the shoulders of the central bank dual responsibility: they need to maximize the US employment and keep prices stable.
After the Great Depression of the leaders of the central bank are, however, accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is this third requirement can be a decisive factor in the decision be published on Thursday, which is so tight that it can not even be predicted. The decision on whether the US economy is ready to be weaned record-high incentive to short-term interest rates which until the end of 2008 remained close to zero brought.
Although most of the data shows the economy is growing strongly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets can be made in advance alert to the officials of the central bank more säikymmiksi, which will increase instability. There are fears, how affected if the federal funds rate would be raised even -viitearvoa quarter percentage point.
"Understandably, the labor market and inflation are the first and the most important factors, which are monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co. päätalousasiantuntija.
"But I think that if they are looking for legitimacy in interest rates unchanged for the submission, the increased uncertainty in the world market has enough valid grounds still waiting," he says.
The central bank's decision is not a consensus, which is already too gives rise to the nervousness economy.
According to Bloomberg, a recent survey, about half of economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets, while waiting for the central bank to delay raising as a key indicator for the possibility of the growth is only about 30 per cent.
This refers to the decline in the securities markets, if the central bank to raise the level, if policy makers succeed then soften the blow by promising that the next drawing will not happen in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, a new chapter in the 16 599.85.
Recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank to keep the same level this week, says John Lonski, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group -rymän päätalousasiantuntija.
"It is surprising, if the central bank to raise interest rates right now," he says.
If the decision-makers will raise interest rates, "they need to see a lot of the decisions we make the effort to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Some experts argue that the increased level of reassurance to financial markets, since it removes the uncertainty about when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be this month, raising interest rates a quarter percentage point, thus taking the first small steps towards a slow tightening of monetary conditions, guaranteeing the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has pointed out in the spring and early summer, that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that the Liberals require appeals more to economic development.
Although job creation slowed in August, the growth rate of the labor market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1 percent, which is the lowest figure in seven years, and close to the level at which the central bank to keep full employment limit.
Wage growth has shown signs of picking up.
Although inflation is still less than 2 percent of the annual target central bank, policy-makers, the Central Bank the main reason for this is a temporary effect considerably A lowered the price of oil.
Economy "can handle additional interest rate levels and also needs them, taking into account the tight situation in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics company päätalousasiantuntija.
However, the financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index fell by up to 16 percent of the May highs, as investors feared China's slowing economy to slow down in global growth.
The market has recovered from this month, to some extent, and the Dow index is now nearly 10 percent below the May peak reading.
Central bank policy makers market turmoil is an additional factor in the complex equation that says because the interest rate should be increased.
"Without these financial market events and news of recent weeks, China's economic weakness, policy makers would intensify the level of this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate Centre senior researcher and a former official of the Central Bank.
Now, he predicts that decision-makers are waiting for at least a month in order to get a better idea of the effects.
"The possible effects on the US economy are still very unclear, and they do not have much information at its disposal, with regard to the consequences of the events in China," Oliner says.
International economic well-being is not the main concerns the central bank, so in principle it should not influence the decision-making process.
In practice, however, the federal central bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank influence has been enormous.
In 2013, the then chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, hint that the central bank can be "narrowed" to increase the money supply, caused upheaval in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined together, the central bank officials are expected not only to the next development elsewhere, including to consult with other central banks and experts in order to get a better understanding of the world economy.
Central Bank's decision-making process is "more of an art than a science," says Zachary Karabell, an asset management company Envestnet Inc. Head of the Global Strategy.
in the State of Virginia in Richmond Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank), President Jeffrey Lacker noted this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted mobilisations of financial markets, which has affected to be separated from the fundamentals of the economy."
A decision-making Federal Open Market Committee committee has called for a rate hike, and Lacker, a member of the Committee of the right to vote, citing as an example the years 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian financial crisis caused the central bank cut the reference value of 0.75 percentage points over a three-meeting 'in spite of its limited, recognizable effects of the US economic growth, "Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank set aside these cuts.
The central bank should put economic stability given priority only during the great crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of koronmäärittämiskomitean the Bank of England (Bank of England).
Recent turmoil does not come anywhere near the level of Posen says.
"No one wants a situation where raising interest rates is feared, therefore, that the market harmistuvat", Chairman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute, Posen says.
Federal Law on the Central Bank (Federal Reserve Act) to keep still my includes a dual requirement, and no mention economic stability. As long as this is the case, in my opinion, they should not anticipate it.

Bariatric surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
New research shows that mildly obese type 2 diabetics benefits received weight loss surgery can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say, living on these mildly obese diabetic patients after weight loss surgery longer than those treated by other methods than the surgery.
"Getting mortality data takes a long time," Dr. Robin Blackstone says. He is a weight loss surgery specialist who wrote an editorial to the new research on the links JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss, or bariatric surgery, various methods are used to reduce stomach size.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, ProcedurePak tray cuts have been found to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of the persons participating in the study has been morbidly obese, and their body mass index (BMI) was 35 or more.
BMI, or weight ratio of the length is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If your BMI is above 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person's BMI is over 30, he is considered to be obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used since 2007 the data collected to compare the two kinds of bariatrista surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gastric reduction, type 2 diabetes for medical treatments in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of people cut decreased from 31 to 24.5: by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the persons who were treated by means other than surgery, BMI remained at roughly the same in 29.
Cut 36 per cent of people with diabetes improved completely and 28 percent partially.
In comparison, medically treated group improved diabetes altogether only 1 per cent, and in part, approximately 2 per cent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol in "were generally better cutting group," the authors concluded.
The researchers followed the patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c value should remain below 7 percent, the researchers write.
Postoperative hemoglobin A1c level fell by about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, the group of medical treatment, it remained stable at around 8 per cent.
This is better than "glycemic control", which improved hemoglobin A1c levels illustrate, however, did not reduce mortality in five years, says principal investigator Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results from the two different cutting type.
Fifth year mark, as compared sleeve gastrectomy tested in a group, become gastric bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg) decreased more painoindeksiään (7.4 and 5.1), decreased hemoglobin A1c more -tasojaan (3.1 per cent and 2.1 per cent), and were more likely to reach a complete diabetesremission (46.9 per cent and 16.7 per cent).
University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that, although the study did not show any survival or surgery, after five years, there has been research in Sweden, where the surgery resulted in longer life weighty humans.
A Swedish study found that weight loss surgery käyneillä obese were 29 percent less likely to die from a 15-year period, when they were compared with a group that had tried traditional treatments.
Although the new study did not show any improvement in surgical survival, Blackstone says, however, that the results are encouraging for people with a BMI of less than 35 and who are interested in the surgery.
"The results are conclusive precisely in the fact that they show that the surgery is a safe lower BMI group" and does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds both patients and their doctors should be taken very seriously by weight at the time when the patient has a BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we are waiting too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when a man has collected these genetic changes, which are permanently prepare his body to obesity and diabetes, the withdrawal of the situation is very difficult.

The fundamental thing is to think about how we can reduce the killing of their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never been addressed these problems, "he added.
In taking position on the question of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on Bush's action 9/11-after terrorist attacks and claimed that the United States caused a violent response to violent chain of events.

Why testify to his execution in Oklahoma
If any legal intervention does not take place, later on today, I believe, the man executed.
If that happens, and I hope that no, I sit in the gallery viewers Oklahoma State Penitentiary -vankilassa watching, when Richard Glossip executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the death of the four official witnesses.
Received a request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I'm starting terrified of this day as it approaches.
So why I agreed to?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the full story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Suppliers of course, have the opportunity to keep track of executions in America, and because the applications is often more than the seats available, participants will be selected through a horrible draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the places reserved for the media from twelve to five.
Whoever is selected then all, considers the event cool.
I can not do it.
I'll sit next to Richard Glossipin closest friends, and I created him to calls made during your connection is months and one two and a half hour through the visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often we talked.
The prison authorities say, I can not be a witness, as well as the supplier, so I can not be with me a notebook and pen to record've ever seen.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One oklahomalainen journalist accused on Twitter that I am compromising impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of a prisoner of his wishes, so you can participate.
I complained to the supplier.
Haan admitted that "could have set a better word," but must still believe that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has been in disagreement with some of my messages, and I wrote things with.
He did not tell me what I need to write, and I would do so even if he would say.
I told him, that he may at any time remove me from the witness list basin.
But he wants to, that there is an international journalist who writes on the matter.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the publicity will help the death penalty oppositional trend.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is by my side.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to make with a series of podcasts.
I will not go through this again all the details.
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of his actions Barry Van Treesen would make him a case of culpable complicity.
But I believe that there is a very strong possibility of the fact that he is not guilty of murder.
I think certainly that the death penalty in qualifying was not enough evidence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And this then is the perspective from which I look at him to die.
I can not claim to be completely impartial.
There will be other suppliers who will take care of it.
Here I give you a description of how it feels to look at the man, which I like, will die needlessly.

They knew that the situation continued.
Sometimes you just need to react and to live with the sanction and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home today, and I sleep well.
I want to go upright and I would like owners to think that I will do my best for them.
When they start to think differently, then I should not continue as coach.
Then I would have to consider what I do to the license.
Previously, Moody drop a bomb racing.com-site interview, in which he said that lahjomattomuusosasto had tried to spy on his talliaan.
"One and a half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with the man - I name him when asked - and offered him a job talleillani if he would pass information about what to do there.
They obviously see me as a charlatan.
If that is so, surely they would be separated from their lawyers, because they have failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the Racing Victoria, David Moodie, Racing Victoria's current Chairman, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of the issue at the time and are aware of today.
Should I start to think that this is getting personal?
Is Victoria Racing finally decided to masculine and perhaps to shift the responsibility to others as coaches about what is happening in the field?
If I have a detrimental sector?
Am I so harmful to the sector?
Perhaps people think so.
Maybe they need to export the license and push me aside, and I do not at all doubt that my message now, things might get them to think about just that.
But I'm at the point now that I do not care anymore, and it suretaa me.
It really saddens me.
Pressuring them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown Lidarin kobolttitutkimuksen long time, and late rejection led him to declare that could "throw a license across the table."
Moody, who is best known as an invincible champion Black Caviar coaching, has invited the rule on the race-day management "ridiculous" after the mud or savihaude has been placed in the horse's legs, which is unlawful.
"It is against the rules of the competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on its feet.
It could have been a bath last night.
It might have been yesterday, as it was.
It was the race day.
Moodylla may be facing a three-month non-competition due to race day haudehoidon, which officials began their investigation.
It is a joke.

Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could barely make it to cover up its reference to the Stormiin after it won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night final qualifier. Bennett called the game of rugby league's "showcase" and said that the two Queensland teams were "very enthusiastic" in wrestling.
Bellamy, defended his team's tackles, and said that they only focus on the "contact" was tackled.
Bellamy added that his confidence increased two leading coach's criticism Storm point, because it means that they are afraid of the losing team.
"This will always be speech - I do not have heard Trent Robinson's wrestling speaking, when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee we have not changed any defenses or techniques throughout the year. Over the past six weeks, we have only emphasized the contact tackles, and it has led us to succeed.
Trent has been in the team for three years, and he is obviously a great team coachee, so he is probably not accustomed to lose, and this was therefore a small shock to him.
It's funny how that always comes up this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "the exciting rugby" reminding mentoriaan that Bennett to coach the St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "dull fashion".
Wayne talks about the exciting rugby.
He considered it important to compare his game Saturday night for our Friday night peliimme and tell you how exciting their game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George often criticized the fact that it is a boring team, and Wayne said that he could not care less.
But now he has a team that is able to play the kind of rugby, which we think is exciting, especially when she is a young fast friends.
The kind of game you want to play when you have the types of players.
He brought it to the side in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team have guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play as.
I will be more confident when they say such things because they are a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably did not think of us for resistance to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between the Storm and the Roosters had a point richer than the match between the Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos game was certainly a good game, I have not watched it yet, but how it ended? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more, but if it's exciting rugby?
Or does it an infringement and an exciting goal, the defense of a failure?
For me, this is about policies.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm has this weekend free because they have already won a home game right either North Queensland Cowboys or Sharkseja against Cronulla next Saturday night esifinaaliin AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that the team mates must support the injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb draws
Wenger has also stressed Wilshire, that it is only in September, and assuming that she rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he should not be by Christmas while playing.
In this case, the best Wilshire is missed at least four of the next England game, and taking into account his background, it is uncertain whether he will take part in next summer's European Championship.
The biggest shame in this most recent problem is that the rest Wilshere last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the start of the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten careers," Wenger said.
It is bone that has not improved properly.
It is nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It is not related to his ankles or previous injuries, he has been.
This may be true in medical point of view, but, as Wenger admitted the player tries to come back, there is always the risk between the additional injuries.
Becoming a model is also uncomfortable.
Injuries premier Ltd, studies show that Wilshere has 23 different injuries after he made its debut six years ago.
In addition, he has in the past five seasons, Arsenal have played 157 league game just 65 games.
When viewing a broader package of Arsenal after the 2007-08 season, with six of the eight season it has been one of the two Premier League teams who have lost the most days of injury.
Wenger admits a vicious circle chance, but Arsenal believes that their last season in repentance injury statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when you return to the disability may be prone season, when the need to strengthen the body and to acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I am sure that it will happen, and that he may be made a career as worthy.
Wenger is preparing to recycle their team, when Arsenal start their games in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb after playing Chelsea'a on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be started.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Nacho Monreal's Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott to replace.
"I try to maintain a balance and give respite to those looking for the players," Wenger said.
While Arsenal is the F-block further clear favorite, Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is Europe's scary.
Dinamo is also not lost 41 match after they produced their own "invincible" campaign last season.
Shook the stadium Tuesday night, an earthquake, a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned from last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco, and still motivates him to a distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This is a huge motivation," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never reached it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy, which taught us the serious issues of friendship between the two men
It is striking how similar the descriptions do not have classes, especially in view of the fact that men need to open up is more desperate than ever, and the young men in suicide rates higher than fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death among 20-45-year-olds in men in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
The company grasp the problem Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the 2015 men for the year. The aim was to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of meeting this challenge.
involved in a recent study of more than 2,000 yläkoulu- and high school age students who showed symptoms of depression. The survey found that person the opportunity to recover doubled if a high enough prosenttiosa of his friends had "a healthy mind".
Similarly, those who were not depressed, any mental health problems, the probability of the occurrence was cut in half, if they were mentally healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must first be available.
through this social media communication style time goes by and the content of the answers to the immediacy is often more important than the relevance of contact.
Digital life have doubled the need appears strong, happy and successful, even though in reality dominated by isolation.
This superficial success is dominated by values which psychologists call extrinsic: money, image, social status. All of this takes place in internal values - personal growth and friendship inner longing - at the expense of affecting the deeper mental health.
And, as a billionaire video game developer explained recently, money really does not get more happiness.
Friends' fineness was just in the fact that it turned the focus of its head.
None of the characters is not specified in their work, but rather on their personalities that stood out clearly to interact with friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs while watching football, Ross miss Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can identify with all of this, even though they are often hesitant to fully explore their feelings.
As a volunteer Samaritans organization explained to me: ... "I listened to people who are depressed and suicidal, I really understood how the slightest interaction with a friend can improve survival."
Often, let us take the men feel they can not talk to friends.
The old adage "getting over" is strong, as well as the feeling that if the open issues, is seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to provide more long-term survival.
It highlighted the friendship between the men's little moments.
Even though impartial, outside my position at one end of the phone helps people to despair at times, long-term support comes from the nearby, a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you participate in Comedy Central's FriendsFestiin this weekend, and all of the locations are planned to celebrate the occasion again, why do not you would take your friends for a coffee Central Perkiin.
Or, better yet, if you see a Starbucks on lonely, smile and say hello.
You can never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends sent Comedy Central has from beginning to end, all 236 episodes, to participate in # FriendsFest'iin
