Teacher admits to fatally shooting his girlfriend during an emergency call
The sound just a little bit of shuddering University teacher Shannon Lamb says during an emergency call to the police that he shot his girlfriend and that police officers should enter their apartment.
Lamb stressed that his "Golden dogs" of being alive and would probably be shocked, as well as close family members of the deceased woman said, contact information can be found on this phone.
Inside the House police found Amy Prentissin of the body and a handwritten message, reproduced at page: "I am so very sorry I wish I could undo that I loved the Amya, and she is the only woman who has ever loved me," said the letter, which according to experts, there is a tennis court and signed by.
Nothing pointed out that Lamb, who taught two courses, the Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 miles to the school campus, where the police officer believes his teacher of the history of the ampuneen and killed, Ethan Schmidt, the Office door.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford told University officials heard shooting at 10.18.
He said, you know, a tennis court and a dramatic emergency call for some time after that.
The number of deaths rose by the end of the day still one: Lamb piirittäessä äntä committed suicide to the police.
Still, the authorities tried to figure out the motive, a tennis court and a day after the students and staff had been holed up in the school shooting due to the locked doors.
Scientists on both sides of the State have published information to the effect that the students and staff to become a teacher, which, however, described the Lambia, or talented, possibly had problems.
Students told to have shown some maturity in his hours.
Prentissin kuolinpaikkakunnan, Gautierin, Lambilla, that was not violent, the police said in the past, or a criminal record.
Schmidt himself was included in the book which he wrote to a tennis court, where he paid tribute to the "great people", with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught social sciences and the history of the institution, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students took part in the training courses of the two men.
On the other hand, were some of the signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lambia, but said that he was also nervous and less alarming, "as if something had been wrong".
Another student, a tennis court and told him that Mr Sykes said he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave in Delta State Universitysta, saying that he had some sort of health problem.
This year, he taught two courses.
Recent changes in the University's remuneration principles meant that, even if the Lamb had been working hard to complete his doctorate, in front of, it does not taannutkaan him an automatic career development and an Assistant Professor in the posts.
The Rector of the University of William Lamb and Schmidt LaForge somewhat breathlessly describes how said there was no contradiction between his predicament, but that "clearly a tennis court and a sense there was something".
These are the questions the Lamb will no longer be able to respond to.
After Lamb had fled the campus, police reached his jäljilleen when he moved back to Mississippi Arkansas State.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a pistol a House 38-kaliiperisella. backyard about one and a half miles south of her parents ' House in a suburb of Greenville, Mississippi told the Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
A tennis court and a car was still running in the garden on the road.
Was not immediately clear why the Lamb went to this House, although Johnson said she believed that the Lamb felt the people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and educational science. The University has 3500 students and it is located in the city, which has about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb earned a Ph.d. in educational science in the spring.
One of the tennis court and the old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic performer ", and fun.
Carl Hairston has been told that the 15-year-old and the Lamb with a 20-year-old, when they met through common friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and the Lamb was fun, the older guy, who tried for many years to teach Hairstonia to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer at the time.
All the girls were to melt the wax, when he was in attendance, told the now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in a suburb of Jackson up in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been together for some time.
In an emergency call he had killed his wife, but their Lamb told her marriage does not have any evidence.
They had a Lightning-a dog who lived with them in the brick house to the banks of the river Gautierissa.
Police told the dog to be in order.
Prentissin ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told their divorced 15 years ago, but have remained friends. They now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He is really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me that they had met with the Abigaililta Lambia, but had heard about his daughter, the Lamb was interested in music and played the Blues.
Lamb met with Prentissin, when the Lamb and Abigail were both performing at the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together with the jokusilla.
O'Steen told me that his daughter is doing and singing his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a variety of online businesses.
Gautierin twilight of the father's bar, located near The Julep Room bartender and occasional entertainment organiser Mike Shaffer says he saw a Lamb and Prentissin last September 5. night, when Lamb was finished guitar and harmonica performances harvalukuiselle the public.
Nothing appeared to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
Pelleilimme and heittelimme sutkauksia to each other.
They were both quite clever.
In the first year, the students of the teacher killed Schmidt led the seminar program and was a specialist in the history of the colonial period, Indians and told the school's English teacher, Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Kansas Emporia State University, as well as his sister and had a student Government Office.
Tuesday night in Cleveland, Ohio on the campus of Delta State was held a candlelight prayer, which was attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the mass, during which the University Choir sang in the Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the opiskelijoitamme to return to the" LaForge somewhat breathlessly describes how said.
The crisis is over.
It is now in the recovery process.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported to Mississippi in Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus, the Mississippi of Greenville, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans took part in the report.
The story has been corrected it, that, you know, a tennis court and an emergency call the police now say Schmidt's firing, and that even though the Lamb, I referred to the Prentissiin vaimonaan during a call, there is no evidence that they had been married.

The United Nations says that the situation in Syria to solve the arms

8, support for the poll results that show that Donald Trump is serious about
Some have tried to brand him to wind up for a.
Others consider him only as a joke.
Part of the wait for the meltdown.
While some Republicans have tried to haul away the support for the top position among the surveys Donald Trumpia, it is not (yet).
The last 11 national survey ten Donald Trump has been the head of dates with two-digit century, and some are beginning to seriously think about what this means for the real estate of the King's name as far as possible.
The election season is, of course, only in the early stages.
These results do not mean that Trumpista is likely to be the Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that, at this stage, in 2011, Rick Perry was losing its leadership to Herman Cainille, neither of which received the support of any of the States of the nomination process.
There are also a number of reasons why to him would be a problem in the general election.
The outside groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and conservative economic organization Club for Growth, have, however, taken note of Trump's persistence and beginning to use resources to topple him.
Following the recent support for the survey results point to the fact that the real estate King is not just a passing phase:
Trump's suosittuusluvut have done an about-turn.
Just before when Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's support in the polls showed that only two out of ten republikaania welcomed the real estate King.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, six out of ten republikaanista is Donald Trumpiin.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative view.
These figures are also valid for the first esivaaliosavaltioissa.
Quinnipiacin support for the poll in Iowa last week, the University's doing 60% of republikaaneista told us that they are in favour of Trumpiin.
Two-thirds of the republikaaniäänestäjistä would be satisfied if the Trumpista should be the candidate.
A CNN poll last week, 67%/ORC:n republikaaneista said that they would either "enthusiastic" or "pleased" If Trump would be a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "shocked" if he would be a candidate.
But Ben Carson may be a more or less the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% of the "passionate" vs. Trump's 40%).
Next, the most enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of the republikaaniäänestäjistä would be "unhappy" or "shocked", if those in power should the candidate Jeb Bush's favourite.
Trump's fiery temperament is not a problem for the vast majority of republikaaneista.
Even though Donald Trumpia has been criticised widely for his pompous speeches and loukkauksistaan, Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of the Republican side of the rising of the voters at the national level is the President of the real estate King who thinks that the appropriate temperament.
Quinnipiacin, according to the first survey last week in the case of the Party Congress in the State of Iowa chapter is the same: 52% of the republikaaneista thinks that the Director of the Trumpilla is appropriate to the nature of the quality.
The ABC/Post poll, 44 percent, however, thinks that his character suitable for the President to act, and nearly six out of ten are of the opinion that his character outside the White House.
Republikaaniäänestäjät is struggling with the idea.
When republikaaniäänestäjät think like the commentators, they are of the opinion that the Trump is a real option.
CNN/ORC:n, according to the survey, four out of ten liked Trumpia as an alternative when asked who will most likely be nominated the Republican candidate.
Yet at the end of July, four out of 10 supported Jeb Bush.
Data release: the Republican party voters is not always have access to the brightest possible crystal ball.
In the last parliamentary term, this time four of the ten republikaanista was of the opinion that Rick Perry is to be appointed as a candidate, and only 28% in favour of the final candidate, Mitt Romneyta.
In any case, this shows that the majority of the Republican party to voters to keep Trump's campaign credibility.
Even if the Republicans would be to support the second, Finland, Trump would still be almost every.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to the support of the management, because Trump's against Trump's is divided into a great number of other graduate.
Monmouth University at the beginning of September, however, the survey showed that the bilateral-assuming the race with my father and almost all the other Republican graduate, Trump will get a majority in almost all cases.
He leads the Carly Fiorinaa 13 points, Marco Rubiota 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 jets, as well as Rand Paul, John Kasichia and Chris Christietä for every 33 points.
He is the points Ted Cruz.
The only Trump's winning candidate?
If they were set to edge Ben Carson would win the business with my father on the large 18 point margin.
Just barely a majority of Donald Trump's supporters have been told they have made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT:n query tiistailta indicates that only a little more than half of Trumpia voter has decided whom their voice goes.
The situation could, of course, subject to change, and no one can be completely sure to say that he never would change his mind.
46% reported that they could potentially change, Finland.
In any case, Trump's biggest rival at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters, who said they have made a decision, are two times more likely to have Trump's side.
Six out of ten republikaanista says, that are in agreement with Trump's immigration.
Since then, when Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "raiskaajiksi" campaign launch speech, immigration has been at the center of the debate in the year 2016.
Some are concerned about the fact that Trump's heroics do latinoäänestäjiä away from the Republican party, and damage to the uudelleenbrändäysyrityksiä.
On Monday, the new ABC/Post poll according to the survey, six out of ten agree with Trump's republikaanista says it is immigration.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of the issues, so too is the Donald Trump.
The frustration of the Government has increased to reached a new peak.
Donald Trump's and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of the republikaaniäänestäjistä, due to a large extent their status outside of politics.
Six out of ten republikaanista said Monday on the ABC/Post poll, that they prefer an outside person, other than a policy, which is the Government experience.
They are also angry at the Federal Government.
Two weeks behind the Des Moines Register/Iowa is admitted as the Bloomberg survey showed that three of the four republikaanista of Iowa is frustrated with the republikaaneihin in Congress: 54% are "unhappy" and 21 percent "really angry".
Jeremy Corbynin first appeared in the Prime Minister's question time
Corbynin, our question time has been eagerly awaiting her election from the
The leader of the labour party's new labour-Jeremy Corbyn faces David Cameron's for the first time in the Prime Minister's question time.
CORBYN will rise to ask for the first of the six question a little after noon, and most likely, as well as media that Labour MPs are keeping closely at her performance.
CORBYN has called for this weekly show "less and more facts".
He has also said, that could leave part of the events of his colleagues.
This encounter will be the first parliamentary try Corbynin to leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government, and he spoke at the annual meeting of the Central Organization of trade unions on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labor Party leader's decision to stand for the national anthem during the Tuesday Memorial jumalanpalveluksessa quietly, which took place at the battle of Britain air war, 75. on the anniversary, has given rise to criticism on the members of the conservative party, and appeared in several front page stories.
Corbynin the decision to resist national anthem has attracted the attention of the
Corbynin said his "stagnant with respect to quietly" and that he recognizes "the bravery of the British Royal Air Force aircraft in the war."
Corbynin shadow of the Member of the Board of Directors, Owen Smith, said the BBC Newsnight programme, Twon that he should be called on the leader of the Labour Party, to sing the national anthem, despite the fact that, in his opinion, the King of the room should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen Shadow Minister has refused to be involved in the economic circles in the Corbynin, citing the controversy, defence and Foreign Affairs. Initially not more than one-sixth of the leader of the party, and he was supported by Parliament.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that the alignment of the differences regarding the role of the European Union, as well as the assistance of the Government of the party the roof are "built up" within the Labour Party, after the appointment of the Corbynin.
CORBYN said at a meeting of the Organization of professional associations, the workers ' party to amend, which would eliminate the entire roof.
Hours later, the Shadow Secretary for work and pensions the Government, Smith said, that the party was "very clear" that they only oppose the Government's plans to calculate the ceiling in the range of 23 to 26 000 0000 against the pound.
Corbynista will be the fifth head of the Labour Party, which David Cameron has faced over the past decade, during which he has been the leader of the conservative party.
The leader of the labour party has promised a new kind of approach to politics, and now says that he is a "joukkoistanut" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister, and received more than 30 000.
Islington North-the area Member of Parliament, Corbyn has said that the Prime Minister's question time the character is too in opposition to arranging and that he plans to abstain from, as well as clever piece of sanailusta that piikittelystä, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, as well as the challenges of young people.
CORBYN has said, that the shadow government's economic Secretary Angela Eagle him question if Corbyn will not participate in the-for example, when Cameron is in a foreign country.
CORBYN is also suggested by the fact that the other members would sometimes give to speak, and he is the President of the House of Commons, said lähestyneensä John Bercowia, on this issue.
When Cameron rose to the leadership of 2005, he said, that wants to move away from the sort of political theatre, which is often associated with the Prime Minister's question time to hours, but he was later to admit they have failed.
Since then, when they began to be filmed in 1990, the Prime Minister's question time has been an important measure of the assessment of the Director's discretion, his control of the House of Commons, as well as his position on the other members, although critics have criticised the poll for hours about it, that they have become only a caricature, which calls for far-reaching reforms.

Metcash is trying to protect IGA-from the South and he was issued a Aldin in Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grass-roots campaign in defence of the IGA-traders in the market share of South and Western Australia before Aldin 700 million dollars.
Aldi is preparing for the opening of the first of the two distribution centers as well as the trade early next year in the South and Western Australia, which is coming up in 120 shops. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen its relations with local food brokers and are building the IGA brand power to power-and social media marketing, as well as events such as the Adelaide show-exhibition.
IGA:n traders and contractors have jumped, and brands such as Dunsborough'sta, the future ice-cream manufacturer Simmo's offer a taste of IGA:n stores, and shop owners selling discounted tickets to Australian rules football matches in the loyalty of its customers.
Metcashin is expected to uncover more details of the defense strategy 29. September, when this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler will hold its annual investors ' strategy of the day.
The game is a lot of, as the South and Western Australia make up a total of nearly 30% of the Metcashin IGA-shopping area, and the profit margins are higher than in the eastern Länder Metcashin IGA-network.
The southern and Western Australian shoppers are known to be a clique, and they have a much larger IGA:n retailers market share as New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the South and the West, as compared to the Eastern States by 24% to 14%.
Analysts, however, believe that, as Morgan Stanley Aldi grabs approximately 5% of the food market of the two State within 12 months of the opening of the first movement. Turnover is all operators, but mainly from independent retailers.

This forecast is based on the assumption that the Aldi opens next year in the South and to the West by 25 to 30 movement, which produce 500 and 600 million dollars in turnover in these areas.
The quantities of food and food sales and the loss of the Metcashin of the high fixed-cost base can be paid Metcashille about $ 13 million loss before interest and taxes EBIT, Kierath said.
At the same time, the share of the market is mainly in the eastern Länder, Metcash lose Aldille and Colesille, even though a recent Roy Morgan's study, it was found that IGA:n's customers were all faithful.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashin food and food sales to drop 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and the 2.1% of GDP in 2018, so that its market share of the year 2015 14% to 10.3% in 2020.

The Australian tennis Association President Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakisia
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves rather glory as the criticism of the conduct of
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered from the recent sivullisena in the storm, which has been raging for his friend Nick Kyrgioksen. He deserves credit for his own conduct, rather than criticism of the notes for the Australian tennis Association President Steve Healy.
"Special See ', the talented duo in a junior member on the case of Kokkinakis had inadvertently made public, with the Montreal Masters Kyrgios irritated by Stan Wawrinkaa.
Soon after this, in the qualifier in Cincinnati, the head judge was forced twice to distinguish between Kokkinakisin and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared: "Wawrinkan would have had to hack Kyrgios, and should I hack brings a kid."
Even though the last was seen tearing down the Kokkinakis mail after a cramp ruined his possible victory by Richard Gasquetista US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of the Kokkinakisin.
Right now, the LAD is in Glasgow, competing with the Sam Grothin from another location for heads-up play with the Davis Cup semifinal against the United Kingdom by Bernard Tomicin.
"I'm pretty strongly of the view that, according to rähinään is only drawn Thanasi", Healy said.
He broke in the mail because of its hävitessään to do in-depth research of the U.S. Open, but he is not the first player who breaks his turhautuessaan Thanasin in the mail, and I know well enough to know that he is not proud of.
But he has behaved extremely well, but also quite a provosoivissa situations in the US open, Harrison, and so on, and I think he deserves the compliments.
He has a great team around him, he is a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little more harshly.
He is a very mature 19-years old, she works hard, is, according to the team, and so on, and he has never had problems with other players. He is appreciated in the locker room, he practices hard, is in good condition and is very calm and mature young man, and I think that he should be judged on their merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take the important games on Friday, according to the State of Kyrgiosta to aid applications relating to this as a "joint decision" all in favor of a solution, but aid still canberralaisen the return of the team's vakikalustoon.
"We want the team to be completely focused on the game and not all the polemiikkiin [Kyrgiosin] around," Healy said.
And Nick has risen very fast, as for example, Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he aikuistuu to the public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the a sense marks. We, however, we will try to support him, we will try to help him understand the consequences of their actions, and I think that is the best of both teams that for him, if he spends some time out of the public eye in serious consideration of these consequences.
Hungary declared a State of emergency in the European maahanmuuttokriisi:, close the borders to arrest immigrants
Hungary declared a State of emergency and closed the Serbian player in the southern limit to those who tried to enter the country illegally. The aim is to padota immigrants.
The frontier was followed by chaos, with hundreds of settlers gathered around a neutral area, and the Serbian authorities will react to the tyrmistyksellä.
People who fled the violence in their own countries, have now put up their tents and settled in for an indefinite block of the road between the two control stations.
Frustration, however, increased.
The police helicopter, fuelled by above them immigrants lived during the "Open border!" and shouting insults, the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister, declared that it is "impossible to accept" the return of immigrants from Hungary, when more and more of them will arrive in Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause harm to civilians.
The debate must take place in the next few days in other countries and with Brussels, "Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Mayhem at the border between Hungary and Serbia was born after 28 failed to create a common immigration policy, the nationality of a group of riitaisassa at a meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed on the Division of responsibilities in the case of an applicant for asylum, 40 000 people, who now have taken over the Italian and Greek. The Ministers spoke of hopes for a final agreement-in the next month or by the end of next year, the EU countries will take 120 000 more refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday next week and Austria calling for extra EU Summit to discuss the continent's maahanmuuttokriisistä.
Hungary does not hope that its neighbors or to Brussels to work in the near future.
On Tuesday, a State of emergency in two southern region gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and made it possible that you could be shut down and the right of asylum of the stuff can be speeded up.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that now that the fence on the border with Serbia is ready, the country also plans to erect a barbed wire-fence for the border against Romania in an effort to halt the flood of migrants into the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even prisoners were being sent to complete the barbed-wire fence, according to the Hungarian and Serbian.
In the last few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and place of arrival in the European Union, many of whom are refugees from the war in exile in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, argues that the majority of the influx of economic refugees looking for a better life, and war refugees, who are eligible for protection under the-this view is very much in conflict with the other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, is now a criminal offence defined by the company exceeds or damage the 4-metre (13 foot) barbed-wire fence, which the Government has built against the southern boundary in Serbia, as well as include longer prison sentences for traffickers.

We are in fact very clear: illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Parliament must still be formally approved next week, the expected military positioning, but Associated Press reporters at the border are seen for days now, the heavily armed military personnel ajoneuvoineen and with their dogs.
Orban, Gyorgy Palfi's domestic security adviser, said that the authorities were Bakondi caught up 45 people when they try to cross the border, as well as beyond the country to celebrate the 15 already.
They got over to the detriment of the fence, are now in the police vangitsemina, and they are charged with violations of the new law defined.
The authorities fix the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed on Tuesday morning, two of the seven crossing points on the borders separating another territory of Serbia after they were sent to the barbed wire of the trailer to close one of these places the emotional toll of the train.
Päärajan crossing, close to the Hungarian Roszkea was covered in chaos, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for the handling of people and crowds of thoughtless stick inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands of people were left on the outside of the box.

the 2016 election, according to the national survey of Hillary Clinton's lead is narrowing of the Bernie Sandersiin
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue a two-digit designation of the head of the Democrats in the race, but Senator Bernie Sanders WINS to catch him.
Clinton 47% of Democrats, the voters are now supported (58% decline), and the second the Youth supports 27% (increased by 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced if he will, according to the President of the race, but he's worth 15% of the Democrats in the electorate.
More than five months before the start of the primary elections, the majority of the demokraattiäänestäjistä notes that it is still too early to say that they had decided who to vote for.
Clinton's supporters are standing on their own choice on the back, however, in a more restrictive way than other graduate supporters.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among the various population groups, last month's CBS News Poll-survey, and at the same time, Sanders has risen to some degree.
Clinton is a strong leader on the women and moderates, but his leadership has been narrowed.
His popularity among men has decreased significantly, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead in less than 50 years of demokraattiäänestäjien has disappeared, and he is now tied with Sanders.
Clinton, however, leads to a clearly older voters.
Last month, Clinton led during the Liberal Youth tuplanumeroisella, but now Sanders to lead this group of five percentage points.
About half of the country's demokraattiäänestäjistä says that they support Clinton, if he becomes the party's nominee.
A quarter said their support for him, subject to certain reservations, and 15 percent would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent did not support him at all.
It is hardly surprising that Clinton's current sponsors are very likely to be eager in his tukemisessaan.
Most are sekavampia those that do not currently support Clinton-just a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
48% of Democrats in the electorate says that they support Clinton, the Republican's number one man, Donald Trumpista the same republikaaniäänestäjä (35%) say fewer people.
When asked about the issue of the Clinton fans who wanted to open why they wanted him as a candidate for, the most popular response was, that he or she has the appropriate experience (16%). After this, the most popular answers were, that now is the right time for a female President (13%), and that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his link to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same views as well as the possibility to be elected was also mentioned.
As Vice President of the impact of a potential President, 57 percent of the demokraattiäänestäjistä would like to see him already in the competition-although one-third of it is of a different opinion.
When asked about the demokraattiäänestäjiltä who they would choose the second party's name, Biden is the most popular choice.
Clinton's supporters among the more than half said that they would choose Biden, who is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to seek the candidacy of Democrats, Hilary Clinton's management Sandersista to grow. If Biden goes, cable is 20 percentage points, but if he has not signed up to off, the number is 30.
55% of demokraattiäänestäjistä is of the opinion that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure is, however, dropped by 78% in the last month.
This measure falls far short, but their share of Biden, who like her äänestettävimpänä, is grown.
When demokraattiäänestäjiltä was asked, what is the most important thing they value, however, they raised their opinions of äänestettävyyden.
Also last month, one Democrat, Finland, Finland was not considered impossible or possible candidate for these voters.
Democrats candidates or potential candidates do well in certain key areas the party among the electorate.
For the most part to keep Clinton honest, reliable, Youth as well as the Bidenia and strong leaders.
Biden is doing the three best honesty, while Clinton's strength of leadership.
30% of the demokraattiäänestäjistä says, that keep Clinton honest and trustworthy, which is two times more than the Sandersista (15%), but 27 percent said that they have no opinion on the Sandersista.
Demokraattiäänestäjät also, in General, believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically agree.
When you look at all these issues, about a quarter of the demokraattiäänestäjistä says that they have no opinion on the Sandersista.
Even if Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and access to the server when he was Foreign Minister raises more questions, for the most part demokraattiäänestäjistä is happy with his selitykseensä and says that it affected their yleismielipiteeseensä about him.
The case is different, however, when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his selitykseensä, and only about one-third of is satisfied.
People's opinions were in March, shortly after the case came to light.
The majority of Americans says that e-mail controversy affected their 36 percent, even though Clinton becomes the kokonaismielipiteeseensä says that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten republikaanista says, that their opinions have changed since Clinton becomes worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him as an honest and reliable, this is still a problem with all registered to him among voters. Only 32 percent of the regarded him as an honest and reliable, and this figure has dropped 8 percentage points since the last, as well as 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters said that keep Clinton honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of the country's registered voters do not like Trumpia as an honest and reliable.
And Clinton, however, is considered to be good leaders that Trumpia.
Of the six study is accompanied by a kandidaatista Bidenia, rehellisimpinä, and Bush is considered the Carsonia.
As a general rule, considered as an honest, but many youth do not have an opinion of him, just as it is not Carsonistakaan.
The margin of error in the study, with the participation of 351 demokraattiäänestäjää, is 6 percentage points.

Five of the Brotherhood Members accused of Baruch College's first-year student's death
Nearly two years after a student died of humiliation of the brotherhood ceremony at the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains area, the murder charge has been brought against five people.

This happens, when the us Central Bank to raise interest rates
Raising interest rates will be rising rates, and the markets are falling, bond yields will rise and the economy is going into recession.
This we know.
What we don't know is how long this all will go or how long it will take.
The past does little to give assistance in relation to the timing of what comes with that.
The recession has lasted only 11 months after lifting the first sometimes, sometimes has gone as long as 86 months.
The u.s. Central Bank's interest rates, the aggressiveness of the lifting has been often, though not always, the determining factor in how the economy and the financial resources to respond.
That is why the u.s. Central Bank officials are so vigorously insisted that investors should not focus on that, because the interest rates will be increased, but mainly for the normalisation of the situation in the development of the time loop.
The equation is, indeed, a number of variables.
In the end, however, market participants are able to see that all the hössötys has been an oversized lifting interest rates.
"After the global economic crisis, the Central Bank, the first increase will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as ' cheap money ' era of Osnabrück," said Capital Economics, Julian Jessop of global affairs, päätalous expert in the message to your customers.
Instead, we do not expect that the gradual return to normal interest rate levels in the United States, although still low, level is the kind of revolutionary shock, which many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean, however, that it would have consequences.
Below is an overview of how some of the economy-on the basis of the previous development will respond:
As the market has seen in the last months of the year, waiting for the increase, can make the situation unstable.
When the increase will be a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that the capital income has a tendency to stop in 12-24 months after the first increase, which in turn possibly reflects the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study about what happens after the increase in the Central Bank.
To be more precise, the last about 35 years, the market tend to be strong, about a 14 percent rise when approached, 250 days after the situation is fairly flat (the average rise of 2.6%), and the normal mode has been reached 500 days after the last cycle of the average yield of six 14.4%, multiplied by the Nuveen Asset Management company, in a recent analysis of the leading capital one view Bob Doll, which was published in Barron's magazine.
Deutsche Bank shares, according to the impact of the increase in the later stage of the cycle is generally clearer, when revenues start to fall.
Regressions are a part of economic life, but the interest rate of withdrawals often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the Central Bank is faced with certain challenges, which previously did not, and that may accelerate the decline.
This is, in particular, the gross domestic product, which is going to be the closest to the lowest levels ever ahead of the Central Bank's interest rate increase.
According to the Deutsche Bank in the 1950s after the nominal annual GDP is only 118 lifting twice not less than 4.5%.
While the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few believing it standing, after the third quarter has progressed to 1.5%, says the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta.
Lower interest rates lift this fragile economic context can be a risky business and raises the question of "is this time different," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants are prepared for an increase in the Central Bank throughout the year, and all are waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee-the Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and financial experts believe that the Committee can accept a raise at that meeting, the futures market anticipates only a probability of 25%.
"Our research shows that since 1950, all increase the cycles are so far appeared to increase leveraging supersykleissä, with the decline of the GDP has surpassed the previous peak very quickly after a recovery has started," the report says.
On the other hand, the current has been exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst period of observation.
Nykysyklissä, the Central Bank has been waiting for the end of the last recession, by far the longest: the record has been in 35 months, and now there is already a 74. in a month or so.
Fixed income has also been unstable, with the market while waiting for the interest rate increase, and a model of the capital.
The main difference is that the Central Bank changes its line, its effects can be seen in the books as the shares of debt more quickly.
Bond yields shows the first increase/change in the case of the operation of the cycle immediately.
At the end of the cycle, the increase in bond yields will fall immediately, "Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab-strategists believe that the lifting of interest rates will cause a longer-and the convergence of income by lyhyempiaikaisten bonds evenly level post-meal yield curve.
Korkeatuottoiset bonds often produce better in such a situation, even though "we are still wary of the return in terms of searching," said Schwab fixed-yield analyst Kathy Jones in a recent analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market is already adapted to the expectations of the Central Bank's policy.
"The strength of the dollar, and inflation expectations, in addition there are several signs that the market is adapted to a more restrictive monetary policy Outlook," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have increased and the volatility has increased-all of these are specific to the market, where the Central Bank has tightened up the line.
In General, companies whose business is set in mainly the us, win, when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies, which have a lot of debt, perform less well when the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and the debt will be more expensive than what they are funding.
"History shows that ' high-quality ' stocks in general are more lucrative than the first increase in three months," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Companies with strong sales, passed by the weak sales companies in 1994, 1999 and 2004, the average of five percentage points.
Companies with a high return on investment and low volatility stocks, performed better than the matalampilaatuiset companies. First, the average was 4 (percentage points), and with regard to the 3 (percentage points).
The debt will be a big problem.
The companies, which have a large number of floating rate debt, are losing the most, Goldman said.
The stock market speculation on the outside as the consumer has the opportunity to benefit from the increase in the value of the dollar.
Also with the higher income for savers to make a profit, although experts are divided about how quickly the effect feels like.
BBC Radio is a replica of the Classic FM:stä, Member of Parliament, Andrew Bingham says

"In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and to sign up for new works," he said.
Earlier this year the BBC Radio 3 's Manager, Alan Davey, argued that the Canal will have to do more work than in the past to reach the public, because the British people know less about the world of classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only part of the supply of the BBC, which was criticized from the commercial competitors on the toes of the culture, media and urheiluerityisvaliokunnan during the hearing.
The conservative Tory party mp Damien Collins criticized The Voice, music competition, in which the BBC was bought by the Dutch production company Talpa media, according to the estimates of £ 22 million.
Do you understand why this program is discussed often, because it is not the original and is not in any way unique?

He added that he wants the production company "to find success in your House from the inside," the next time, when it launched the entertainment series.
He did not, however, agreed to stop production of The Voice of the future periods, or to order it, that would be used for license payers money to other entertainment formats.

Also, the ownership of the Royal decision of the accused that it used up-to-date means of protection, and it worked with the weatherman.
Mecca suurmoskeijan is surrounded by dozens of cranes, which are part of a huge rakennusryötä, which Binladin Group lead.
Binladinin family has had a close relationship with the Saudi ruler's family for decades, and it will lead to major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaeda Osama bin Laden was a rebellious boy, whose family banned during the 1990s.
The crash happened on a windy and rainy weather, just days before the Kingdom of pilgrimage for millions of arriving, which every able Muslim must do at least once in their lives.
The authorities show that of the 158 people are still in hospital.
Authorities ordered a million rials (£ 174, 000) to pay for the dead, and with the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of that amount.
B&Q-the boss says that Eastern Europeans are working in the back of the popularity of the cheap
The British people are increasingly using the services of apumiesten, Veronique Laury, says
In Eastern Europe the rise of future professional men on the back
As a result of the trade for Screwfix-shops will open 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q-stores around the country
The author Rupert Steiner, on a regular correspondent for the Daily Mail magazine
The British are said to have forfeited their hammers and maalipensseleistään and are rather adept at Eastern European laborers to do home renovations
It seems that if you are handy with a hammer, or in square to paint the walls, you are now in the minority.
The British see the hiring more and more apumiehiä to deal with do-it-yourself work in their homes, says the company's boss in the rear (B) Q &.
Home renovation of the chain of Kingfisherin who owns the new Executive Director Veronique Laury, said that the popularity of the back is from Eastern Europe, which have entered the number of skilled workers and the fact that they offer their services at a ridiculously low price.
This leads to the fact, that due to construction of the Kingfisher is targeted at 200 new Screwfix trade and the closure of 60 B&Q.
Laury, said that he wants more women to work in the B&Q-stores, as eight out of ten in the shop for the purchase decision is specific to the beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the general population must be taken into account: these days, is more one of a woman's House, with more home improvement work as before.
Laury, said: "the majority of the staff of the newly designed garments grace is more and more men.
We must seek a better balance.
Half of our customers, however, is women, and 80% of the product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women have a big role in the decision-making process. "
Laury is one of only five women, leading to Britain's FTSE100 index of the most important companies. He has built up a management team in such a way that it is as much a male and female managers.
The Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group, which is exactly 50% of the women, including the Executive Director and financial director.
Laury, said: "this was a conscious decision-the difference is here very important.
It has not been difficult to find good women. "
Kingfisher reported a decline in sales, as well as half-year earnings that, after the Group took the blame for the closure of the stores.
As a result of the trend Screwfix and B&Q stores the owning Kingfisher is to open 200 new stores
Of the three the ACE Board of Directors decided to resort to the law to save the country's economy a pressing need.
Visible effects were pretty quickly.
The SAK poll, and other wage earner organisations sharp heads began to force the same way and as a result the country is standing on Friday because of a large gathering of workers.
The time considered by many at the time standing on the reason.
Asked whether or not to strike, while anyway goes bad.
It is up to the set up of the resistance liikekin.
On the Internet with over 50 000 people have already been notified that it will not participate in scale but goes to work.
In the good old days it would have been impossible to achieve such a consensus.
Of course, there was no Web, where the protest, but openly rikkuriksi's initiative would have been a small man's political suicide.
A member of such trade union organizations 1 million a few ten thousand people protest not much sway, but think about it gives.
The role of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as of yet some twenty years ago.
All are not familiar with the objectives of the movement, the values are changed
The attractiveness of the point of operation of the trade union movement in the Government's violent solutions can also be seen as a gift from Heaven directly.
When things have for years been rolling under its own weight, so now we finally get to the point, i.e. the employee's rights in alliances to defend, in a visible and properly.
The Government can in this way will the role of the trade union movement in the country, perhaps stronger, when the membership of a Trade Union is seen as perhaps more necessary.
Are the activities of organizations, so it is nonsense to say that Friday's demonstration somehow block the Finnish.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product (GDP) continues to decline, and unemployment is rising.
All of these things, you'd think mandatory.
The University of Lappeenranta hard savings regimen: 8.5 million savings, the aim of the staff will be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of technology to start saving the Curonian spit, the aim of which is to have a total cost of EUR 8.5 million eliminated.

Massive education and a reduction in funding for research on the interaction of yliopistoomme cuts as well as a company is very important, "says the principal of Anneli Pauli of the University Bulletin.
The impact of the cuts before the summer, contributed to the further reduction in the maltillisemmilta, but now the supplemental funding is seen in the new scale.
Negotiations start next week with confidence men on Tuesday and by the laws of the last six weeks.

Delta State University's shooter left anteeksipyyntöviestin
One introduces his girlfriend to Mississippi on a Monday morning-before shooting colleagues later in the day-is Shannon Lamb wrote in the message, which said he was "sorry" for the first murder and hoped "that could undo it," told authorities on Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautierin police told me that the Delta State University's geography and social sciences teacher at 10 o'clock in the morning, the emergency number for Lamb played around
on Monday, and told me that he has shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant, that the police must be sent to konstaapeleita at his house.
He said "he had killed his wife last night," and also mentioned that the House is "cute dog", which "does not bother anyone," but there are probably shocked.
The police asked the caller for this name, but he was not told about it.
Lamb did not give an explanation for ampumiselle.
When the police reached the scene, found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentissin, as well as a tennis court and a 45-year-old hand-written message, which read: "I'm so sorry I wish I could undo it.
I loved the Amya, and he was the only person who has ever loved me. "
After writing the message to the Lamb drove almost 500 kilometers from the Delta Stateen, where he was killed by a history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killed himself late on Monday, police piirittäessä him.
The Rector of the University of William Lamb and Schmidt LaForge somewhat breathlessly describes how said there was no contradiction between his predicament, but that "clearly a tennis court and a sense there was something".
Officials said on Tuesday that despite the allegations published on Monday, according to which the Lamb would have thought Prentissin was in relation to Schmidtiin, did not have "any information or evidence of" any kind "of a triangle drama".
Shawn was married to O'Steen told the Prentissin for about seven years and described him as "good".
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said that he and Prentissillä was a 19-year-old daughter, who is "shocked".
O'Steen told that Prentiss and her daughter were "simply the best friends".
According to Knowles, Prentiss worked from his home by hand by papito online. The Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of the Prentissin.
Knowles told that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating a tennis court with about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
A tennis court and, you know, the police told relatives at one point Monday to tell them that "he will not go to jail."
When the police reached a tennis court and a Highway 1 near Greenvilleä later that evening, Lamb stopped his car at the side of the road, left it there and started running in the Woods, where the shot himself.
Lamb received his Ph.d. from the educational science of the University of Statesta in the spring of 2015, says Delta's Web site found in the curriculum vitae.
The stars, who lost their charm
Näyttelijällä (left), pictured with his son, people all over the world (on the right), has in recent years been tough.
In 2001, he was suffering from leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to rumors, he has also had a drug problem, and in 2008, he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All this really requires a toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months because of kaksoismurtuman
Luke Shaw got kaksoismurtuman in the right foot in Manchester United's Champions League match when PSV Eindhovenille.
Even though the defender was left in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw would not play again this season.
Injury caused by Héctor Moreno reckless taklaus 15. minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into the PSV:n area.
He treated with 9 minutes on the field and he had to be to provide oxygen prior to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "he has kaksoismurtuma on my feet, and he is now in the hospital."
He will be transferred to tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then cut in Manchester.
This is horrible. The son of Manchester United at the age of 18, suffering from difficulties and after playing brilliantly, and now it happens like this.
When I was in the locker room, he had an oxygen mask on.
She was crying.
I am not a doctor, but kaksoismurtuma will take at least half a year, and he will play in the group stage.
I hope that he gets to play this season.
Moreno was influenced by the onnekkaalta when he got a red card and a penalty shot or a.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli was not punished the Mexican players.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian administration was wrong.
You will be able to judge the situation for themselves, when I say that it came from a penalty shot and the red card.
It was a really bad two-foot taklaus.
Shaw twiittasi as follows: "thank you for all the messages concerning the, words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, while I was convalescing starts now, I'll come back stronger."

English puolustajalla is a further incentive to recover from next June's European Championships in France.
PSV:n coach Phillip Cocu said: "It is really bad for people with disabilities."
If a player is going out with this kind of injury, all are very sad.
The purpose of our players have never injured an opponent.
Moreno's leg broke, when he played for the Mexican national team against the Dutch Van Gaalin the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno to this heavily, because the intention is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it is a bad thing," Cocu said.
I saw in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it seemed like he [Moreno] is to be applied to it, but I saw Luke's taklausta.
Moreno said SBS6:lle: "I know what it feels like, I know how difficult this kind of thing can be.
I feel terrible because of this, I'm so sorry. "
PSV:n Andres Guardado was taken to the hospital by Chris Smallingin haastettua him.
I guess David Cameron feels Loraxin this better?
Every parent learns soon one thing: If your child loves something like the record, does not last long before it learns almost by heart.
Not only, then, if you're David Cameron.
When vacation time child care, the service asked the Prime Minister for his suosikkilastenkirjaansa, he chose The Lorax-Dr. Seussin's book, published in 1971, the environmental performance of the story.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the company's website, SuperCamps, and continues: "Funny, touching, creative, and includes a strong message. I enjoyed when I read this book for my children, because it always seems to find a picture or message, that we have not previously seen. "
All of this is true, but in the next paragraph, where Cameron presumably describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the year 2012 the movie version, with a fairly short paragraphs fill was added to the new characters and details.
"Inside the walls of the Tarvillen in which all of nature has been lost and even the air is a commodity, Ted-son hopes to win over the heart of the girl of her dreams by filling in with Audrey's signature wish to see the right tree", the text says, and describes the love story, which in 1991 killed Dr. Seuss, Theodor Seuss Geisel, real name is written.
If this is still not enough to be suspicious, Cameron's text sounds like in some places as it would be taken from the Internet Movie Database-the Web pages of the Executive summary, the Lorax movie plot that begins with the following: "inside the walls of the Tarvillen in a city where everything is artificial, and even the air is a commodity, Ted-son hopes to win the girl of his dreams Audrey-heart."
Taking into account the fact that Cameron is a publicly active older, it appears unlikely that he would be so unversed in the book storyline. In it a young, nameless boy, how the local nature is destroyed by a greedy, Kerskanen, hakkaava and tarviksia of the trees, regardless of the name of the issuing knitters from the short story, viiksekkäästä from Loraxista, which "speaks on behalf of the trees".
Such a relatively invisible to the PR-the task is probably outsourced to the expert, who did not appear to have ever read the book 20 times in a row.
The Prime Minister's spokesman, said that the text will become Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was Cameron's staff, but did not comment on the matter at the moment.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of falling to the side of the English team, but it was still a hard place
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates have a tough task, but when you see what kind of a team's tour of England has chosen to come back to you, I do not believe that the 3-0 series loss there is a likelihood of a recurrence.
I would called voittoakaan out of the equation.
Alastair Cook's Party may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but it comes with some good kierrelyöjiä and the team's way of thinking is strong: they do not have the scars for the year 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid has evolve thread syötöissään hyökkääjävaihtoehto, even if it is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth fell out of the England cricket team, his place will be Alex Hales
The decision to exclude Adam Lyth team is understandably difficult to analyze for me, because I'm his päävalmentajansa in Yorkshire.
His seven of his game have been good against invaders challenging circumstances, and a simple but the sad truth is that, on the basis of their criticism of the kriketinpelaajia in its results.
Joe the forwarding of choice, for example, there was no uncertainty before release, because, as I have said in the past, the players are the best choice.
About a hundred points more, and Lythin of the season the team would be able to continue, but he was personally responsible for their own destiny.
Hopefully, if he can get more home runs the special, another chance will come to the front.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised the Lythin attitude, even when he has not done quite as well as it could have been, and does not surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question, how long the batteries may be a trail.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected to the yhdeksästi.
But Compton got a chance to play at home and away.
The only complaint is that the English chose Jonathan Trottin first to the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but it's a missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales comes along, and it is the batteries which I appreciate.
He is the one of the kriketinpelaajana, with which we are in Yorkshire, we saw early this season, when he scored 236 points against us at the Trent Bridge pitch.
At the very least, the same facilities as the need to give him the other before him, but this of course depends on the composition of the team of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
At the opening of the Cook's idea of Moeenista space is tossed around, in which case the field to an extra pitcher but that four fast, and I am not against this.
I do not understand why the batter could hit there, and this left handed has already shown itself to be quite a cricketer.
Moeen is not necessarily made by its mission to the country in his Worcestershiressa, but he is giving them a 3 and it is not much of a difference.
The old team mate Justin Langer scored the first 38 of his game when the first lattice, before moving to an opening bid in 2001.
He did as soon as three hundred points and remembered past.
Zafar Ansari will be on the team, it's a bit of a varasyöttäjäksi, and what I have been in contact with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his batting statistics-average fail fully to 31, with the ball 35-and think that it is a gamble, but there is not too much of a syöttäjiä and the voters opted for young people.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
The team outside of England, seems to be a few hard addition valmentajapuolelle.
The appointment of a consultant in the Srilankalaisen the batter's Mahela Jayawardenen games can turn out to be a neronleimaukseksi.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, and brings with it a huge amount of experience, as it is done all in all situations and in all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood will be the white ball games, and brings with it, as well as the energy that the relentless sun deck.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it be gaming or preparation, and he has the same kind of exploits your cleverness than Mahelalla.
Sometimes new sounds in the locker room to refresh teams, even though their message is the same as in the past.
Collyn team friends from Durham, Ben Stokes, lepuutetaan yksipäiväisissä, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have a problem with this.
Even if not everyone agrees with, coaches, and chose not to do.
And you have to remember that, just as the players, their work depends on the outcome.
These kinds of decisions are never made lightly.
Britain's departure from the EU (Brexit) can take a profit, if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-hearted uudelleenneuvottelustrategiat in order to keep the Eu in Britain are facing day by day more and more bigger problems, although not to be taken into account even heartfelt Jeremy "is it yes or no?" The selection of the leadership of the Labour Party, Corbynin or professional associations suuttumisesta for Europe on Tuesday.
Also, many foreigners have their own Corbyninsa and Mr Faragensa.
A European diplomat, the guy explained recently that since the EU is so deep in a variety of crises, all of which are not its own reasons, some Member States are fed up with the British itsekeskeiseen agenda, which is filled with controversy-causing concessions and distracting contract changes that these States are for the most part do not want to.
At the annual meeting in Brighton, Central Organisation of trade unions decided not to even that want them, if they are holding back on social protection.
We could even call it Dave's and George's selfieagendaksi.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of myöhästelevät in the capitals of the holding of bilateral summits or meetings of foreign, take a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, either with or without him, the local silmäätekevän and then come home, saying that the win supporters for reforms.
It is all about me.
European friends, who wants to outward on the inside of the tent, the EU-Britain-"do not leave us alone with the French," Berlin said, suggests that certain capital cities lyhytnäköisimmät Ministers and officials are now at a point that they care about will then we will go.
The German conservative and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years, and wants to leave the action before it gets spoiled by in the same way as it was too long for the viipyneille Thatcher (11 years), Kohl, Mitterrand (14) and (16).
The French François Hollandella is the face of re-election or replacement in 2017.
He, too, is a fading force.
Poland can point to be nationalist, right-wing Government, the Spanish left-wing.
It is difficult to see these countries on behalf of the uhrautumassa selfiebrittien, when their energy would be better off to head to the source of the United Kingdom, that the Scotland-they do not want that either because of the separatist trends similar to their own.
So, my friend put some of these Ministers can even design deliberately pointless comments to do with the Scottish National Party in the style of the British year 2017 during the campaign for the referendum, to speed up the Brexit process.
"Uudelleenneuvottelut was arranged in a thing" and "Uudelleenneuvotteluilla did not have any meaning."
Europeans have had difficult personal experience, how voracious Fleet Street newspapers, the press knows how to be and how the EU-skeptical press yksinvaltiaat are, what they were not inspired by Tony Benn at the time of the 1975 referendum, when in 1973, started our membership was the ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunistin, who made a name for themselves by writing "the bananas in the EU direct payments" when he was a correspondent in Brussels, in the early 90 's.
Ed Miliband was maybe stupid, but at least she knew who her enemies were.
They included a motley crowd of national security, taxes, vierastavia phones hakkeroivia foreigners, as well as persons whose place of residence is in nominal terms elsewhere and who own most of the big newspapers in newspapers.
Tony Blair, in fact, thought of them all as well, but realized that if you are in a cage with a gorilla with the lustful, bananas must be abandoned because of the confusion, unless you do not want to be the gorilla for lunch and another for dinner.
In fact, Miliband was blairilaisempi than Blair himself, what will Cameron's uudelleenneuvottelutempun. Bair was agreed on the principle of the EU behind the rejected Constitution, which French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press is given to him that either never sorry.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me please on the backs of the houses of Parliament on Monday (I told him, that he has no more time to spare for me), would seem to be risked to embrace again boycotted by the 1980s Neil Kinnock Murdoch-strategy, which was a mistake as well as that now.
Although it can take some time, however, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not for me, but there is no doubt that Andrew Marriin, which the BBC couch Corbyn took off on Sunday.
Corbynin official site of Europe is, to put it nicely, the evolving.
He says that would like us to remain in the renewed space in the EU.
Well, the majority of the people of the United Kingdom Independence Party Ukip war paint-intoilun, as well as outside the conservative party hurjimpien nationalists can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-a fan of the" Benn put it this way, as well as on the radio that on tv this week, when his inner partiolaisensa had wanted to admit that Corbynin check the shadow government is appointed by the grizzled John McDonnell valtiovarainministeriksi was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the ' 70s, when his isäpappansa pinnisteli on tv trying to be disloyal towards the Labour Party Government colleagues, however, without going so far as to lose the Government.
[7] at the pinnistelyt were more attractive.
But it's a struggle to remain involved, on behalf of the "situation in any" Benn utterance-was not what McDonnell said, and by all accounts what Corbyn told a private meeting of the pääreille and the immunities accorded to members on Monday night.
Any epähierarkkinen it, a sentimental and personal image by Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even related to me), the communication discipline is important in an era of 24-hour tv, and, in particular, the social media in the settlement, which is a breeding ground for the persecution of the harhoille and the opportune time for the fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give free tickets to Cameronille in Europe by allowing him to keep his labour party's support for a referendum on the campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins, at least, thinks so.
But McDonnellin and Corbynin peruskiertely for EU membership (and therefore, in line with their economic and intellectual antikapitalistisen Benn-controlled past) is no longer just an abstract discussion of vasemmistotoisinajattelijoiden, which is the central dogma of small differences in the narcissism of opillisissa nahisteluissa.
What will become of his kaksijakoisuuteensa Nato (Tom Watson is convinced siitäm that Corby was campaigning in order to transfer), foreign diplomats, you just have to try to explain it to his superiors.
Why Paris or Berlin would do well to spend political capital (they too are suspicious of the voters) to make concessions, when it can be completely pointless?
United States is already somewhat disappointed at the poor performance of the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even at the cost of cutting the Conservative Government is in power, as I was reminded on Monday as British Influence Security Forum-turvallisuusfoorumin.
Experts criticize Public Health England e-cigarette-review
Scientists have said that the State-funded agency's claim that 95% of the cigarettes are less harmful than traditional, was inspired by a 12-person meeting, where some had links to the tobacco industry.
The British Medical Journal (BMJ), write to Lancetiin, Public Health experts agreed with England (PHE) by the evidence in its report, an from tobacco.
PHE released this "milestone" in a report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive plan to synthesize the evidence".
Several researchers have, however, questioned the sustainability of the information referred to the connections between the tobacco industry and some of the experts.
The medical journal the Lancet published an editorial last month, which was attacked in the PHE:n the main conclusion of "exceptional huteraa base".
The other two BMJ:ssä kirjoittanutta researchers have considered whether or not the claims of "built on a rock or on sand."
At the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine-Professor of European public health school, Martin McKee, Professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, as well as Simon Capewell say: "the general principle is that public health practices, the effectiveness of the todistetulle must be set up."
They say that the public expect that the PHE:n argument ", according to the current best estimate of the electronic cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes," based on a detailed assessment of the evidence, and modeling.
In fact, it comes from one of the 12 meetings, which was developed by the monikriteeripäätösanalyysimalli (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions, which are combined with a variety of nicotine products, and the results of this meeting was firmed up in research.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was the Executive Director of the company, the trio of EuroSwiss Health explains in the past have received funding from the Bristish American Tobacco Company for independent research.
He will also support the sustainability of the public health authority report, the bat is to do, they say.
One of the 12 meeting of the people announced that they received funding from the manufacturer of your tobacco, but not the funding, which he is reported to have received the earlier tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The selection criteria for the members of the Panel did not explain, but the Panel includes a number of well known electronic cigarettes, supporters, some of whom are also in the field of the investigation that it had funding. telling
Others here are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Director of PHE:n tobacco.
Produced by the research group "paljonpuhuvasti", that there is a lack of evidence regarding the disadvantages "of most of the products and the majority of the criteria", McKee and Capewell writes.
Any of these links or the limitations does not, however, mention the PHE:n report.
McKee and PHE:n claims that the Capewell say "so far there is no evidence that the e-cigarette works as a route to the burning of children or non-smokers" to be premature.
PHE:n the Director of the health and well-being of Professor Kevin Fenton says, that BMJ:ssä the allegations have been answered in the past.
He says: "Electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than the burning."
Half life polttaneista die riippuvuuteensa.
All the evidence points to the fact that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we have to continue the examination of the impact of the long term.
PHE:llä has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show the relative dangers of tobacco, in particular when compared to so much public epätietoutta.

By explaining the current evidence-that is, even if tobacco or are not risk-free, the disadvantages are only a fraction of a traditional tobacco-damage-we fulfil our national responsibility.
The BBC would do well to give up EastEndersistä, says a former Channel 4-Director
The former Channel 4 Chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors "would give anything" such hits as, for example, this Albert Square-Street television SOAP series.
Johnson said that the licence fees should only be used for the adoption of programmes by other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticised the BBC for having put public service programmes which are likely to have a smaller audience, critical watersheds of the competitors of the most watched programs and for those premium channels, like a BBC4.
The Director-General of the BBC, after Tony Hall said the company wants to make more cooperation with other organizations, Johnson said, that he came to Channel 4 's once for a period of six years to create a relationship with the BBC, to no avail.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC to produce and broadcast programs, which would be a clear subventoimattomille to the competitors," Johnson said in the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its research on the future of the BBC.
If the fee is regarded as closed-and I'm not sure that it would be for the medium or long term, a good idea-it should at least limit their production to such programmes, that others do not do and produce.
The Voice will be sent to the main broadcast at the time, because its future is to collect as much support as possible.
The idea that no one else seems to, is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly a nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why the regressiivisen tax should fund the programs that could be financed without State aid.
The Voice is a one of a kind and EastEnders the other, admittedly within the House.
Frankly, the other channels would give any of it.
I do not understand how it is a matter of the public service.
I do not think that it would undermine the BBC at all. "
Channel 4 for the period 2004-2010 led to a series of entrepreneurial Johnson said, that the BBC is guilty of katsojamäärien for hunting "there because of the people working in the objectives, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He comments on the BBC's most popular shows are similar to the former sky's Director Tony ball, in the comments. He spent the 2003 MacTaggart-lessons in Edinburgh in order to propose, that the BBC would sell the kits as EastEnders.
Johnson said that a smaller audience of the BBC public service programs "go BBC4:lle, which often cannot be measured in a katsojamäärää, but the BBC fills in the way responsibilities and can then licence fee income of £ 4 billion defending the hypocrisy, to say, ' sure, we'll do all of these unknown programs that no one is looking".
They put they broadcast the scene, in which no one is ever going to take a look at them.
Permission for the Committee, "Johnson said, I challenge you to look for regressiivisemmän system in it, who gets the most value for your money.
Sure you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year will get a lot of value for your money, but I do not know whether it is true for those people, for which 150 pounds is big money, because they do not use the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 's Director of David Elstein, who also testified to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should review its early of Reith amidst the mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said that only a small part of the production to be classified by the BBC today, training-he said figures to be 1% of the TV production and 0.1% on the radio-and that it should be modelled on the Australian and Canadian yleisradioilta and change the task to "inform, educate and entertain".
As regards the partnership questions, Elstein said, that the BBC should focus more on the events such as the Proms concerts, which according to him will be on tv just a few, and with commercial companies in such a way that all of these should be viewable online.
"The sound of genetics" enables brain cells to control the sound of the waves help
The video shows you how to use nematodes direction as soon as the sound of the impulse hits them.
Researchers have increased the worms, which is genetically modified neural systems, so that they can be used to manipulate the sound wave outbursts.
The tiny roundworms switch as soon as they hit the sound-impulse, which is too high for the human ear to hear.
Impulses are working on genetically-modified nerve cells with ultrasound waves respond to membrane channels.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain-activity light
The researchers said that the worms are showing a new, äänigenetiikaksi, named for the method. The ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells in the body from the outside.
La Jolla, California-based Salk Institute researcher Sreekanth Chalasani told The Guardianille that the method may one day replace the syväaivostimulaation. It is an invasive procedure in which the human brain is derived from the electrical impulses to the Parkinson's disease.
Roundworms do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they are surrounded by the liquid, which is microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He discovered that the bubbles was confirmed by ultrasound waves, which are then run through the worms.
Fixed ultra sound waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, structures, of which there are some worms the cell membranes.
The sound of the waves will get these ionikanavat to open and activate the adherent cells, multiply the Nature Communications published in the report.
In order to prepare for an ultrasound controlled shuttle worms, edited by Chalasani worms, genetically, so that part of the nerve cells is TRP-4-ionikanavat.
When the ultrasound was used by the custom matoihin, Chalasani micro bubbles confirmed the sound waves and they are on top of the matoihin, where they formed a business nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as the optogenetiikassa, a ground-breaking tool, which will give scientists the opportunity to connect nerve cells on and off the light impulses.
Chalasani sonogenetiikan, however, says that there can be some advantages in comparison with optogenetiikkaan.
In contrast to the light, which must be sent to the optical fiber along the desired location within the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can travel through tissue through the barrier, so they can be sent from the brain to the skull.
"We believe that the gene therapy and the therapeutic use of the virus may be able to get a subject to human nerve cells in certain neurological ultrasound signal temporarily to respond to treatment in the clinical setting", Chalasani said.
The other application would be able to focus on the muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Eight golden rules of student-dormitory for living

Sixten Korkman, wrote a chapter in the book: the topicality of the Capital-"Marx you should become familiar with the"
The world economic crises have brought to the surface of the Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his work on the philosophy of Capital in 1867 – 1894 published, write Gemma Arterton, as a former Chairman of the famous George H in Marx's Capital is published today.
"He now takes more seriously than in a long time," H to write a foreword to.
The development of the capitalist economy, the internationalisation of the Marx reviews and increasingly widespread access by all sectors, the concentration of capital, as well as the growing role of financial capital and fictitious capital, have proven to be an amazing kaukonäköisiksi.
Hakasen the kirjoittajalistasta in the capital organised by the seminars can also be found in Wave-Sixten Korkman, a respected professor at the University of talousosaaja.
The current in the Korkman, write to Marx's "now and forever".
I guess the former Industry Research Institute and Managing Director of the business and not a Marxist?
Not this time.
Korkman says on the phone, that he did not like Marx, but rather as an attractive social writing as a timely talousajattelijana.
Today, the social sciences are diversified and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, Economist, journalist, political agitator and literary works.
"The usual perception is the fact that the opinions of dead men for the wrong idea of history tells us," Korkman start.
It is true that Marx's predictions went drastically wrong.
Even Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he pulled out the beginning of capitalism, it is going to too far to bulky, Korkman says.
But, however, the value of Marx's radikaalissa in mind the Korkman, see.
"Relevantimpaa Marxissa is it that he asked good questions," he says.
We are now discussing the distribution of the assets of interest such as the Marxinkin again.
"Marx may be able to provide inspiration for anyone who wants to understand the big picture of the victim, as a result of the changing technical world," Korkman analyzes.
But that's what the Government should be tomorrow to decide, not Marx.
His mielestäänhän capitalism was a hopeless case, that should just stop.
Still, in the opinion of Marx should Korkman, to become familiar with.
"in the ' 70s Deleuze, was unable to read the" Korkman said.
"The Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects hated all of capitalism, but even more to each other".
Today, the debate is more diversified, and Marx can be approached without fine-tuning them ideological and political weight of the cargo.
"For every yhteiskuntatieteilijän should get acquainted with Marx's idea of the world-as the other classics of the" Korkman said.
The UNITED NATIONS calls for war criminals prosecuted in Sri Lanka
The UNITED NATIONS calls for the establishment of the erikoistuomioistuimen in the civil war in Sri Lanka to investigate the war crimes, the news agency AFP says.

The fourth issue was according to a pretty nice Lybeck's.
It had to write fire the President, why companies should hire the young people to work.
"At least we in our school is practiced the words in your writing," Lybeck said, and evaluate the entire experiment "quite normal".

The arrival of tens of thousands of demonstrators, the police, in anticipation, to Helsinki-support patrols elsewhere in Finland
The Government's cutting decisions oppositional demonstration comes close in downtown Helsinki on Friday, predicting the police.
According to advance information, the site can arrive up to tens of thousands of people.
The SAK poll, STTK:n Union members meet Akavan Erityisalojen Keskusliitto and railroad square at 11.
The police is believed to be involved in the scale.
At work is the task of the police, in turn, not only the tasks and the rest of the police action, but also to secure the left mielenilmauksen.
The Railroad leading to the roads will be closed to motor vehicles, approximately at 9:30 am-14.
Only emergency vehicles in the territory.

So far, at least, it seems that it is enough.
I do not comment on matters of industrial action by the police.
Helsinki is Kujalan according to the coming gathering of support patrols elsewhere in Finland.
The exact amounts of the police patrol does not tell you.
"There has been some coming, but as a general rule, we deal with the Yes on our own," Clare says.
Police urge the use of private vehicles in the city centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Ian believes that the worst of the gridlock extends from Hakaniemi to level.
Standing traffic is expected in the morning until early evening.
Guests arriving from other parts of Finland, with the demonstrators in Helsinki is also becoming a lot of order.
They are not allowed access to the railroad.
The buses are, in principle, the time away from.
The rest of the way to keep the place ", then walk to demonstrate Kujala will tell you.
Demonstration of the Helsinki public transport stop also.
The police point of view this is a positiivinenkin.
Public transport in the fluidity of the issue, which is normally on hand for these large personnel gatherings, then abandon it now itself.
Gathering organizers have reported to the police, that the economic policy of the Government in Helsinki may receive tens of thousands of opponents.
Police expect the gathering to ensure smooth.
Väkihän is a regular working or unemployed people-ordinary people.
Yes, Finns are sensible and peaceful people, "Clare says.
In different parts of Finland will be held on Friday, also local demonstrations.
Friday's demonstration is in many ways an exceptional-do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Trade unions on Friday organized by the big demonstration is in many ways the most interesting and unusual.
It does not, for example, be found in Finnish political history a very good reference point, says professor emeritus of sociology, University of Jyväskylä, Martti Siisiäinen.
As such, it is no wonder that the trade union movement protested.
If it does not do, it would push the Board in front of your hands up, Siisiäinen says.
A very right-wing Government has been struck by a Finnish korporatismin in the tradition of the core points and also to the points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The Government's tough missing contract law.
This is where a lot of the features of the fact that the trade union movement, indeed, trying to get down on his knees.
At the same time, also in the ay-on the go is a mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, that is why, that is not all of the employees ' Trade Union on the move to support Friday's mind be willing to.
The new Division, which is now a drastic demonstration makes it among the employers would like to take part in the demonstration.
From all over Finland gathered the unemployed demonstrated in the parliamentary Hall in November 1993.
If the mind of looking for a comparison, could it be the unemployed, left the demonstration, in 1993 organized the transition period on Thursday, Siisiäinen says.
In the middle of the deepest recession organized during adolescence on Thursday brought together 20 000 people are unemployed.
Esko AHO (Center Party) Government stumbles from crisis to crisis in the labour market.
It was said that the Finnish Government and the wage earner organisations intervals never been as poor as during Aho's right-wing Government.
Now the Government and the labor movement are perhaps even worse than during adolescence in Thursday's times.
Moreover, the Government of Finland has now a very right-wing ever, Siisiäinen says.
The current Government coalition is still in the way of the more interesting, that it is so tough right-wing rhetoric of the true Finns party.
Yet there was a certain jytkyn at the time of the old labour movement elements.
The site is expected to be on Friday, several thousand protesters.
Demonstration to stop the public transport and closing schools, day nurseries, as well as possible.
Even if the demonstration gets the undivided support of employees, it may become the largest in many years.
In Helsinki, has in recent years organized a demonstration of around 300 each year.
They are side by side.
Traditionally, the Finnish trade union movement, the protests have been relatively peaceful in recent years-even though the practices become quite tough.
Traditionally, there is a demonstration to avoid conflict with the Finnish law-abiding.
The protesters are trying to avoid the damaging or destruction of property, Siisiäinen says.
in the late 1990s brought a new impetus, however.
Protest culture changed.
EU membership was farmers to throw eggs, and police prepared to get on top of a pig in shit.
Firefighters strike lasted for three months in 1998.
Spectacular strikes was also, among other things, pilots and air traffic controllers.

Popular science author: S to take a big risk
According to the Assistant Secretary-General, for a broad range of communication channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one of the channel among others.
Also this kind of direct speech channels is needed in the future.
This is not going to stick around for the last time, S told journalists in Parliament.
S did not want even to estimate how often a recurring way of tv and radio speeches of the Prime Minister will be.
According to the Assistant Secretary-General, speeches may not always be ignored in future Reject channels.
If other channels has registered as a channel, so it is considered then.
Now this evening, this channel is used, S said.
According to the Assistant Secretary-General, the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio speech to the public.
This issue, where we are talking about, it is pretty complicated and requires a longer argument.
That's why we ended up with this channel, S.
The speech will be sent at 26.14-21 and is now on Finnish television and Radio in Finland.
You can also look at the Yle Areena.
S take a big risk
Media researcher hopes that the Assistant Secretary-General, the President of the Government of the existence of a more inward-turning on the television to tell.
Is there an effort to take the definition of a public debate on the right to more firmly into their own hands and refuse to a public debate on the question of the layouts? reflecting on the Stockholm University Professor Anu K.
Comes to mind (Timo) Soini's recent comment that he follow the media agenda and not let it define themselves.
In the name of democratic debate and I hope that these matters are not related to each other.
K to understand that commercial media is incensed by the Assistant Secretary-General.
It would be strange if the media field does not react.
Policy makers, communication styles do not notice things in a democracy.
The role of the representatives of the media are, by definition, to the fact that processes be adapted to its politicians.
Koivunen's television speech is Sipilälle a big risk.
In his speech, Assistant Secretary-General, should bring to the table something new and special, to the exceptionally high expectations set out in the "road map" for not mincing her words.
Is today available in more of it, which we have already heard?
Or will he be able to speak in a different way, in a different way or in different words or to say something new?
K says that if the permit is just more of the same old, you have to wonder, why such a great gesture was made and the NYT gave it an exceptional time.
Ylekin to take this risk in the sense, if not a specific situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a danger that the speaker of Parliament and the Government, the politicians, or the NYT leimautuu viestimeksi, which is certainly not in line with the general interests of the YLE, the or.
Sipilä dodgy bet
In his speech before the Assistant Secretary-General, the future is also important for it, what he left unsaid, a media researcher stress.
The evening will be to watch carefully where S is missing and what is not, "says the University of Jyväskylä, research coordinator Rob Seal.
According to the tv-in mid-spring Sipilä dodgy bet, because this can be reached to bring your own views on the up in the air.
This message will provide the general public with no journalistic filter, as opposed to a press conference, where reporters can ask critical questions.
S to bypass the media and speak directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media will interpret the speech of something wrong, because of the additional questions is to get to.
In mid-spring, it is very important, how S is present on tv-whether fuel is leaking sweat, vapisevatko hands.
He compares the Sipilää father figure, who now tells people what to do.
If S knows how to present his case very well, it can work.
The situation is different than it was then, if the Government should inform you about something, as in man, as if talking directly to another human being.
This kind of (u.s. President Barack) Obama and the partners have on a regular basis.
Really exceptional
Political scientist Mike Crack to keep the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens really exceptional.
According to him, such has not been done in decades, that the Prime Minister will speak directly to the people.
An exceptional time requires exceptional efforts, Crack says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants in this way to get to the front of the Finns won over-kiristyksille.
Wage earner organisations to organise Friday's demonstration and strikes against the Government's actions.

The Social Democratic Party President Antti Rinne (sd.) shall inform the Assistant Secretary-General, sue for a dialogue.
Now is not the time to monologeille.

He published even in their own public Facebook page image, which he seems to kurkistavan armor of the vehicle can be placed quite a good atmosphere, and certainly not on the basis of the images it is not any of the why or suuttumisesta.
Utter nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I did not go inside the battle of panssarivaunuun, but it was the infantry fighting vehicle BMP-3.
Personally, I am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went there, I looked around and I came in peace out Komosomolskaja Pravdalle, Zotov said.

Anything that was not the case.
I went to the inside, and I came out.
I am tall and stalwart, but nothing of the sort, that I'd be somewhere stuck in your tank, did not take place, he said Russkaja sluzhba novostei-radio.
Zotovin words is supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged asenäyttelyssä why it has not been published, although a few during the day a total of 50 000 people.
The argument why the Zotovin was originally Bloknot.ru-took off from the site rimpuilleen, where the Zotovin were told about the tank opening out in an attempt to the end, and threatened to shoot all around, if he can not get pinteestään.
Later Bloknot-site published a sequel to the story, with the exhibition organizers told their own view of what has happened.
All are just used to it, that the soldiers jump quickly out of the panssaroiduista vehicles.
But, due to his large size, Member of Parliament, Zotov, simply lingered about, when he came out.
But is he any way sat there for five hours, said the Coordinator of the exhibition Alexander Pisarevski Bloknotille.

Similarly, part of the lost can be found at a later date, when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, the asylum seekers in Finland had a total of 134, which application was sunset 3651 decision on the ground that the applicant was likely to be moved out of Finland, so adults asylum seekers disappeared from 123 over the past year, he says.

This year, the aggregate loss of underage asylum seekers does not yet exist, but the number of applicants is therefore known to minors, and it has increased markedly, which is likely to affect the amount of the missing, he stresses.
How will the conversion to those of the decision?
Translations English to them, for example, "the black labour market"?
This is difficult to assess, since failure to comply with the implementation of the decisions taken on Finnish immigration service is responsible for the police, Kannelmaa.

A psychologist advises: How do you tell the children of refugees
Many a parent has had the last few days to think about, how do you tell a child on the situation of refugees in the continent.
Or is it worth it to tell you at all?
This issue does not need to take by force, a member of the Group of the SPR:n crisis, a psychologist at the Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children might want to protect, and not, for example, to let them watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they saw, and it can stay in motion, and the press, he says.
If a child has, however, come across the television news pictures of the refugees or heard elsewhere, it is worth to mention.
The debate is good to visit the child's starting point and to listen carefully to what he asks for.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily those of the older imagines he is terrified.
Children should not be intimidated to no avail, even though the thoughts of a haunting and pelottaisikin.
The smaller the child is closely following their parents ' behavior.
If the parents themselves will remain in the course of the debate calm, every child feels safe.
The bigger children collide with discussion of refugees likely to be in school, with friends, or online.
Parents is a good idea to take with them on the issue, if they are concerned about children.
The fact is that not all people in the world have things well.
Parents can work together with young children to think about how we in our families here.
We believe that in the end, however, the world is safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also be a variety of aspects of education-some of you may want to protect their children, as far as possible, fear.
On the other hand, if you are also talking about difficult issues, the child receives a model of how to deal with life in front of future difficulties.
This can be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "teach your kids to help the weaker"
At the end of my powers?
You can still have your child a good parent

Because Clover Ball lightning was a light exercise, Pohjola says she is positively surprised by the horse's last race.
It was the second record in a timely manner IT in Turku-Mare Tarun wind.
Clover Ball lightning was on very paineissaan, when it had been possible to drive normally only a few weeks.
Those things at the end of the light a small bending was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach to believe that the condition of the race made the oriille blades.
The horse's mood went from definitely moving forward, and I hope that it would also be leveled.

This is why you can't get rid of the useless iPhone apps
Apple's ceo Tim Cook.
At least some of Apple's iPhone-phones come with future programs might at some point in the future, but not quite all.
Apple is going to potentially in the future, to remove some of its own programs for the iPhone-phones, says the company's President and ceo Tim Cook in an interview with Buzzfeed.
The Apple iPhone can be found in a number of programs, which are relatively few uses: for example, FaceTime calls, newspaper kiosk, health, stock, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programmes, which came as an upgrade to the Apple iPhone to Watch, even if it is only necessary for Apple's älykellon owners.
Cook according to Apple's software is more complicated than that off the top of the display.
Some of the applications are linked to one another on your iPhone.
If they are removed, it can lead to problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook notes Buzzfeedille.
Cook did not mention what the Apple iPhone apps will work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work that way.
So with time, I think that we will be able to develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
Cook according to Apple, therefore, is looking into the matter, as the company does not want to waste memory space as the iPhone-enabled phones.

The u.s. Fed to try next tighten monetary policy
In the u.s. the next recession will start at less than a year, but more likely within three years after the country's Central Bank, the Fed will start again after a long time to raise rates.
And the financial markets decline begins in turn before the next recession.
The Fed has insinuated to launch as early as this week, and the interest rate, possibly by the withdrawals by the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession could weigh on the fastest course in the financial markets in autumn and rytinä it before.
Or at least that is the case, if the world's largest economy and the financial markets are acting as if they have been used and if they react to the Fed's monetary taps to blackmail as before.
Such conclusions are arrived at saksalaispankki Deutsche Bank London market strategists, Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in a broad study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed over a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study in a research report last week, the international suurasiakkailleen.
The study and the report drawn up strategists do not uskottele know, when exactly the Fed will raise rates, or what is going on in the economy and the market then takes place.
Instead, they represent the cold facts and calculations of economic statistics, how the economy and the market have in the past conducted themselves differently in the Fed's interest rate hikes at the time and afterwards.
In addition to the historical findings, they look at, what the key variables of the economy and the financial markets are now at the same time, or the second model than previous interest rate hikes at the time-and what may follow.
Clear is that as the financial markets are now economic than huterammassa in order to withstand interest rate increase than at any time in the past, then in the late 1950s.
The beginning of the recession, may not be less than
The Fed's current stance of monetary policy and to decide on the leaders in the early autumn of last summer and are along the implied that Commissioners were guilty, that the time to start lifting interest rates be ripe.
The first interest rates for more than a decade could come as early as this week.
The matter will be resolved Wednesday and Thursday, when the Fed's open market Committee meets to decide on the management of the so-called ' two-day meeting on this issue.
The last time the Fed raised the so-called Fed funds rate-the interest in June 2006.
Then came exactly two years of relatively small-0.25% of regular but by a series of interest rate hikes, which the Fed raised interest rates at 1.25% to 5.25%.
They started in 2007 the financial markets in the United States riskipitoisimman housing financing difficulties, and a year later the financial crisis was global in the day into a nightmare.
The great recession came in 2009.
The last time the serious setbacks in the real economy and the financial markets started more slowly than in earlier after the Fed's interest rate hikes has typically been the case.
Similarly, trials and tribulations were then more karumpia than at any time since the 1930s great depression.
Deutschen strategists are seuloneet of the world's largest economies and financial markets, as well as twists and turns since 1950 and in some places always have since the beginning of the 1800.
The Fed's rate cut, making their economic and financial impact they do report on since the 1950s.
The start of the recession is the fastest time in the first interest rate rise in less than a year, most often worn for less than three years and, on average, less than three-and-a-half years.
The rise in the financial market rate within the start of the Fed's two interest rate hikes-.
The Fed has alternately raised and dropped interest rates since the beginning of the 1950s, a dozen or more erimittaisen cycles.
Each time the other, and in some respects, has deviated from the times is relatively scarce, so on the basis of the review can hardly conclude nothing definite on the impact of the following interest rate hikes.
Strategists muistuttavatkin, that this time it is different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The crucial reasons for the financial crisis, let alone to blame for not getting beyond any doubt to find out even with decades of research.
But the three points into the crisis with its destructive power of kasvattaneista reasons, it would probably be about beyond any doubt aware:
1) the Fed, the ECB and the euro area, the other of the world's largest central banks kept interest rates unchanged in the twenty-first century too long too low.
They "patched up" the techno-bubble, and increased at the same time, the following.
2) to different parts of the real economy and the accumulated over the decades and already too large debt increased by the impact of the monetary policy of the central banks of the ylilöysän even more.
The biggest debt bubble in the history of the economy was born-date (YTD).
in particular, the financial economy approximately 3) pidäkkeittä compacted hullunhalpa debt financing market for most of the fiscal paisutti YTD/YTD budget in the history of some of the biggest price bubbles shares in real estate, bonds and commodities.
Nor barely generated a very fierce controversy, that more and more complex debt on financial markets were in the direction of the heights of the elevated levels of an unusually dangerous and unstable one, when the Fed and other central banks was driven by interest rates up last.
The debt on the valuation of the financial structures, much less after tuning levers of the bubbles do not stand as his time after the interest rate the cost of debt finance for the withdrawals had begun and had been converted.
The risks were realized in the financial crisis, and it was followed by the great recession.
The larger the bubble and more debt
Deutschen strategists do not guess work out of what happens next, but give tuumailun the subject by mentioning, for example, the following types of issues:
1) the Fed and other major central banks are now kept its monetary policy stance yet again, even longer than that before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, are still lower than they were even longer.
2) Debt is not for a long time been hullunhalpaa so than it was ten years ago, but now the debt money is low, which is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the financial and the real economy, debt loads are not wage earners, but now the economy is mired in a lot of different parts of a heavier debt load than before the financial crisis, or for that matter any time in the past.
3) More vuolaampana and cheaper liquidity of the central banks in the circulation of the left is for the most part, left the financial markets and brought with him the main types of securities and property of peak prior to the financial crisis kalleimmilleen then or never.
And the strategists warning of financial markets with latista atmosphere only, but in addition, they point out that even the u.s. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the recession in decades materials model than in the past.
In the euro-zone economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually poor condition but the pressure of financial markets and the risks by far the respectively higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next will tighten monetary hanojaan tighter.
Perhaps the one view of the future Albert Edwards of Societe ranskalaispankki Generalen picture is not as weird as the face can be affected.
He is already a good amount of time coached the international investor of the Bank clients the Fed's in the following täyskäännöksiin:
First, the Fed will raise interest rates, then we should say so in the financial bubbles burst and soon it is time flies to put out the financial fires an even bigger QE-money ruiskuilla.

The Western countries rejected the Ahtisaari proposal for a Russian guardian it: al-Assad of the
The Western countries rejected the Russian offer for more than three years ago, in which the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have been to give up power, says the President, Martti Ahtisaari, Guardianille.
According to the Russian Ambassador to the UNITED NATIONS of the Ahtisaari plan, which was proposed by al-Assad would be after some time turned away from power.
However, the Western countries have not taken up the proposal in the belief that al-Assad's fall anyway in a matter of weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012, the five permanent UN Security Council member countries.
According to the Russian Ambassador, Vitaly Tshurkin Ahtisaari listed him in a face-to-face debate on the three-point plan: the opposition did not get the arm, between the opposition and the al-Assad found it right away to get a phone connection and the renunciation of al-Assad had to implement a simple.
I Know Tshurkinin.
We may not agree on all issues, but we will be able to discuss openly.
I told him what I was doing out there and he said, that the sit down, John, so I'll tell you what we need to do in an interview with the guardian, he recalls.
The diplomats did not comment on
Ahtisaari says the message to the United States, the United Kingdom and välittäneensä Tshurkinin to France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin has not been confirmed by the content of the debate, but Ahtisaari on the tab, it is not two words.
The United Nations-diplomats refused to comment on the allegations, but Ahtisaari said that al-Assad's troops were already at that time made a number of massacres and the key opposition groups refused to all contracts, which he would have missed.
The British Foreign Ministry's Middle East Department, the former head of the Sir John Jenkins is Ahtisaari's speeches, because of his experience, Russia did not have any time available to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported the al-Assad, for the entire period of the war.
The weakest point of Ahtisaari's argument is that the mandate of the Moscow Tshurkin was talking about.
If he had told me that I would have lived up to the rhetoric, Tshurkinin, I would like to hear the same President, Vladimir Putin, in the evening, so that I can take it seriously.
Jenkins, he would be suspected, even in the case that it would have been Putin's gimmick to keep the power in one of the tukijalla of al-Assad.
The refugee flow from your own tekosiamme
During the Syrian crisis, Ahtisaari's negotiations was dead about 7 500 people.
The UN estimates that the number of deaths exceeded the 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
An influx of refugees, Europe has its own tekosiamme.
I do not see any other option than to keep one of these raukoista people take good care of.
We are paying for the Bill, which in fact we cost, he says.
The arrangement Centre of asylum seekers seen in Tornio
The Government in the North of the country designed by asylum seekers are likely to be invested in the organizing Centre will be set up.
In the Centre of the city of Tornio Centre would be established in yhteislyseon the building was empty.
The need for the Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place, so that the refugee flow to better management of the Swedish border.
The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the Council had already decided to put school buildings in the area as a solution to the Ministry of Justice.
The Tornio City Council Vice President Sauli Hyöppisen (left), it is not the case.
When the size of the Board of Governors was not in session and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to call a meeting for Monday to decide on the matter by the Board of Governors for the next, he explains STT:lle.
Location in the discussion was the 36 delegates from 43.
The arrangement of the Center objected to the 13 delegates.
On the basis of the positive decision might be expected, Hyöppinen says.
Timo Nousiaisen, the town was subject to be contacted on Monday, and responded to quickly.
Yhteislyseoon could fit an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has been inspected, that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is about 200 meters from the border, so it would be even if the mind working, Hoyer says.
S hopes are still in the labour market options kiristyksille
Prime Minister Juha according to Assistant Secretary-General (Center) in the public eye have been halving the Government would take care of only a part of the resort, from seeking work on the calculation of the price.
The Government will take to him, however, happy to accept the option package, if the social partners succeed in a fit.
S told the Parliament to journalists that he has not been in contact with the labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously associations are looking for alternatives, identified by the Labour Government of the kiristyksille.
If such an agreement is created, we will certainly welcome as part of the overall package.
In the opinion of the holiday as Assistant Secretary-General, halving it should be, because it would be almost all of the contractor as opposed to, for example, the Government outlined by the Sunday supplements.
The social partners could agree a holiday budget surgery, as they are enshrined in the law instead of the collective agreements.
The Government says these views on Wednesday of next week to Parliament, forced abortions and of the Council of State as the "communication of the working life.
Assistant Secretary-General, according to the organizations, the proposals should have known this before.
The final deadline for that.
The legislative work of the leaves when the movement of the train is on the move and it will go to all the time.
Now is a great time.
It is in such cases that long to go, if you will, S reformatted.
The Government last week by publishing the item is, inter alia, the twelfth night and change the palkattomiksi pursuant to the Ascension to the number of time without shortening.
In addition, one of the first sick days salary will be cut, including overtime compensation will be reduced by 75% of the cut in, Sunday, and holidays are truncated.
Reforms are implemented continuity of legislation for the trade unions of the past, which has attracted strong criticism.
As a result of the actions of the central organisations of employees on Friday, suurmielenosoituksen, and in addition, a number of unions have declared political strikes.
The Board of Governors adopted the SAP management inventory Tohmajärvi plugin
The Board of Governors unanimously adopted but a little grumbling, Tohmajärvi Nordic Koivu Ltd's management or SAP inventory management snap-in.
The criticism caused by the fact that the project is a bigger and more expensive than originally had been spoken.
The busy schedule of närästi.
All the little we were wondering, not need to been known a year ago, when it was decided that the previous plug-in.
At this point, inventory expansion 400-450 per square metre was adopted investment program, but the money will be decided later on in the context of the report of the interim report.
Yet the next item we talked about 150 000-200 000 euros of the investment, but the size of the event, the technical director Erkki Ikonen told me that the price will be approximately EUR 300 000.
Investment in favour on the grounds that it brings to the job and tax revenue for the locality.
Does not have the risk, since the company pays a rent of the investment, the Dodge (ps.).
Karjalan kielellekin place in the River mouth
The City Government is also thought to be a more radical position on karjalankielisten street name signs to the river mouth.
The new decision is an important one in terms of the preservation of tradition and added throughout the province.
Joensuu is the capital of the Karelian language, declare themselves to be, because there is no historical basis and the Karelian language is not an intrinsic part of the identity of the region.
Joensuu region spoken language has been more in the Eastern savolaismurteisiin.
Uudenkaan the decision of the center of the city is not going to karjalankielisiä street name signs.
The river mouth of the town, however, is also a good case-by-case harkinnalla for example, the Karelian language ready info tables and tourism marketing.
The same attitude to the city recommends that for all of the other operators.
Even though London is officially monolingual, so, too, the Karelian language should be avaramielisesti now, when multiculturalism is alive and turns sharply North-Karjalassakin.
Karelian language is still the province's special features, as well as the image of the mouth of the River, the whole Finland metsäpää.
They both may very well take advantage of the province in a wide variety of marketing.
Train connections to the liquidations will cut the province's vitality
The entry into force of the provincial railway cuts to affect the body.
Transport links have a direct impact on the competitiveness of the industry and the province.
And it seems that whether here in the first place to live and work, the river mouth on Director Kari K wonders.
He also raises the air traffic, with an extension has also been on several occasions, I have.
It is important for the whole of the province, that our opportunities to come out on the measures to reduce the power of the State, as it is becoming.
As a result of the effects of these transport links should be considered, for example, employment, K.
The deterioration of transport cause the University of Eastern Finland for more of a challenge in terms of the attraction.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport links and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and workers, the Rector of the University of Eastern Finland Jukka M notes.
He points out that poor transport links also affect the tutkijakuntaan, which is a very mobile and travel a lot because of the investigation.
Recruitment Manager, Marko Junkkarinen said that already on the market at the moment, of the University of the West of the country is difficult, because the transport links are in the transverse direction.
The students of the University of Eastern Finland is currently about half comes from outside of Eastern Finland.
Of them, again, about 10-20% is Raimo Vistbacka, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
The mouth of the River became one of the gravel voice of the Siun sotelle
The mouth of the River from a Municipal Department of the City Government's vision of the Siun-project is the seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel äänikin among them.
A member of the Board of the city P keskisalo (sd, pictured) was presented by the Government at Monday's meeting of the whole project, but his performance has lapsed.
The Board approved the draft decision, the city's Director of Kari Karjalainen reviewed yet at the beginning of October, before the meeting of the City Council, which will give the final opinion of the project at the same time, with all the other municipalities.

The u.s. Central Bank's policy makers are sitting this week for two days a huge mahogany table surrounded by the long-awaited meeting in deciding whether the time has come to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the Central Bank's ornate, two-story meeting rooms is a wall painting in the United States.
The map is a reminder that Central Bank President Janet l. Yellenin and his colleagues will need to set the nation's economic interests above all else.
Congress has fallen on the shoulders of the dual responsibility of the Central Bank: they need to maximize the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
The great depression after the Central Bank's leaders have, however, agreed that there is also a third, an unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is this third requirement may be the deciding factor in the decision on Thursday [10], which is so tight, that it cannot even predict. The decision as to whether or not the us economy ready for vieroitettavaksi of the record until the end of the year 2008 incentive at close to zero interest rates have remained at short term brought.
Although most of the information shows the recent turmoil in the global economy to grow at a steady, the financial markets can be made in advance by officials of the Central Bank on guard against more säikymmiksi, what will become of the volatility. There are fears, how would, if the federal funds rate-the reference value, to be increased by a quarter of a percentage point, even.
"Understandably, the labour market and the inflation rate are the first and the most important points, which will be monitored," said Lindsey Piegza, M., a brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co päätalous expert.
"I do believe, however, that if they are looking for the legitimacy of the closing date for the level of interest rates unchanged, with increased uncertainty in the global market has enough of a valid argument is still waiting," he says.
The Central Bank's decision has not been reached, which also gives rise to nervousness on the economy.
Bloomberg according to a recent study, about half of the economic experts predict that the level of interest rates rising this week.
The financial market while waiting for the Central Bank to delay the withdrawal, according to a key indicator for the opportunity for growth is only about 30%.
This refers to the stock market decline, if the Central Bank raises the level, if policy makers then successfully to soften the blow by promising that the next withdrawal is not going to happen anytime soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, a new chapter is 16 599.85.
The revival brought with it the expectation that the Central Bank to keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group-events which took place during päätalous.
"It is surprising, if the Central Bank to raise interest rates right now," he says.
If policy makers will raise interest rates, "they need to see a lot of effort into linjauksessaan in order to support the financial markets so that they do not have to panic."
Some experts claim that the elevated level of reassuring financial markets, since it would eliminate the uncertainty as to when the Central Bank operates.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the Central Bank would cut interest rates a quarter of a percentage point in putting, so taking the first small steps towards monetary tightening in the economy slow, which varmentaisi of the us recovery, stability.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer, that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals are demanding in their appeals, the more economic development.
Although the new job creation slowed in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1%, which is the lowest number in seven years, and close to the level of full employment by the Central Bank to keep the limit.
Wage growth has shown signs of a revival.
While inflation is still below the Central Bank's annual target of 2%, according to the Central Bank's policy makers, the main reason for this is a much lower oil prices temporary effect.
The economy "will survive suuremmistakin rate levels and also needs them, taking into account the tight situation in the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics-päätalous of the company.
However, it did shake the financial markets around the world last week, when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell by up to 16 percent of the toukokuisesta record, as investors feared China's slowing economy to slow down the global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow index is now close to 10 per cent less than during reading.
The Central Bank's policy makers to market turmoil is an additional factor in the complex equation that says because of the level of interest rates will be raised.
"Without these last few weeks of the financial market events and news coverage of the weakness of the Chinese economy, the makers of the kiristäisivät levels in this meeting," says Stephen d. Oliner, UCLA Zima by the Center for Real Estate-Center senior researcher and a former Central Bank official.
Now, he predicted, that the makers are waiting for at least a month in order to get a better idea of the impact.
"The potential impact on the u.s. economy are still very unclear, and they do not have much information at its disposal, what will be the consequences of the events in China," Oliner notes.
The international economic prosperity is not the Central Bank's concerns, so, in principle, it should not affect the decision-making process.
In practice, however, the Central Bank of the Federal State, has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the Central Bank's influence has been enormous.
In 2013, the then Chairman, Ben s. Bernanke, an intimation of the fact that the Central Bank would be able to "limit" the increase in the number of money, caused an upheaval in the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly punoutuneet to one of the officers of the Central Bank is expected to be not only the next development elsewhere, also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the world's economy.
The Central Bank's decision-making process is "more of an art than a science," says Zachary Karabell, Envestnet asset management Inc. and head of the global strategy of the company.
In the State of Virginia in Richmond, the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank) President Jeffrey Lacker noted this month that "the Central Bank has in the past, the financial markets overreacted to the movement that has been affected by the economic fundamentals of the separation."
Decisions the Federal Open Market Committee-the Committee has been calling for interest rate increase, and the right to vote of the Member of the Committee, Lacker, citing as an example the decisions in 1998-99.
The Asian financial crisis was caused by the fact that the Central Bank has cut the reference value 0.75 percentage points of the three during the meeting "in spite of its limited impact on economic growth in the United States, identifiable," Lacker said.
A year later, the Central Bank was overruled by these cuts.
The Central Bank should put economic stability a priority but a major crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, "said Adam s. Posen, Bank of England (Bank of England), a former member of the koronmäärittämiskomitean.
Most turmoil does not come anywhere near the levels, Posen says.
"Nobody wants a situation in which it is feared that the level of interest rates increase, therefore, that the market harmistuvat", Peterson Institute for International Economics, President of the Institute for Posen says.
Federal law on the Central Bank (the Federal Reserve Act) still contains the text which responds to the demand, and not to mention economic stability. As long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Bariatric Surgery can help, to put it mildly obese diabetics
According to the new research, to put it mildly obese type 2 diabetics gained by the benefits of Bariatric Surgery can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say, should go through this, to put it mildly obese diabetics diet pills after surgery for a longer period than those treated with other methods than surgery.
"Mortality data takes a long time," Dr. Robin Blackstone notes. He is a Bariatric Surgery specialist, who wrote the editorial in JAMA, Surgery-a new research.
Losing weight-or bariatrisissa surgery is used a variety of methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They will reduce your hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, the cuts in the Bariatric operations have proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of the surveyed persons has been morbidly obese, and their BMI (BMI) has been 35 or more.
The BMI or the length of the ratio between the weight of it is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If YOUR BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and a person's BMI is over 30, he is considered to be obese.
You can calculate your own BMI:si here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
This new research, scientists at the taiwanilaisessa Min-Sheng General Hospital-the hospital used information collected from 2007 to compare two types of trained in bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, as well as the reduction of stomach, lääkkeellisiin treatments of type 2 diabetes in humans, who were, to put it mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI fell to cut people out of 31 24.5% by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, those individuals that were treated by other means than with surgery, more or less the same BMI remained 29.
From the 36 percent of people with diabetes improved to 28% of the whole and in part.
By comparison, only maintained group diabetes improved used medicinally by 1% and in part about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL-kolestori "were, in General, the better the cutting group," the authors said.
Researchers followed the patients ' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect the blood sugar levels over the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c value less than 7%, the researchers write.
Postoperative hemoglobin A1c level fell by about 9% to around 6%.
Medical treatment for the group, however, it remained stable at around 8%.
This better "glycemic control", which improved the hemoglobin A1c levels describe, does not, however, reduced the mortality rate in five years, says principal investigator Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team compared the average results of the two different types of surgery.
In the case of the fifth year, when it was compared with the gastric reduction surgery, gastric bypass surgery in the group that went to become the Group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), down painoindeksiään more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased hemoglobin A1c-levels more (3.1% and 2.1%), and was more likely to have achieved the perfect diabetesremission (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona's College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says, although the investigation is not survival of the fittest or the surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where the surgery led to a longer life painavemmilla people.
The Swedish study found that Bariatric Surgery käyneillä liikalihavilla was 29 per cent lower than the probability of dying from a 15-year period, when they were compared with a group that had tried the more traditional treatments.
Even if the new research is not an improvement in the survival of patients undergoing surgery, Blackstone says, that the results are, however, encouraging to people whose BMI is less than 35 and those who are interested in the surgery.
"The results of the research are crucial in that they show that surgery is safe for a lower body mass index group", and does not involve an elevated risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that, for both patients and their lääkäreidensä by weight should be taken very seriously at the stage when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we are waiting too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, the situation is very difficult.

It would provide a unique perspective.
Journalists, of course, have the opportunity to keep track of executions in America, and as the applications there is often more than the number of available seats, the participants will be selected through a terrible draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for the media from 12 to 5.
Who ever then valitaankaan, believes the event will refresh you.
I am not in a position to do so.
I'll sit next to Richard Glossipin of my closest friends, and I have created him for my own as well as one to two months of phone calls and an hour of relaxation through the visit.
I like the man.
Laugh often jutellessamme.
Prison authorities say that I cannot be both a witness and a vendor, so I do not have with me the notebook and pen partitions that I saw.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist blamed on Twitter that I have compromised on neutrality regarding the.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story of her in any way, so you get involved in.
I complained to the vendor.
Carbon monoxide admitted that "it would be able to lay out the words better," but it is still of the opinion that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip had I typed sanomieni and disagree with some things.
He does not say to me what do I need to write, and I would do so, although he would not say.
I said to him, that he may at any time remove me todistajalistaltaan.
But he wants to, that there is an international journalist, who writes on the subject.
If the Glossip dies, he believes, that the publicity will help the death penalty trend.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is by my side.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to my podcasts in the series.
I am not going to go through this all over again with all the details.
I am not in a position to say with any certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treesen would do him in any case, the assistance of the offender.
But I think that is a very strong possibility that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe that the absence of evidence of the death penalty was not enough.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And this, then, is the perspective from which I watch her die.
I can say that I am totally unbiased.
There's going to be the other journalists, who take care of it.
From me you will get a description of what it feels like to look at, when a man, which I like, die unnecessarily.
The man enticed out of the Canning River-the river of the watery police hunt after
Canning Vale Constable remained dry, when he attracted the man out of the Canning River-River.
Perth from man's attempt to mislead the police • went wrong, when he found himself on the low, muddy waters of the water only yards away from the police about the man, who was trying to "entice him gently back to the beach".

Constable Lachlan univormunsa kastuvan Perhavec did not want to, so she used a safer tactic: "the condition of the police, a negotiation".
"Sometimes people do funny things while trying to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.

Peter Moody claims officials tried to spy on him and threatening to stop competing
Peter Moody has argued, that the Racing Victoria stewards attempted to infiltrate the vakojaan his talleihinsa in the past year, and threatens to stop competing with immediate effect.
He blames the means and Racing Victoria lahjomattomuusjaostoa, arguing that they have a personal campaign by running against him. On Wednesday the rejection of race day of the Lady Tatain late treatment because the measure was the last rivet.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he is the victim of an unexplained tested positive for an awkward situation Lidarin cobalt sample.
He has held his tongue in check in terms of vakoojaväitösten for a year and a half, and did not want to, that "it would look like kateudelta".
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I have long been silent on the matter, but sometimes it get frustrated so much that all unwinding at once," Moody said.
They knew that the situation of continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the sanctions, and I have to live with it, what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and I sleep very well.
I would like to walk with their heads held high, and I want the owners to think that I will do my best in front of them.
When they start to think differently, then I should not continue as coach.
Then I would need to consider, what do I do lisenssilleni.
In the past the Moody racing.com tipautti bomb-site interview in which he said that lahjomattomuusosasto had been trying to spy on his team.
"A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in the room with a guy-I name him when asked and offered him work in the talleillani, if he cares about it, what do I do there.
They clearly consider me a crook.
If that is so, indeed, they should tell their lawyers because they have failed in my nappaamisessani.
Robert Roulston, Racing Victoria's former President, David Moodie, Racing Victoria's current Chairman, and Bernard Saundry, Racing Victoria's current Managing Director, were all aware of the matter at that time and are aware of today.
Should I start to think that this is becoming a personal?
Is there a Victoria Racing at last decided to transfer responsibility for other miehistyä and, perhaps, as the coaches on the field, what happens?
Am I malicious?
Am I so negative?
Perhaps people think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me aside, and I am in no doubt that now, said things might get them thinking about exactly that.
But I'm now at the point that I do not care anymore, and it suretaa me.
It really saddens me.
I urge them to make a decision, which is their responsibility.
I have my family to support, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown with the research, and long-term Lidarin cobalt late rejection caused him to say, that could "throw the licence over the table".
Moody, who is best known for the unsurpassed master of the Black Caviarin coaching, has called the race of the day care the rule "ridiculous" after the mud or clay poultice is inserted into the horse's legs, which is illegal.
"It is against the rules of the competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
One of my staff suggested seeking to put the feet in the mud, by mistake.
It could have been a bath last night.
It would have been able to have it today, as it was.
It was race day.
Moodylla may be facing a three-month competition ban for race day as a poultice treatment, which officials began their investigation.
It is a joke.
The people who draw up these rules, do not know anything about horses.
"All of us understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.

Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy attacked team against competitors wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy has strongly criticised the two NRL-rugbyliigan champion of the favorite arguments of the fact that his team would be part of the "orientations" permitted.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees are raised in the Storm "wrestle" with your own side, when it surprisingly won the final qualifier in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett at the top just barely cover up the reference to the Storm after it won the North Queensland the Cowboys on Saturday night in the final qualifying round. Bennett called the game rugbyliigan "sample window" and said that the two Queensland teams were "very enthusiastic" in Greco-Roman.
He defended the team's tackles, and said that they only focus on the "contact" taklatessa.
He added that his confidence increased the two leading coach critique towards the Storm, because it means that they are afraid of the beaten team.
"This is always going to speech I heard Trent Robinson talk about painimisesta, when we lost to them, 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed any of the defense systems or tekniikoissamme for the whole year. In the last six weeks we have only stressed the contact with the taklauksissa, and it has led us to succeed.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he is obviously a great team, another Finnish steeplechaser, so he's probably not used to go away, and this was a small shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of the year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett thought "the exciting rugby" by reminding the mentoriaan of the valmentama of St George Illawarra Dragons won Bennett the Championship in 2010, by playing the "tylsästi".
Wayne talks about the exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare the Saturday-night game in our Friday night singularly and tell you how exciting their game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how to St George was criticized often for the fact that it is a boring team, and Wayne said, that could care less about.
But now he has a team that will be able to play the kind of rugby, which we consider to be an exciting time, especially when he has a quick, young friends.
The kind of game you want to play, when you have the type of players.
He brought it to the side of the 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of Rugby-is that the team have some friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt, in order to play it that way.
I think it will be more confident when they say such things, because they are a little bit concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they're probably not thought about us the spiritual successor of the important games.
He also pointed out that the game was between the Storm and Roostersien pisterikkaampi as Broncosin and Cowboysien in between.
The Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how it ended? 16-12?
Our games was 20-18, so we had two goals more, but whether it's the exciting rugby?
Or make it an exciting defensive line and paint failure?
To me this is all about.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we will be able to play against them.
Stormilla is free this weekend, as they have already won the right to a home game in either the Cowboyseja or the Sharkseja against North Queensland in Cronulla next Saturday-night esifinaaliin AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.

The arsenal Captain Mikel Amatriain says, that a team with your friends will need to support the injured Jack Wilsherea ahead of Dinamo Zagreb's draws
Wenger has also impressed upon the Wilshirelle, that is until September and, on the assumption that he's reabsorption into goes according to plan, there is no reason why he should not be by Christmas while playing.
In the best case for at least the next four Wilshireltä remains in the English game, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he next summer's European Championships.
The biggest shame in the most recent problem is that Wilsheren the end of last season, had a strong following, and a single ankle injury, he looked back on the old terävyyttään before the start of the season.
"This type of injury is not a threat to a career," Wenger said.
It is bone that has not healed properly.
It is nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It is not related to his previous injuries, nilkkoihinsa, or what he has been.
This may be true from the medical point of view, but also, as Wenger acknowledged, the Player attempts to go back to the middle of the risk of further injury is always there.
Becoming is also uncomfortable.
Premier Injuries Ltd-the company's studies show that the Wilsherellä has been in 23 different injuries after that, when he made his debut six years ago.
In addition, he is the last of five during the season played in Arsenal's 157 League game just 65 in the game.
When viewed in a broader context of Arsenal after the 2007-08 season, six of the eight it has been one of the Premier League team, which has lost the most days.
Wenger admits the vicious cycle, but Arsenal believes that their last season in the repentance of the disability statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when you press the disability may be prone to permanent, in which case you need to strengthen your body and have competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope that her body stabilizes, I am sure that that is the case, and that he will be made a career as worthy.
Wenger is preparing for the Recycle team, while Arsenal's start to the Champions League game against Dinamo Zagrebia playing on Wednesday evening after a Saturday Chelsea'a and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur and the England national team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Amatriain are likely to start.
Wenger may also put Kieran Gibbsin and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal's and Theo Walcottin.
"I try to maintain a balance and to give a breathing space for the players," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is the clear favorite of the F-block, Maksimirin Stadium in Zagreb is the terrifying illnesses are undoubtedly those.
Dinamo is also not lost on 41 in the match after that, when they produced their own "Indestructible" campaign last season.
The stadium shook Tuesday night earthquake, that volume was 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have taken the lessons of last season's UEFA Champions League capitulation against the Principality of Monaco, and he motivates more and more a distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never reached it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, can I be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we do not haaveksijoita.
FriendsFest: a sitcom that taught us the serious matters of friendship
It is striking how similar the descriptions is not a series, particularly in view of the fact that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and young men have the highest suicide rates higher than in the last 15 years.
In 2013, the suicide was the biggest cause of death in the 20 to 45-year-old males in the Uk, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
The Campaign Against Living Miserably in the company address the problem (CALM) announced the end of the 2015 men's years. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of this challenge of balancing.
In a recent study, there were more than 2,000 high school and live in a students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, a person's ability to recover from a doubled, if high enough prosenttiosa of his friends were "in a healthy mind".
As well as those who were not depressed, the probability of the appearance of potential mental health problems, was cut in half, if they had a mentally healthy friends.
But to friends to work, it must be the first available.
In social media through the contents of the communication within the style goes over and the immediacy of the response is often more important than the relevant contact.
Digital life are necessary to affect a strong, happy and doubled the menestyneeltä, even if the reality of isolation.
This superficial success dominated by values that psychologists call the external: money, image, social status. All of this is done in the internal values-an internal desire for personal growth and to the detriment of the friendship-that affect in a deeper way to mental health.
And as for the billionaire video game developer explained recently, money does not really get more happiness.
Known fineness was just in the fact that it turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters are not defined by their work, but rather to their personality, which stood out clearly to interact as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous comfortable chairs, watching the hugs, moments in football, Ross ikävöimässä Rachel-the humor came from the knowledge that, Yes, men can identify with all this, even though they're often hesitant to explore their feelings fully.
Such as the Samaritans, a volunteer from the organization explained to me: ... "when I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I really understood how the slightest interaction with a friend can improve."
Often let us know take the men feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old adage "getting over" is strong, as well as the feeling that if the problems are seen as a weak open.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I'm trying to provide longer-lasting coping mechanisms.
It was highlighted by the men's friendship, small moments.
Even if an objective, external drive at the other end of the phone to help people in moments of despair, a longtime aid comes from the nearby, a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you participate in Comedy Central's FriendsFestiin this weekend, and all of the places is a celebration in honor of the designed, why don't you take your friends for a coffee in the Central Perkiin.
Or, better yet, if you can see the lonely, smile and say hello to someone in Starbucks.
You can never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central's from beginning to end, all 236 episodes, taking part in the #FriendsFest ' to
Di Maria makes it to the finish line and help PSG:tä läimäyttämään Malmö 's page
Angel Di Maria celebrates with goals by Blaise Matuidin and Edinson Cavan town of Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in the UEFA Champions League to enter the business, helping PSG:tä get past ruotsalaisjoukkue Malmo on Tuesday.
Below the match report and the reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were right on the line, when Paris Saint-Germain started the Champions League game in the end with a nice 2-0 victory against Malmö the Parc des Princesissa on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the Champions League enter the goal less than four minutes, pointing to the French League champions missed a number of opportunities, but the team the road before finally increased their lead over Cavan strikes paint 61. by the minute.
Paris, which is in the same block of Real Madrid and as Roma (A)-with a strong start in Donetsk, needed a Swedish League Championship because the game was not just a place, but also for the improvement in their quarter finals in the last three games leading up to the round
But even though PSG took the score, it was not a classic game, as Laurent Blanc's team in front of the goal and Zlatan Ibrahimovic missed on later changed course. Malmö is in his old hometown team, and it team, where he began a brilliant career in 1999.
"The Champions League is not easy to win at home or away, so a 2-0 victory to produce problems to your opponent, and to look good in the statistics, and is a good start, even though it is the things that we have in this period to refine," Blanc said.
This pointed towards the good.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we managed to make one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury after a change in the pariisilaisjoukkueeseen in one of the three after the team missed the 2-2 draw at Ligue 1 's home game against the Bordeauxia over the weekend, but he stayed in the fourth minute, Di Maria.
When he moved on to Manchester United last month, Argentine winger was named after a man, who takes PSG:n to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when you ran the Marco Verrattin supply caught up behind the defensive line and the Malmö, after being struck by the beautiful finish of Johan Wilandin, past the corner of the net.
However, if someone was waiting for PSG:ltä easy and large profit, he had to be disappointed.
Malmö was stuffy. It was won by Celtic if he should ever get to that level, the solution to match the opening kentällisessä has nine international players and viisimiehinen defense as well as the two players deep in the midfield.
But the team did not offer the attack side of little more than Nikola Djurdjicin shot 34. a minute that went just over the goal post, Kevin Trapp.
Instead, PSG had a shortage of lost entries, and between the poor, in particular, Ibrahimovicilta, which failed in all five of the company only in the first half-time and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in the contact as soon as the second half at the beginning of the Ibrahimovicin.
He, however, was much more effective in making people to his colleagues, and it is Ibrahimovicin input Di Maria sent a spiral kick, that leaning Wilandin paint pole with around 52. minute mark.
The second goal was the sixth goal of the season in the end an hour after the game, thanks to the place of the shares in the Cavan after Ibrahimovic was näpäyttänyt forward to Maxwell's cross from the left input.
It ran out of Malmo hopes to get back in the game, and only Wilandin a great Luizin direct kick in a fight against David was supposed to end at the bottom, before the sales become Ezequiel Lavezzin paint was rejected just at the end of the game.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were one level higher than his team. A Norwegian said: "Viimeisein in the Champions League game was in December of last year."
Since then, we have played in the Swedish League, which is not the same.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I raise my hat to a couple.
This was an awesome game from them.
