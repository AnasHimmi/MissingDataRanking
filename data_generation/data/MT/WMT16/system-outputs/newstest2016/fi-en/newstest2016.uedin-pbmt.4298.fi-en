The teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during a 911 call
Voice only slightly trembling university teacher Shannon Lamb speaks during an emergency call to the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Mr Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably upset, and said that the dead woman's relatives, the contact details of this phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss's notebook page handwritten message: "I am so very sorry I wish I could take back that I loved her, and she is the only woman who has ever loved me," said the letter, which is signed by Lamb, according to the experts.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses Minnesota Cleveland Delta State University, had already traveled nearly 500 miles on the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed the history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, the door of the Oval Office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford told university staff heard about the shooting at 10: 18.
He said Lamb called the dramatic 911 call for some time after that.
By the end of the day, the death toll rose to one: Lamb committed suicide when police surrounded and treat her.
Authorities are still trying to figure out a motive Lamb day after pupils and staff had been due to a school shooting hide behind closed doors.
Scientists on both sides of the state, they have published information according to which the students and staff described the Lamb gifted teacher, but one with potentially had problems.
The students said they had expected his feelings.
Prentiss place of death, the desert, the police say that Lamb had a violent past or a criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb wrote in the book, in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared the academic life.
Both taught history and social sciences department, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many students participated in the course of both men.
On the other hand, there were some visible signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised the Lamb, but also said that he seemed nervous and agitated, "as if something had gone wrong."
Another student Mikel Sykes said Lamb told me that he had a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Mr Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's recruitment policies meant that even though Lamb had worked hard for their PhDs, it doesn't automatically did her career development and assistant professor's posts.
University William La Forge said that between Lamb and Schmidt, for her to know there was no contradiction, but that "clearly Lamb had something in mind."
These questions, Lamb is no longer able to answer.
After Lamb had fled the campus, police got on his trail, when he moved back to Mississippi state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Mr Lamb shot himself .38-caliber pistol in the back yard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Mississippi Greenville, told the Washington County coroner Mets Mitchel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running on the driveway.
Wasn't immediately clear why the Lamb just got this house, although Johnson said he believed that the Lamb knew the people who live there.
Mr Lamb grew up in the region.
Mr Lamb started work at the university in 2009 and taught geography and science education. The university has 3,500 students and is located in the city, which has about 12,000 inhabitants.
Mr Lamb a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of the Lamb old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla, Haiti, told me that he was 15 years old and Lamb, 20-year-old, when they met through mutual friends.
The shark, and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was funny, an older guy who tried for many years to teach the shark from Estonia to play the guitar.
He was quite the charmer in those days.
All the girls were putty, while he was there, told the now 40-year-old for the Sharks, who lives in a suburb of Jackson in Brandon.
Mr Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
Emergency call Lamb told me that he killed his wife, but their marriage is not a shred of evidence.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them over the river, the brick house in the desert.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband Shawn O Steen told me they broke up 15 years ago, but have remained friends. They are now 19-year-old daughter.
"He's very upset," O Steen, described her daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O Steen told me he hadn't met the Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Mr Lamb met Prentiss, when Lamb and Abigail were both performing there during the summer on the market three years ago.
Later, they played together with piss gigs.
O Steen told me that his daughter is doing and sing his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a number of online businesses.
The desert near his father's bar, The Jules P Room bartender and occasional entertainment Organizer Mike Shaffer says that he saw the Lamb and Prentiss September 5, last night, when Lamb had finished guitar solos and harmonica performance sparse audience.
But nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
Just goofing around and throwing shots off each other.
So they were both quite clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the freshman seminar program and was a specialist in Indians and colonial history, told the school's English teacher, Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied the Kansas Emporia State University and was the sister of his presidency, and the student government leader.
On Tuesday night in Cleveland Delta State campus held a candle, which was attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Holy Mass, during which the university choir sang songs to the Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Lesson continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to return," La Forge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported Mississippi from Cleveland.
Associated Press writer, Emily Wagner, Rudolph, Mississippi Greenville auction, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to the report.
Story has been corrected, it says that the police are now saying Lamb called Schmidt's 911 call after the shooting, and that although the Lamb was referring to Prentiss during a phone call from his wife, there is no evidence that they were married.

The UN leader says that the situation in Syria militarily resolved
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to the fact that Russia is more military aid to Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict "will not be solved militarily," and additional weapons only exacerbate the violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and to support non-discriminatory talks to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the five permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - Foreign ministers of the General Assembly during the week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the Council, the Syrian people, as well as regional powerhouses division "has made it impossible to resolve the situation."

8 support survey results showing that Donald Trump is serious about
Some people have tried to brand him as a wind delay.
Others like him just as a joke.
Part of the collapse of waiting.
While some Republicans have tried to ass Donald Donald Trump away support from the top of the polls, it is not (yet).
In 10 of the last 11 national survey, Donald Trump has been a double-digit lead in the 1960s, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means in terms of real estate where the King's appointment.
The election season is, of course, is in its infancy.
These results do not mean that Trump is likely to be the Republican nominee.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing its lead to the rise of Herman Cain, neither of which supported by any state nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
Other groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and economic organisation, the conservative Club for Growth, have pointed out, however, Trump's persistence and started to use the resources to topple him.
Following the recent support polling results suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's a popularity figures have done a U-turn.
Just before, when Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University support polls showed that only two out of 10 Republicans welcomed the king of real estate.
By mid-July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52%.
Currently, six out of ten Republican Donald Trump takes a positive way.
About three in ten say that they opposed.
These figures are correct, also the first pre-election states.
Quinn, of the university's doing support poll in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they are sympathetic to Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump would become the candidate.
(CNN / C poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "pleased" if Trump would be the candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be "shocked" if he becomes a candidate.
Only Ben Carson produces roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% of the "enthusiastic" vs. Trump's 40%).
Next, causing the most excitement?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "dissatisfied" or "shocked" if leaders from the popularity of Jeb Bush would become the nominee.
Trump's fiery nature isn't a problem for the majority of Republicans.
Although Donald Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombastic speeches and insults, Monday's ABC News / Washington Post poll, 52 per cent, according to the Republican side of the tilt of the voters at the national level, thinks that the real estate king is the president of fit.
Quinto, was held last week, according to the poll, the first organized the rally in the state of Iowa chapter is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think that Trump is a leader of the quality of the character.
ABC / Post poll shows that 44 per cent, however, thinks that his character fit to act as president, and nearly six out of ten believe that his character belong to the White House.
Republican primary voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think as commentators, they are of the opinion that Trump is a real option.
(CNN / C, according to the poll, four out of 10 had Donald Trump as the most likely option when they asked who most likely will be appointed to the Republican nomination.
Yet at the end of July, four out of 10 supported Jeb Bush.
The data release: Republican voters do not always have the brightest possible crystal ball.
Last term, this time was about four in 10 Republicans believe that Rick Perry is nominated as a candidate, and only 28% in favour of the final candidates, for Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters to Trump's campaign as a credible.
While the Republicans will settle to endorse another candidate, Trump has won almost every.
Some commentators have pointed out that a fragmented field probably has helped Trump's leadership, as the anti-Trump's popularity is divided among a number of other candidates for.
Monmouth University poll conducted by the beginning of September, however, showed that in the hypothetical race between Donald Trump and almost all the other Republican among the candidates, Trump gets majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly plain Fiore 13 points, Marco Rubio take 14 points, Walker 15 points, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and Rand Paul, John and Chris Christie for eight-way every 33 points.
He is tied for the points with Ted Cruz.
The only Trump winning candidate?
If they were to be pitted against, Ben Carson would win a businessman Donald Trump with an 18-point margin.
Barely a majority of Donald Trump's supporters have said that decision.
A new CBS / NOW: The poll Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters in favour of Donald Trump has decided who gets their vote.
The situation could change, of course, and no one can fully confident to say, never mind.
46% said that they could potentially change the acceptable candidate.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision, are two times more likely to be Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republican says that they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants as "rapists" campaign kick-off speech, immigration has been the focus of debate in the year 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombast drive Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and hurt the re-branding of companies.
Published on Monday, the new ABC / Post poll in six out of ten Republican says he agrees with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the centre of things, so too is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson's approval rating now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their status outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republican said Monday the ABC / Post poll that they prefer to choose an outside party politics than one who has experience in government.
They are also angry about the federal government.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register / Bloomberg survey of Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republican has frustrated Republicans in Congress: 54% are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "very angry."

Correa's debut in Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election

You will ask for the first of the six question shortly after noon, and probably as well as the media that Labour MPs are watching closely for his performance.
You have called for this weekly show "less theatre and more facts."
He has also said that could leave some opportunities to their colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test of Correa's leadership, after he was appointed to the shadow cabinet and the Confederation of Trade Unions, he spoke at the annual meeting on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour leader's decision to stand for the national anthem in silence during Tuesday's memorial service, which was held in the battle from Britain - the 75th anniversary of the air war, has attracted criticism from Conservative MPs and appeared on several front-page stuff.
But Correa's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
The Corsa's spokesman said he "respectfully standing quietly," and that he recognizes "the valor of the Royal Air Force of Britain's air war."
The Corsa's shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, said: "The BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he had invited the leader of the Labour Party to sing the national anthem, despite the fact that he thinks that the royal family should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow minister has denied being involved in the Cordoba province on the inside, citing differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Originally, less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says about the differences between the party's role in the European Union, as well as the government's relief roof are also "accumulated" within the Labour Party, following the appointment of Cordoba province.
You said at a meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions, the Labour Party to make change, which would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the government, the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, Smith said that the party was "very clear" about it, only that they oppose the government's plans to cap £26,000 for £23.
Cork from Libya will become the fifth leader of the Labour Party, which David Cameron has faced in the last decade, when he was leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics, and now says that he has "no mass" ideas like the Prime Minister, and received more than 30,000 proposal.
Islington North MP's metro region, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too the character and that he intends to abstain as well as a clever to sniping that Thornton, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
You have said that the government's economic shadow secretary Angela Eagle will deputise for him during Question Time, when you won't be attending - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
You have also suggested that other colleagues could sometimes give to speak, and he has said that he approached the President of the House of Commons, John Berman, who, on this issue.
When Cameron was in charge in 2005, he said that he wants to move away from the kind of political theater, which is often combined with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but he was later forced to admit failure.
Ever since they began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important indicator in evaluating the leader's judgement, his control of the House of Commons, as well as his position on other MPs, although critics have criticised the poll hours that they have become just a travesty, which calls for far-reaching reforms.

Metro cash to start a grass-roots campaign against the intrusion into Aldin
Metro cash trying to protect his business, Ga-Aldin attack in Southern and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metro cash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the IGA-market traders in the Southern and Western Australia before Aldin $700 million for the attack.
Aldi is preparing two distribution centres, as well as the opening of the first store early next year in the Southern and Western Australia, which is coming up to 120 trade, while the Mets for cash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen relations with local food brokers and build the IGA brand mainstream - and through social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show exhibition.
IGA of dealers and suppliers have jumped in, and all the brands such as Dungeon Hillsborough 'from the ice-cream manufacturer Simmo's IGA, offering a taste of the shops, and shop owners sell concessionary tickets to Australian football matches regular customers.
Metro's caching is expected to reveal more details about the defense strategy on 29 September, when this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler organises an annual investor day strategy.
A lot is at stake, as the Southern and Western Australia make up a total of almost 30 per cent of the Met's caching, Ga-shops in the area, and the profit margins are higher than the Mets in the eastern Länder caching the IGA network.
The Southern and Western Australian shopping visitors are notoriously parochial, IGA and the dealers will have a much bigger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and in Queensland: More than 30% in the south and west, 24% compared to 14% in the eastern states.
Analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi picks up about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first movement. Turnover from all players, but mostly independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kieron death estimates that the IGA the retailers may lose $360 million in annual sales and cash from the Mets could lose $250 million a year by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year in the south and west of 25 to 30 stores, which produces 500 and 600 million dollar turnover in these areas.
Food and food sales and the loss of the Met's high fixed cost base can pay for the Mets caching around 13 million dollars profit losses before interest and taxes, "Death said.
Meanwhile, Metro cash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly in the Alps and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan survey found that the IGA: All of the customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that the Met's caching food and food sales are down 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, so that its market share is falling year 2015 14% to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, a leading fund manager and founder of Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass told a business lunch in Melbourne that the Mets cash could very possibly "lost decade."
Metro cash has refused to publicly respond to Douglass's comments.
However, it is understood that the Met's caching executive had taken last week contacted Douglas.
IGA: Market share has fallen since 2010, 18% to 14%, and income from Metro's caching food and food business, which cares for about 1,200 products, Ga-dealer, have fallen by 43% after 2012. "This is about reducing the debt financing activities, when sales and margins are under pressure.
Wholesaler assert, however, and has invested more than $150 million on a weekly basis to calculate the prices of hundreds of products at the same level as Mr. Coles and Woolworth's, helping IGA retailers to renovate the shops by adding the faster growing fresh food, as well as bringing a better range of private labels on products.
The Met's chief executive, Ian Morris says that prices and improving stores have added to the attraction, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian tennis federation president Steve Healy supports your Than The Woman-acne
Your Than The bouclé Vlastimil deserves credit rather than criticism for their behavior
Your Than The bouclé Vlastimil has endured as a byproduct of the recent storm, which has been raging for his friend Nick Dicks around the legions. He deserves more credit than criticism of his own behavior, says Australian tennis federation president Steve Healy.
"The Special See" talented pair's younger Koch bouclé Vlastimil had unwittingly revealed a case where Dicks Agios annoyed Stan Wallis, it's Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly afterwards, in an elimination game in Cincinnati's chief judge had twice been hard to distinguish between facts and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, when Harrison said: "The hillside, Wade should have beat Dicks Agios, and I'm supposed to beat this kid."
Although The last thing Vlastimil was seen to break his bat after the cramp ruined his potential profits from Richard Gasperi, at the US Open, Healy has been The thing I staunch defender.
Right now the young man is competing in Glasgow Sam Grove's second place with two games with Bernard Tom Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
"I'm pretty firmly believe that your Thanh has just been dragged into their rowdy," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he loses because of a cramp in the US Open, but he isn't the first player who breaks his bat in frustration, and I feel the Thanh well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved extremely well, but also quite provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been a bit harshly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard, fits in with the team and so on, and he has never had a problem with the other players. "He's very well respected in the dressing room, he's practicing hard, is in good shape and is very calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged on its merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to lick, starting on Friday, according to the important games describing this as "a joint decision" for all the good solution, but still supports candidate were a return to the team's standard equipment.
"We want the team to be completely focused on the game and not everything to polemics Dicks [of]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen so quickly, like for example, Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all of the criticism, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of their actions, and I believe that it is best for the team and for him, if he spends some time away from the public eye to discuss these consequences.
Europe's immigration crisis: Hungary declared a state of emergency, closes borders, detaining immigrants
Hungary has declared a state of emergency and closed its borders with Serbia's southern against those who were trying to enter the country illegally, with the aim of stemming the flow of migrants into the country.
The border was followed by chaos, when hundreds of migrants gathered in the neutral zone, and the Serbian authorities reacted with outrage.
People who fled the violence in their own countries, have now been erected tents and settled for an indefinite period to the highway alone control posts between the two countries.
However, frustration grew.
Of the police helicopter above them immigrants, saying things like "Open the borders!" And yelling insults the Hungarian riot police.
Some people refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister has declared that it is "unacceptable" return of migrants in Hungary, when they arrive in Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
The matter must be discussed in the next few days with other countries and Brussels, "Ivica, c said in Prague.
Chaos at the border between Hungary and Serbia was born after 28: The nationality of the bloc failed in creating a common immigration policy in a confrontational meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed on the division of responsibility for 40,000 people applying for asylum, who now have taken over the Italian and Greek. Ministers spoke of the hopes of reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - about what the EU states to take 120,000 more refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded on Tuesday next week, an EU summit to discuss the continent's migration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put the hope that its neighbors or Brussels would work in the near future.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern region gave authorities greater powers to act in a crisis and made it possible that you can be closed and asylum lawsuits can be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szidon billion handed to said that now that the fence on the border with Serbia is ready, the country also plans to erect barbed-wire fence on part of its border with Romania, to stop the flood of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the barbed-wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and point of entry to the European Union for refugees, many of whom are escaping war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said, however, that most of the arrivals are economic refugees looking for a better life, and not those fleeing from war, who are entitled to protection - this view is in stark contrast to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define a crime or harm the company exceeds the 4-meter (13-foot) barbed-wire fence, which the government has built up against Serbia's southern border, as well as include longer prison sentences convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government declared a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists to the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear: Crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Parliament must still formally approve next week expected military positioning, but the Associated Press journalists on the border have seen for days already heavily armed military personnel and vehicles with a dog.
Mr Orban's homeland security adviser, an energy-Badia di said that authorities had taken up to 45 people in their attempts to cross the border, as well as 15 already drifted further into the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, have now been detained by the police, and they are accused of offences as defined under the new laws.
Authorities quickly fix the fence.
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning, including two of the seven seats in the Serbian crossing their arms after they were sent out with barbed wire-covered-wagon to one of these places.
The main border crossing near the Hungarian Roszkowski sake lay covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and the crowds were hard to squeeze inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands more were left outside.
A group of migrants, blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they are refusing to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
Election 2016: According to a national survey of Hillary Clinton's leadership to Bernie Sanders has narrowed side
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to double-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders pushes him.
Clinton supports now 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), and the second the Sanders supports 27% (up 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced he was leaving the president, according to age, but he's worth 15% of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the beginning of the pre-election, the majority of Democratic voters finds that it is still too early to say that they had decided to vote for anyone.
Clinton's supporters are standing behind their own choice, however, more than the other candidates for supporters.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among several groups last month's CBS News Poll - after a survey, and at the same time, Sanders has risen slightly.
Clinton has a strong lead among women and moderates, but his lead has narrowed.
His popularity among men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is just 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead is less than 50-year-olds among Democratic voters has disappeared, and he is now neck and neck with Sanders.
Clearly, however, Clinton leads among older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders double-digit figure among liberals, but now that Sanders will lead this group of five percentage points.
About half of the country's Democratic voters say that they support Clinton enthusiastically, if he becomes the party's candidate.
A quarter say they support him with reservations, and 15 percent would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent did not support him at all.
It is hardly surprising that the current Clinton supporters are very likely to be enthusiastic in his support.
Views are more mixed, those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter of the support him enthusiastically.
Where 48% of Democratic voters say they support Clinton enthusiastically, Republicans first man Donald Trump the same says fewer Republican voter (35%).
When asked about Clinton's supporters in an open question why they wanted him as a candidate, the most popular answer was that he has the right experience (16%), followed by the most popular answers were that now is the right time for the president in women (13%), and that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions as well as the possibility of being elected was also mentioned.
Because the vice president appears to be a possible presidential candidacy, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even though it is one-third disagree.
Democratic voters are asked who they would choose the second party's appointment, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half said that they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek the candidacy of the Democrats, Hilary Clinton led Sanders grows. If Biden goes along, leadership has 20 percentage points, but if he is opting out, the figure is 30.
55% of Democratic voters believes that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
This yardstick against Biden lags far behind, but the proportion of those who love him most votes, has grown.
When Democratic voters were asked what is the most important in a candidate, however, they raised their views ahead of the vote.
Last month, nor any Democratic candidate or potential candidate was not considered as a candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well in certain key issues among his party's voters.
Most likes Clinton, Sanders and Bill looking for honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden faring best trio of honesty, while the strength of the Clinton's leadership.
30% of Democratic voters say they like Clinton honest and trustworthy, which is two times more than Sanders (15%), while 27% said that they have no opinion of Sanders.
Democratic campaign, voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically agree.
When you look at all of these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters say that they have no opinion of Sanders.
Even though Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server when he was foreign minister raises more questions, the majority of Democratic voters are satisfied with his explanation regarding the issue and says that it affected their overall opinion of him.
It is different, however, when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, and only about one-third is satisfied.
The nation's divided opinion in March, shortly after it came to light.
The majority of Americans say that the e-mail controversy affected their opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent saying that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republican says that their opinions Clinton has changed for the worse.
Although Clinton's own party's voters consider him honest and trustworthy, he is still a problem among all registered voters, only 32 per cent to keep him honest and trustworthy, and that figure has dropped 8 percentage points from last month, as well as 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don't like Clinton honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not like Donald Trump as an honest and trustworthy.
And Clinton, however, is that Donald Trump is considered a good leaders.
Of the six candidates in the study of biology, Carson and Bush is considered to be the most honest.
Sanders is regarded as an honest, but many people have no opinion of him, just as Carson doesn't either.
The margin of error in a study involving 351 Democratic voters, is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News / New York Times poll
The two candidates gathered in the new poll, half of all votes cast, leaving others to fight instead of a footprint.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favour of Donald Trump, whose approval rating has risen from the previous, before last month's Fox News debate to the CBS poll, 23% to 27% in a poll published on Tuesday.
However, Carson has risen at the same time, soaring from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing a very different demographic groups, and Trump's ousting of higher education among Republican voters.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabees honey bee, and in Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are tied for third place at 6%.
The margin of error for this latest, in September, a survey of the 376 Republican voters in the sample is + / - 6 percent.
Last week, published in the most recent CNN / THE C poll showed Carson's rise in the polls: He has a 19% approval rating among Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him at 32%.
Also in the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll shows that Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
Carson's rise in popularity over the last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgeon in vain, even though Ms Carr apologized Trump questioning the faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday's campaign visit to Iowa.
Five frat members are accused of Baruch College, first-year student's death
Nearly two years after a student died in a fraternity hazing "ceremony in Pennsylvania in the Poconos Mountains region, a murder charge has been brought against five people.
The New York City-based Baruch College School of Pi Delta Psi fraternity's members were cruelly Chun "Michael" Deng attacked during the membership rites in September 2013, and then took their to take her to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say that Deng's eyes was tied up and his back was loaded more than 13-pound backpack full of sand, and then repeatedly tackled him to the ground, when he tried to walk across an icy field toward the target.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
Brotherhood members did not call 911 after Deng's faint, but allegedly waited for an hour before they brought her to the hospital, police say.
However, they had time to change clothes, Deng, search online for information about his symptoms, as well as contacting the fraternity's national president Andy to go asking for advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
"This is where members began to hide the ritual equipment and that's basically made the Brotherhood's welfare ahead of Michael Deng," Police Chief Wagner said.
Deng for not back to life, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report Deng received repeated blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have had to suffer the fraternity hazing, when every year at least one student has died as a result of this ever since 1970," Doug's, Deng, a lawyer representing the family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this is an important step for the authorities.
The Monroe County grand jury accepted it, that the first five members receive a third-degree murder charges
The 32 other Brotherhood members, including Meng, are also accused of violent hazing and criminal conspiracy.
"We don't want to just individuals." If there is something behind the organization, which accepted the situation, either formally or informally, they also must be held accountable, "Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the national fraternity defused the connections to the local branch.
This happens when the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates
Raising interest rates will be, and the emerging market rates fall, bond yields are rising and the economy falls into recession.
This we know.
What we don't know is how long this is going or how long it lasts.
The past doesn't give little help in terms of timing, particularly when it comes to the economy.
While the recession has lasted for the first withdrawal, sometimes after just 11 months, and sometimes it has gone as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US Federal Reserve lifting interest rates has been often, though not always, the determining factor in how the economy and the financial resources to respond.
Why the US Federal Reserve officials are so vigorously insisted that investors shouldn't focus on that, because it will start to raise interest rates, but rather to normalisation to go along the development cycle.
The equation is really a number of variables.
In the end, however, market participants will be able to see that all of the interest rates the fuss has been oversized.
"The Fed's first increase since the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as" the era of cheap money "to the end," said Capital Economics chief global affairs economist Julian Jessop message to customers.
Instead, we expect that the US interest rates gradually return to normal, though still low, the level is such a cataclysmic shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that it would have.
Below is an overview of how some areas of the economy will react based on past trends:
As the market has seen some of the last months, waiting for the lift interest rates can make an unstable situation.
When the increase becomes a reality, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It appears that the return on capital, have a tendency to stop 12-24 months after the first increase, which in turn may reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study, about what happens after the increase in the central bank.
More specifically, in the last 35 years, the markets are generally strong, rising by around 14% increase when approached, 250 days after that, the situation is fairly flat (average increase of 2.6%), and the normal mode is reached after 500 days, while the average return for six in the last cycle, 14.4% reported sleep latency Asset Management - the company's leading equity strategists Bob Doll in recent analysis, published in Barron's magazine.
Deutsche Bank says the impact on equities is usually clearer cycles increased at a later stage, when profits are starting to fall.
Regressions are part of economic life, but the interest withdrawals often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces a number of challenges, which have not previously been, and that can boost the recession.
This is especially gross domestic product, which will be the closest to the all-time lowest levels before the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank in 1950 after 118 lifting the annual nominal GDP has only twice been below 4.5%.
In the second quarter of 2015, although the figure was 3.6%, few believe it's going to stay, while the third quarter has advanced 1.5%, says the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Raising interest rates this fragile economic design mass can be risky, and raises the question: "Is this time different," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants are prepared for an increase in Bank throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the committee cannot accept the increase at this meeting, futures trading predicted only a 25% probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950 the increase all cycles have so far appeared to increase leverage super-cycles, where GDP has surpassed pre-recession peak very quickly after the recovery has begun," the report says.
By contrast, now under way has been exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst period of observation.
In asking the New York Federal Reserve is by far the longest waiting for the end of the last recession: The record has been 35 months, and now it is already underway in the 74th month.
Fixed yield has also been unstable market expectations of interest rates, and the model is reminiscent of some of the findings from the capital.
The main difference is that the central bank changed its line, its effects will be felt faster than the debt on the books in stock.
Bond yields direction looks like a floating immediately after the first cycle / mark-up for surgery.
At the end of the cycle race, bond yield falls immediately, "Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab - strategists believe that raising interest rates will cause longer and shorter term bond yields convergence, so as to compensate for the yield curve.
High-yield bonds are often better in a situation like this, even though "we are still cautious about the search for yield," said Schwab, a fixed income analyst Kathy Jones in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the markets are already adapted to the expectations of the central bank.
"The strength of the dollar and inflation expectations, in addition to the bill has a number of signs that the markets have adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more even, credit spreads have increased and instability has increased - all of these are typical of the market, where the central bank has tightened its guidelines.
Generally, companies whose business is located primarily in the United States, win, when interest rates are rising and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high levels of debt, are performing worse, when the dollar makes their products more expensive on world markets and their debt becomes more expensive than what they are funding.
"History shows that the" high-quality "shares, which are usually more lucrative in the aftermath of the first increase in three months," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Companies with a strong turnover, passed a small turnover companies in 1994, 1999 and 2004 after increases by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies that have a high return on capital and low-volatility stocks, performed better than lower-quality companies. (The former average was 4 percentage points) and the latter (3 percentage points).
The debt will be a big problem.
The companies, which have a lot of variable rate debt, are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside the market speculation, and consumers have the opportunity to benefit from the rising value of the dollar.
Savers will also be able to turn a profit with greater profits, even though experts disagree about how quickly the effects will be felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says:
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accused the channel "to popularise"
He argues that the separation of its commercial competitor is becoming more difficult

He also took a shot at the BBC Music Awards Awards gala, which was launched last December.
"Last year, started the BBC Music Awards seems to be just under a different name in one place - the BRIT Awards Gala.
So if you are trying to do something different, here are two examples that I remember directly, when in fact only duplicate something which is already on the market can be found, "Bingham said.
The BBC's director-general denied the charges, claiming that the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and sharing of information to citizens.
Radio 3 to teach things that classical music, what I can't learn anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music for the guerrillas is actually a first-class.
"Also, I think it is really important that Radio 3 has committed to find new music and to commission new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 "s chief, Alan Davey, argued that the channel has to do more work than in the past to reach the public, because the British people know less about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only part of the BBC's offer, which was criticised by commercial competitors are stepping on the toes of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee during the hearing.
The conservative Tory MP Damian Collins criticised The Voice, you know, music competition, which the BBC bought from a Dutch production company Talpa Media, according to estimates from 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this show is often discussed, because it is not the original and it's not exactly original?
Lord Hall claimed that the BBC is C1-channel program, in which the star judges operate Paloma Faith and Boy George, has produced "very BBC-style."
He added that he wants "to find success in the production company's own in-house," the next time it will begin a series of entertainment.
He did not, however, refused to stop future production of The Voice, or to determine that the licence payers "money would be used in other forms of entertainment.

He explained that three years ago, online sales grew stronger, when buyers began to use their mobile phones to shop.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as on the couch.

Britons are increasingly using auxiliary men favors, Veronique Laury says
In Eastern Europe, the number of men entering the profession is behind the rise
Aimed at professionals as a result I got a fix-shops opened 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q stores across the country

Britons told to give up from hammers and paint my brushes his gesture and prefer to hire the skilled Eastern European workers to do home renovations

Brits will hire more and more men to help do-it-yourself work in their homes, says B & Q, the company behind the boss.
Home owning a home-improvement store chain Kingfisher's new chief executive Veronique Laury said that behind the popularity is from Eastern Europe or the number of working men, and the fact that they are offering their services for a song.
This leads to the Kingfisher plans to open 200 new jobs for men, I got a fix-trade and the closure of 60 B & Q stores.
Laury said he wants more women to work in B & Q stores, because eight out of ten from the store to buy is made by the fairer sex.
Nowadays, most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the population must be taken into account: Today is more of a one-woman economies, which are more home renovations than before.

Three ace, the government decided to resort to the pressing legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects have been pretty quickly.
Sack and other confederations of employees, a sharp mind began to force right now, and as a result, the country stands on Friday because of extensive mental expression of workers.
For many, the time then also stands to reason.
Asked whether the strike, when doing badly anyway.
Even set up a Resistance.
Online, more than 50,000 people have already been to announce that he will not participate in the protest, but goes to work.
In the good old time such a consensus would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet, where protest, but openly declared to be a scab, then it would have been a political suicide.
Billion-dollar membered unions some ten thousand people protest is not a high priestess, but it gives pause for thought.
Role of the trade union movement is no longer so obvious as yet about 20 years ago.
Not everyone feel ownership of the movement's goals, values have changed.
The trade union movement's activities from the point of view of the government's drastic solutions may also see a direct as a godsend.
When things are for years have shown taxiing on its own, so now we're getting somewhere in the defense of worker's rights, clearly and properly.
Thus, the government may want to maybe stronger union movement's role, while trade union membership is seen in the past, perhaps more necessary.
No matter what activities are organisations, so it's nonsense that Friday's demonstration does somehow halt the Finnish.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has already fallen 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to fall, and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things to make everyone's head.

The university has a total budget of around 85 million euros, so the savings target is 10% of the entire budget.
The massive cuts to education and research, as well as the cumulative reduction in corporate funding of our universities is very important, "says Principal Anneli Pauli university bulletin.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in funding now appears in the new proportions.
Negotiations with the confidence of men will be launched next week on Tuesday, and they last six weeks required by state law.
YLE: Luck Rebus wants to Finnish railways
Cheap bus company An ibn 'owner, British general Sir Brian Sousa, says that the company is also aiming for rail in Finland.
I am very interested to go to the Finnish rail.
Stagecoach-my company is one of Britain's biggest rail companies, Mr Slater says.
Rail is expected to gradually open up to competition.
The first is the metropolitan commuter rail in 2017-2018.
Transport will be followed by a long-distance traffic.
Mr Slater says he had already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to the Department of Transportation is considered lucky, I welcome the Iberians' plans.
Other international companies with an interest in rail transport has announced at least Transdev (former Veolia), which is also a bus and rail traffic in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
The US Federal Reserve has to make decisions on rates
The rest of the world will be watching from the sidelines, when the Federal Reserve will meet for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision as to whether they will raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists, for a little more than half of those who still believed the central bank last week to raise interest rates, now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and kept interest rates at the current 0-0.25 per cent level.
This is a historic event, because, when the central bank cut interest rates to zero, is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which the central bank has the opportunity to get away from the zero level and begin to normalise interest rates, "said Angel, SP, Peterson Institute for International Economics Economic Institute senior fellow.
The US economy has done relatively well, and the recovery has brought balance sheets, trillions of dollars and created a little bit of inflation.
Central bank cannot ignore the less-rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be prepared to take the load, but the indications are they also believe that the odds are against the increase.
Decision will be made public on Thursday at 8: 00 (CET).
Delta State University shooter left a message of apology
After shooting dead his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before he shot his colleague later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note which said he was "disappointed" the first murder and hoped "that could take it back," the authorities said on Tuesday.
Mississippi's desert, the police told me that the Delta State University geography and social sciences teacher Lamb called 911 at about 10: 00 in the morning
On Monday, and told me that he has shot and killed someone.
Mr Lamb told the defendant that the police need to send officers to his home.
He said, "that he killed his wife last night," and also mentioned that the house is "cute dog" who "doesn't bother anybody," but will probably be shocked.
Police said a player of this name, but he didn't say it.
Mr Lamb gave no explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, they found a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss's body as well as a 45-year-old Lamb manuscript message, which read: "I'm so sorry I wish I could take it back.
I loved her, and she was the only person who has ever loved me. "
After writing a message Lamb drove nearly 500 mile Delta State, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt, before eventually killing himself late on Monday when police surrounded him.
University William La Forge said that between Lamb and Schmidt, for her to know there was no contradiction, but that "clearly Lamb had something in mind."
Authorities said Tuesday that, despite the allegations published on Monday, according to which Lamb would have thought Prentiss was in relation to Schmidt, did not have "any information or evidence" of any "triangle drama."
Shawn O Steen told me that he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as "a good person."
A couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter, who is "shocked."
O Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were "simply the best of friends."
Linda Wednesday, according to Knowles Prentiss worked at home online, according to the Sun Herald Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been involved with Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police told Lamb called relatives at some point Monday to tell them that "he doesn't go to jail."
When police caught up with Lamb Highway 1 near Green vaudevillian later that same evening, Lamb stopped his car off the road, left it there and ran into the woods, where he shot himself in the head.
Mr Lamb, the educationalist from Delta State starters in the spring of 2015, says the university's website on the CV.
The stars, who lost their charm
Actress (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001, he was sick with leukemia, and in 2009, his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumour has it that he has also had drug problems, and in 2008, he was arrested for drug possession.
All this is really taking its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw received a double fracture in the right leg of Manchester United lose PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Even though the defender was left in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw would play again this season.
Injured Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle on 15 minutes after a 20-year-old Shaw was plunged in PSV's territory.
He was nine minutes on the field and we had to give him oxygen before taking to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture of the leg, and he is now in the hospital."
He will be transferred to maybe tomorrow or the day after that, and then cut in Manchester.
This is awful. Boy coming to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from the difficulties and then play brilliantly, and now this happens.
When I was in the locker room, he had a gas mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but the double fracture will take at least six months, and he's playing in the group stage.
I hope that he gets to play this season.
Moreno was lucky, or when he received a red card and a penalty shot.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli didn't punished the Mexican players.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officials and made a mistake.
You can judge the situation, when I say that it became a penalty and a red card.
It was a really bad two-leg tackle.
Shaw just tweeted: "Thank you for all your messages, words can't describe how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I'll come back stronger."
Topic: Manchester United suffer from Luke Shaw's case and loses PSV:
An English defender has a further incentive for recovery in next June's European Championship in France.
PSV: Coach Phillip Cox cu said: "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out of this type of injury, everyone is very sad.
Our players have never intended to hurt opponents.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for the Mexican team, Van arsenal against Holland in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno will take this seriously, because the aim is not to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it's a bad thing," said Coyle cu.
I didn't see in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball, which was going in a different direction, so it seemed like he [Moreno] would have touched it, but I haven't seen Luke tackles.
Moreno said SBS6: "I know what it feels like, I know how difficult this kind of thing can be.
I feel terrible because of this, I'm so sorry. "
PSV: Andrés Guardado also was taken to the hospital after Chris Smalls's challenge to him.
I think David Cameron knows the Lorax this better?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves something book, doesn't last long, though, before it can learn almost by heart.
So, if you're David Cameron.
When the holiday-time childcare service asked the Prime Minister for his favourite children's book, he chose the Dr. Seuss book The Lorax, published in 1971, environmental story.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes Super Camps-message published on the company's website and to continue: "Funny, touching, creative and contains a powerful message. I enjoyed reading this book to my kids, because it always seems to find a photo or message, which we haven't seen before."
All of this is true, but the next song, which presumably Cameron describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which the relatively short to fill the original text was added new characters and details.
"The walls in the town of Thneedville, where all of nature is gone, and even the air is a commodity, Ted-boy wishes to win the girl of his dreams by filling the heart over Audrey's desire to see a real tree," the text says, and describes the love story, which died in 1991, Dr. Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geist, didn't write.
If this is not yet enough suspicious, Cameron's text sounds in places like that would be taken from the Internet Movie Database - found on the website of the Lorax movie plot summary, which begins: "The walls in the town of Thneedville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, Ted-boy hopes of winning dreams Audrey-girl at heart."
Given that Cameron has publicly active older, it seems unlikely that he would be so familiar with the plot of the book, that's a young, unnamed boy hears how the local wildlife has been destroyed by greedy, trees into Thneeds hacking and weaving the Once-ler, regardless of the name of a short story, with a mustache thing from Lorraine, who "speaks for the trees."
This relatively invisible PR task has probably been outsourced to his aide, who apparently never read the book 20 times in a row for the child.
Prime Minister's spokesman said that the text will become Cameron's constituency office.
Super Camps confirmed that the text was Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at the moment.
Adam's path was clearly in danger of being sidelined the England team, but it was still a tough place
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a hard task, but when you see what kind of team England has opted for a tour, I don't think that the last 3-0 series defeat is likely to recur.
I would not rule out a foreign profits.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but it's good for the night and the team's mindset is strong: They have no scars in 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moe Ali develops around their feeding and Adil Rashid is a choice, although it is unknown at this level.
Topic: Adam Lyons Street fell out of the England cricket team, he'll be replaced by Alex The Skies
The decision to leave Adam's youth team is understandably difficult to analyse for me, because I'm his main coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against the aggressors in the challenging conditions, and simple, but the harsh truth is that test cricket players judged on the basis of their income.
Joe Root's choice, for example, there was no uncertainty before a newsletter, because, as I've said before, the players are the best choice.
About 100 basis points more, and the team's season could go on, but he was personally responsible for their own destiny.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance to get in your way.
The England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyon's attitude, even when he's not performed quite as well as it could have, and it doesn't surprise me. "She is first and foremost a team player.
It's difficult to answer the question of how long hitter makes a mark-up.
"Lyon was elected seven times the national team, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton, was selected.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and in the guest.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Peat's first to the Caribbean, when she was on top form, but it's a missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex "Hale comes along, and there's a hitter, which I appreciate.
There's a cricket it is something that we in Yorkshire we saw early this season, when he scored 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
At the very least, he must be given the same opportunity as others before him, but this of course depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea has been tossed around in the batter's box open alongside Cook, when the airport would bring an extra pitcher, but to keep four quick, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why the batter could hit there, and this is left-handed, has already shown himself to be a cricketer.
Moe doesn't necessarily done up in his home county of Worcestershire Hertfordshire, but he has them three and there isn't much difference.
The old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in the first grid fell, before he joined the autopsy in 2001.
He made the first three hundred points and not look back.
Zafar Ansari's deputy, pitching for the team, and, after a bit of what I've been in contact with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his non-unvarnished statistics - batting average, 31, 35 with the ball - and I think that it's a gamble, but there are not too many pitchers and voters opted for the young.
He'll learn a lot of this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to be a few tough attachment on the side of the coach.
Sri Lankan hitter Matt HeLa, from both the appointment of consultant games may prove to be a stroke of genius.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and will bring a huge amount of experience, because he has done everything in all situations and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes with the white ball games, and brings both energy and ruthless a glimpse.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it be playing or coaching, and he has the same exploitable brains than Mao under the hem.
Sometimes the new voices in the locker room can refresh the team, even though their message was the same as before.
Collin's team guys in Durham, Ben Stokes, resting in the one-day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this, at least.
Although not everyone would agree, the coaches and chose not do schedules.
And we have to remember that, just like the players, their job depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
Britain's departure from the EU (Break Rexes) support can take victory, if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-hearted re-negotiating strategies to keep Britain in the EU are becoming increasingly larger problems, disregarding even heartfelt Jeremy "Is that a yes or no?" The choice of Correa's leadership of the Labour Party or the Confederation of Trade Unions of anger for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners, too, have their own province of Cordoba and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomatic friend recently explained that because the EU is so deep in the various crises, all of which are not the fault of its own, some Member States are tired of British self-centred agenda, which is full of concessions that cause controversy and disruptive changes to the contract, which for the most part, these countries do not want.
At the annual meeting in Brighton trade union confederation decided that wouldn't want them, if they are eroding the social protection.
We could even call it the Dave and George's fiesta clear agenda '.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer summits are late or in foreign capitals of the bilateral meetings, taking a picture of himself in front of the famous local monument either local eye to do with or without him, and then come home, saying that the supporters of Mitt Romney's reforms.
It's all about me.
A mate of mine, who wants to be outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with the French," said Berlin - suggests that certain capitals most short-sighted ministers and officials have now reached a point where they don't care about us, and then we leave.
Germany's conservative and moderate in Chancellor Angela Merkel's ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes up in the same way that was too long to stay Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand and Kohl (14) to (16).
France's François Hollande has faced re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a force out.
Poland may soon be a nationalist right-wing government, Spain's left-wing.
It's hard to see them through the self-effacing fiesta, on behalf of the British people, when they would be better off putting their energy to resist Scotland leaving the UK - they don't want that either similar own separatist trends.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers can even contemplate deliberately making pointless comments, the Scottish National Party's style of Great Britain during the year 2017 referendum campaign to accelerate the process of Bremen-Rexes.
"Re-negotiation was setup" and "re-negotiations didn't have any significance for Britain."
The Europeans have bitter experience how ravenous Fleet Street newspapers can be and how the EU-sceptical press exclusive the Lords are, what they weren't Tony Benn inspired during the 1975 referendum, which began in 1973, received a confirmation of our membership of the ratio of 2: 1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunists Cross, who made a name for himself by writing "EU straight bananas" during his time as a correspondent in Brussels in the early nineties.
Ed Miliband was perhaps a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They belonged to a diverse array of taxes guesthouse via Strangers, hacking the phones of foreigners as well as individuals, whose registered office is nominally elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought of them just the same, but I realized that if you're cooped up in bed with a gorilla, bananas must be abandoned due to distraction, unless you want to be the gorilla on the lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was-more than Blair himself, as far as Cameron's re-negotiating trick. R Bailey had agreed on the principle of the EU constitution rejected by French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press doesn't give him that either never forgive.
But nice Jeremy you, who patted me kindly on the Westminster parliament house on Monday (I told him that he has no more time to waste on me), appears to be in danger of re-embrace the 1980s Neil Kinnock is being boycotted Murdoch "strategy, which was a mistake, and then that now.
Even though it may take some time, however, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to communicate with the media, not me, but, without a doubt, Andrew Marr, the BBC sofa you left on Sunday.
The Corsa's official status in Europe is, to put it politely, evolving.
He says that he would want us to remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most of the people of the UK Independence Party, UKIP and war paint-enthusiasts, as well as the Conservative Party's most fierce nationalists outside can certainly stand behind this opinion.
"Hilary Benn, but not Benn fan," Benn said on the radio, and I saw that on TV this week, when his inner his Boy Scout troop had wanted to admit that the selection of Cork's rugged appoint John McDonnell as shadow finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the seventies, when his old man was on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues in government without having to go so far, however, that the government would lose the case.
Hilary strained, they were more attractive.
But for the battle to stay involved in the "anywhere" - Benn's phrase - wasn't that what McDonnell said, and by all accounts, what you told me the main camps and elected representatives in a private meeting on Monday evening.
No matter how it is non-hierarchical, emotional and personal image that you want to convey (remember that he even touched me), communications discipline is important 24-hour TV era, and especially the social media vortex, which is a breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it's only fair to give Cameron free tickets to Europe by allowing her to keep Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins, at least thinks so.
But McDonnell's office and her primary circles about EU membership (and, therefore, in line with their spiritual Benn-regulated economies and anti-capitalist pasts) is no longer just about abstruse debate on such left-wing dissidents, whom the narcissism of small differences is the central dogma in doctrinal squabbling.
What will be his ambivalent relationship with his own NATO (Tom Watson is convinced... that Corby is campaigning to get), foreign diplomats have to just try to explain it to his superiors.
Why the Paris or Berlin should spend political capital (they, too, are sceptical voters) concessions for Britain, when it can be completely pointless?
The United States has been somewhat disappointed by the poor performance of the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I noted in Monday's British Influence Security Forum Security Forum at center ice.
Experts have criticised the Public Health England electronic cigarette assessment
Investigators have said that the state-funded agency's claim that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional, began meeting with 12 people, some of them had links to the tobacco industry.
The British Medical Journal (BMJ), the experts write joined Lancey, was criticized by Public Health England (E) evidence used in electronic cigarettes.
"They released this" milestone "report last month, describing it as" a comprehensive review of the evidence. "
However, many scientists have questioned the sustainability of the data and pointed to the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
Publication of the medical journal Lancet published an editorial last month, which attacked the PHY E: The main conclusion of the "exceptionally little shaky on the bottom.
The other two, MJ: The author of the scientists have pondered whether the allegations were "built on a rock or sand."
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine School, Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health and the University of Liverpool, professor of clinical epidemiology, Simon Cowell, saying: "The main principle of public health is that policies need to establish a proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expect that E's claim "the current best estimates that electronic cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes," is based on a detailed assessment of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, it will be one of the 12 people for an appointment, which was developed for multi-criteria decision analysis model (CDA) synthesise their handicaps, which combines a variety of nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting summed up their research.
McKee and Howell says that one of the conference sponsors was a company named live Euro Swiss Health, whose chief executive is told in the past received funding from the battle of the American Tobacco company for an independent investigation.
He also supported the bat: In the public health authority sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people in the meeting, announced that it has received funding from the manufacturer of electric cigarette, but no funding for it, which he is said to have received the earlier tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
Don't tell the selection panel members, but the panel is one of several well-known electronic cigarette supporters, some of whom are also in the study received funding.
Others who were there are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
Tags have also attended E, director of tobacco.
Study produced by the group "significantly," admits that there is a lack of "undisputed evidence about the harm to the majority of products and most of the criteria," McKee and Howell writes.
None of these links or limitations, however, did not mention PHY E's report.
McKee and Howell says is parsed E's assertions that "so far there's no evidence that the electronic cigarette works as a route to burn children or non-smokers" would be premature.
"The director of health and wellbeing, Professor Kevin Fenton says that, in the BMJ allegations have been answered in the past.
He says: "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Half of their life who smoke die as a result of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we have to continue the long-term effects.
"They have a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence looks like and what it doesn't show, especially when compared to the relative risks of tobacco is so much lack of public awareness.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related disease and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - in other words, even if the electronic cigarettes are not risk-free, they are only a fraction of the traditional cigarette disadvantages - fulfilling a national responsibility.
The BBC should give up on EastEnders, says former director of Channel 4
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial rivals "would give anything" hits such as, for example, from Albert Square - on the streets of our Lives.
Johnson said that the licence fee should be used only to make programmes that other British broadcasters are not doing.
He criticised the BBC for the fact that it puts the public service programmes which are likely to have a smaller audience, dealing with difficult times broadcast competitors' most watched programs and those channels, as presented by the BBC.
After that, when the BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the company's willingness to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he arrived at Channel 4 in the past six years to establish a relationship with the BBC, to no avail.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC to produce and broadcast, which would be clearly non-subsidized competitors," Johnson said of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its investigation, the BBC's future.
If the licence fee is maintained - and I am not sure that it would be this message to or in the long term, it's a good idea - it should at least limit its production programmes such that no one else can do that.
The most important is sent on Voice in prime time, because its future is to gather as much support as possible.
The idea that no one else seems to show, it is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should fund the programs, which also could be funded without government subsidies.
The Voice is one of those and EastEnders, admittedly, were inside the house.
Frankly, the other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand how it is about the public service broadcast.
I don't think it would undermine the BBC at all. "
Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010 led to a serial entrepreneur, Johnson said that the BBC is guilty of audience volumes of hunting "because of the goals of the people who work there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He made a comment about the BBC's most popular series are reminiscent of the former Sky's leader Tony Ball comments. He used in the 2003 Mac Taggart-lecture in Edinburgh, to suggest that the BBC would sell series such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller audience for public service programmes "go on C4, which often cannot be measured by the number of viewers, but the BBC, thereby fulfilling their responsibilities and can then licence fee revenue of £4 billion in defence of hypocrisy, saying that" of course, we do all these unknown programs that no one "look."
They put them broadcasting scene in which no one has ever come to see them.
The licence fee for Johnson said: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system there, who get the most value for money.
Of course you all think, we all think that the £150 a year makes a lot of money, but I don't know whether it's true, those people for whom £150 is a lot of money, because they don't use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elton, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its Reid's early to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said that only a small part of the BBC's output is now classified as a school - he said he figures to be 1% of the TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and that it should take a leaf from the Australian and Canadian Broadcasting and change the mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
When it comes to questions of the partnership, Elsie, said that the BBC should concentrate more on the ms-events such as concerts, which he says will be shown on television, just a few, and an alliance with commercial broadcasters, so that these would all be accessible online.
"Sonic genetics" allows the brain cells that control using sound waves
The video shows how roundworms changing direction as soon as the voice of the impulse hits them.
Scientists have increased the worms, which is genetically modified neural systems, so that they can manipulate the sound wave bursts.
Tiny roundworms changing direction as soon as they voice-impulse, which is too high for human ears.
Impulses works by connecting on genetically modified commercial neurons with ultrasonic waves react to the membrane channels.
Topic: Scientists read and write about brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms will show a new, sound genetics two designated, the method that ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from the outside of the body.
In La Jolla, California-based Salk Institute researcher, leading to a path of memory, "Cho told The Guardian, that the method could one day replace the deep brain stimulation, it is an invasive procedure, in which the human brain into electrical impulses for Parkinson's disease.
Roundworms do not normally react to an ultrasound, but my sub-cho, found that when they are surrounded by a liquid, which is microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles confirmed the ultrasound waves, which then pass through the worms inside.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves will affect the TRP-4-ion channels, structures, which have some of the worms in the cell membrane.
The sound waves are these ion channels to open up and activate the adherent cells, says research published in Nature Communications, the report said.
In order to prepare the ultrasound steered threadworms, my bottom genetically modified worms so that part of their business is the nerve cells TRP-4-ion channels.
When my bottom Cho used ultrasound to engineered worms, micro-bubbles confirmed the sound waves and cared about those worms, where they formed a business link on neurons.
Method has some of the same features as the opto, terrorism, pioneering in the tool, which gives scientists a chance to connect nerve cells on and off using light, impulses.
My bottom Cho, however, says that the use of a probe may have some advantages compared to opto-genetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent to the optical fiber along the desired position inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can travel through tissue unhindered, so they can be transmitted to the brain from the skull.
"We believe that the gene therapy and the therapeutic use of the virus could be exposed to the possibility of human neurons momentarily to react to the ultrasonic signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting," Cho said in my area.
Other application targets could focus on the muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The ads may be British arms sales to shame
Look at Amnesty International's anti-arms trade fair video.
Terrifying killer machines!
Ankles scathing leghold traps!
Cluster bombs!
As well as electronic stun batons, causing excruciating pain, but leave no trace.
Happy sound and image comics language leave no doubt that this is the world's largest arms fairs ad is sharp parody, which Amnesty International was to highlight the British government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes the Defence and Security Equipment International at London's Excel Centre in the dock area at the party.
Topic: The NO arms fairs: Authoritarian regimes will arrive in London.
A separate campaign has also prompted the bus stops and metro trains turned up many of the posters, which will require further consultation.
"An important announcement, traveling the DLR route 15 to 18 September?" One asked, using the London Underground font and brand, the DLR will track changes in the image.
In September, this bunch of arms dealers arrives at the DLR route... Customers will be asked to help in stopping arms fairs.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose work was on display at a Bangkok Autumn Discovery Museum of Cruelty el Designs... Museum (Museum of brutal plans).
Collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread the posters all over London, using the "Ad Space Hack Pack see" packages. "It is a six-pound pack hexagon keys, which, according to the" one-third of the entire planet has access to the bus advertising space. "
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized posters "vandalism."
One of the Special Patrol Group - the slide of parody ads.
Cruz el Designs... - the curator and a professor at the University of Essex, according to Gavin Grinch's artists are questioning more and want to take the political work outside the gallery audiences.
A lot of artists have begun to work with activists from the opposition in the chest when they have realised that they have to go to the outside world, if they want their art that affects society.
Another anti-arms trade-poster greets commuters on the subway.
The video has been viewed Amnesty via Facebook in the last 24 hours, more than 100,000 times. It created for free advertising agency The CCP, and also a graphic designer and background commentator worked for free.
CCP, the creative director Matt Lee Pettit, found that the arms fairs not advertised at all - and also the calendar - it was an empty box - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign, which they are trying to avoid."
They toyed with the idea of the more realistic of murky corporate ad, but "was stopped listening to highlight things with bright colors and animation to be."
"They have done a fantastic job in helping us to raise questions about the fair sold illegal torture equipment," Amnesty International's Tom Davies says.
Now the UK government needs to take action and make sure that the instruments of torture are not sold illegally in her own home nearby.
Perhaps the most creative art fairs in arms - comes from the inside, when exhibitors make peddling fantastically embellish products.
Saab has revealed in a press release that it had placed an order in the US army "shoulder-fired way 4 CS RS:."
"This is a unique tube on the tip of the battle, which centers on the excellent effects behind armour inside the target."
No matter what it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules of student living in a dorm
It's been 11 years since the ignorant when I was 19 I moved student dorm. Then I believed yet Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember my irritation with people forced smiles - and numerous, lengthy appeals.
A large part of my learning can be summed up in eight simple rule.
Moving to a halfway house can be anything from the nerves of the fair quite frightening.
It is tempting to babble at: Tell us where you're from, did you like a year and where, what do you think of Cork from Libya, and why "seriously don't love or hate Marmite because really it's just yeast extract ha ha ha to find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And to help other people - ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you find those people that you love so much, and those who don't want to talk about, even if your lashes were on fire and they would share the fire extinguishers.
Give people the space.
People often change rooms for receptions, and went to the movies of the NATO parliamentary assembly and pieces of entertainment places, but they are also places where people dress up and corrective underwear.
Topic: Don't even think about going to start college when you're in a relationship
The University is a tough place for an introvert.
Your bedroom should be a place to rest, but many houses consists of a culture of wandering from room to room, which is a friendly, social and cause lifelong friendships.
It could mean the hell to someone who is trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture does not give you permission to say "I love you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now that I can collect back the energy spent in my conversations with you."
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socialism - and perhaps send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
Of knocking when it came to the speech: Knock.
One type of student dorm room was of the opinion that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw some pretty heavy stuff.
Make friends through the baking.
When you start university baking trend at peak season, knocking on people's doors to chocolate with a plate and the presentation of himself seems somewhat less weird, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I made you something, now smile when I ask personal questions" 50-926.
The self-serving delicacies is a great way to make friends.
Your pension payment will talk, and it may be that they will combine your tastebuds for a surprise.
This of course depends on it, you can bake.
Badly mixed flour-sugar-fat blobs are likely to make people just pretend to be asleep when you knock on my door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, someone taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you take just one drop of milk for your tea?
Ask and check the milk from the owner.
It is quite possible that they give you permission, although the boiling inside.
If someone steals your thing, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to be more grown-up than my dorm mate, who mixed up his milk detergent to punish those who stole it.
He is now in prison.
You won't get any noise so that people don't get to sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like the proverbial pot calling the kettle black land mass.
A girl in my hallway asked his neighbour, could they call drum and bass - his music so loud, because it was three o'clock in the morning and he had an exam in the morning.
The answer was the volume.
When they finally quieted down at five o'clock in the morning, she kindly gave them to sleep two hours before putting his own music gently, locked the door and left the three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic, if your future were to move in the same dorm with you?
Or, conversely, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward, if you'd like a dorm, your future spouse, your team together, you would resign, and after that you could see him every day, and possibly lose all common friend to him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot housing partner is definitely not your future, you could even try to talk some sense into sub-dressed.
It went down in an instant when you realize that someone has left the keys to lock in her room, the limit of pranks and bullying is thinner than it appears.
A good prank is funny, but it is reversible in an instant.
You can give a useful and entertaining lesson about safety by hiding something - but don't ever mess with someone in the room, toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which is then put in the freezer - but don't pay their property blue sticker on the ceiling more than twice.
Foreign student lodgings racist attack struck the - reception centre planned house was graffiti in Salon
Foreign students at her lodgings was made on Saturday morning racist attack struck the North Karelia.
Unlike in the past, the police told me, there is no accommodation for asylum seekers in the minors, but even more foreign students who were in the sleeping quarters, the crystal of the Protestant popular college teacher Heidi Koivumäki says.
Popular college accommodation windows and walls were daubed racist symbols, such as the best, and one of the accommodation had been thrown through the window of a metal object, tells police in eastern Finland.

Popular College has been accommodated people from 12 different nationalities.
They are already in Finland for a while, as well as students at the newly-arrived asylum seekers minors.
Everyone involved in the building is a-statuses.
Part of the adults enrolled in primary school, part of a vocational education and part of studying English, "says Koivumäki.
A-status is the so-called permanent residence permits, which can be granted for a period of four years in Finland for quite some time for a foreigner.
The eastern Finnish police are investigating the attack as an act of vandalism and breach of the peace at home.
Think a bit about what happened to the students held a press conference on Monday, which was also present the necessary interpreters.
No, there is no panic, and no one wanted to leave.
There have been a dozen years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens, "Koivumäki says.
It's thought that the mess has been cleaned up the walls to get out.
Factors are suspected of having had at least three men and they were on the move in a cream-coloured car.
I think that this is a youth on a weekend evening whim, when this issue has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that, "Koivumäki says.
Also in the Salon defaced the hospital, which has been designed as a reception centre.
Incident occurred last week.
Told MTV on its website on Tuesday evening.
The hospital was a swastika drawn on the wall and written in English, "You are not welcome."

State to abolish the Y-train livestock below - passengers are upset, "completely idiotic."
Helsinki Raseborg yelled less than a Y-train stops from passing in March.
Incensed by the news that the train was starting the night shift emerging passengers at Helsinki's main railway station.
Especially if it hits you on the shoulder, said resident of the municipality of Torbjörn Bengtsson Ström.
Absolutely idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and working in need of a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be caught up with anything other than the political will - or lack of it.
Bengtsson Ström says Spitzer V said in the video interview, even though the tractor to the capital.
Also in the rest of the Uusimaa train changes happen.
On the mainline pass through the H and R trains connecting the new R-line.
A bite station at the end of the lake and Sweetheart Castle Rock in fall out of use.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR announced Tuesday, details how a ministry to buy rail traffic in the next contract period.
The term of this agreement will change at the turn of the year and to shut down the routes throughout the country.
In the autumn to finalise a new four-year contract will see Monetary Affairs.
The Scout Siuntio Sjöström Bengtsson, believes that the government orchestrated the daisy cutter is short-sighted.
Making the same mistakes, what has been done in the past and repeated them in a very systematic way.
Then comes on top of remorse.
Y-trains also use other than the military, and the people of the blessed ones, because it's fast and bypass several stations.
His students as Anne Perry was booked on a train away from the urban area of the grim fate.
"It is a shame for those who have to plan their journey again," he said, when pain Y-train.
There is little relief.
Beach on the track seems to be becoming the new rail link, which replaces the Y-train traffic in the Helsinki region (HSL) in the region, which takes the papal moor.
This will bring more costs HSL: Basically in the region's municipalities and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to figure out the various options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices," said HSL, CEO of Suvi, like the peninsula.
The cost is still impossible to assess accurately.
The skin on a promontory says that the number of passengers using HSL has paid for Y-train about million a year, the ministry of course much more than this.
The main track, R-line pass two stations.
Instead, the material in the cave and paired with a female in the rock train double shifts.
The whole country will stop a total of 28 and a small role in a number of routes.
The Ministry will no longer buy rail transport route from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
Pieksämäki-Joensuu route shortened route Pieksämäki-theft.
Train shifts reduced routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Cattle, Kouvola-Eagle docks and Kajaani-Oulu.
The abolition of the shifts are made more than half a million journeys a year, while a total of transport ministry buying trips around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring the state at 12.3 million in annual savings.
The value of the contract is approximately 27.5 million euros per year.
Sixten The Beckman wrote a chapter in the Capital, the timeliness of this book: "Marx should delve into."
The global crisis has brought to the surface by Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his years, 1867-1894 published his major works Capital, writes The KP: As a former chairman of the well-known George Hakanen book published today, Marx's Capital topicality.
"Now he is taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in the introduction.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and increasingly infiltrating all areas of life, the concentration of capital and financial capital and the growing role of an imaginary capital have proved remarkably far-sighted.
Hakam seminars organised by the Capital-based book list can also be found from Aalto University professor, a respected financial skills and Sixten Beckman High.
In his book The Beckman writes Marx to be topical, "now and forever."
Surely the former Institute of business and business delegation, however, CEO of Marxist isn't?
At no.
Beckman High tells me on the phone, she doesn't like Marx timely economics as a fantasist, but rather interesting social theorist critic.
Today, the social sciences are segregated and specialist, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literature connoisseur.
"The common perception is that the history of ideas about the dead men for the wrong opinions," Beckman High to begin.
The truth is that Marx's predictions went drastically wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the Industrial Revolution, capitalism, he dragged on too long consuming conclusions, The Beckman is considering.
But The Beckman, however, sees the value in Marx's radical attitude.
"More relevant in the Mars is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now, discussions about Marx's interests such as wealth distribution.
"Marx might provide inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, as a result of technological upheaval in the changing world," Beckman High analysed.
But that's what the government should decide tomorrow, not Marx's help.
In his speech, he was petrified of capitalism, which should just quit.
Yet Marx supports The Wittman believes the study.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't read," The man says.
"The Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects hated all of capitalism, but even more to each other."
Today, the debate is more diversified, and also Marx cannot approach without the rear after years of ideological and political connotations.
"Every social scientist should have access to Marx's thinking - like other classics," The Beckman says.

Roads leading to the square Rautatientori closes motor vehicles at about 9: 30-14.
Into the area only emergency vehicles.
Hakaniemi metro traffic direction cut Kaisaniemi roundabout, in the direction of the West about the way ever since.
Is there enough people in the Helsinki Police Department, Superintendent Seppo The Parish?
So far, at least, it seems that is enough.
Police industrial issues, I don't take a position.
Helsinki is coming along each leg due to mental expressions of support patrols elsewhere in Finland.
Exact numbers of patrol police won't tell me.
"Some is coming, but as a general rule, we'll be fine on our own," The Parish says.
The police advised against private cars in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.

Stagnant traffic is expected from mid-morning until the evening.
Elsewhere, with protesters arriving in Finland in Helsinki is becoming too much charter buses.
They are not allowed into the iron road to the square.
The buses are inherently time away.
The rest of the trip, then have to walk the protest site, "The Parish says.
Also rallying cry to stop the Helsinki public transport.
Police's point of view, this is a positive side effect.

Police are waiting for mental expression smooth and easy.

Surely the Finns are rational and peaceful people, "The Parish says.
Various parts of Finland will be held on Friday, including local demonstrations.
Friday's statement is in many ways an exceptional - remember these strikes and demonstrations?
A big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday, is in many ways an interesting and unusual.
For example, it is not found in the Finnish political history is a very good reference point, says the University of Jyväskylä sociology professor emeritus of Mater's.
In itself, it is no wonder that the trade union movement is protesting.
If it doesn't do that, it would raise your hands up in front of the government, "says one.
Very right-wing government has hit the Finnish tradition of corporatism in nuclear sites - and also to sites that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
Missing the government's tough approach to contract law.
There's a lot of features that the trade union movement is really trying to get on his knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement has a look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, that the union movement is by no means all of the employees' support for Friday's protests.
The new thing now is a sharp division, whose rallying cry to get amongst it at the time, which the union movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed across Finland, gathered in protest at the Parliament building in November 1993.
If Friday's protest is looking for a reference point, it could be a massive demonstration for the unemployed, in 1993, they didn't have a tower, a Six-says.

Esko Aho (k) government is stumbling around the crisis on the labour market.
It said that the Finnish government and associations of intervals had never previously been as bad as the conservative government.
Now, between the government and trade unions are perhaps even worse than 'murder Thursday in a long time.
Besides, the Finnish power is now very conservative government ever, "one says.
The current governing coalition is way more interesting is that it's so tight right-wing Finns Party, despite the rhetoric.
Yet there was a time when certain elements of the old labour movement.
There are expected on Friday, several thousand protesters.
Also rallying cry to stop public transport and shut down any nurseries and schools.
Although rallying cry to get employees' undivided support, it could become the largest in years.
Helsinki has in recent years organised a demonstration of about 300 per year.
A side to side.
Traditionally, in the Finnish trade union movement's demonstrations has been relatively peaceful in recent years - even though the policies have deteriorated.
Traditionally, in the Finnish rally to avoid conflict, we are law-abiding.
Protesters seek to avoid harm or destruction of property, "one says.

I beat them down a peg or two right
Kerkennah Islands on the east coast of Tunisia, do not appeal to foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are there for the summer.
The islands are ideally suited for contraband, too, because the journey to the island of Lampedusa, Italy is only 120 miles.

Goran is just an ordinary taxi driver in Bogota in night in Serbia.
His cab isn't very good - the starter's on its last legs, and anyway it has seen better days.
Goran customers, the most important thing is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it is moving towards the border with Hungary.
The Bogota eða's 500 inhabitants, a small town about 60 miles southwest of Belgrade.

Of mercy work
A 35-year-old Congolese man known as a missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
He really is the Ugandan capital, Kampala, the Protestant Church, which happens a lot in the Congo who fled from the faithful, as well as a small center, which will help the Congolese child refugees.

Media researcher: Sipilä take a big risk
- according to a diverse array of channels of communication are needed, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel, among others.
Also this kind of direct speech channel is needed in the future.
This won't be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä didn't want yet to assess how frequent habit of television and radio speeches becomes prime minister.
- according to a speech doesn't necessarily always ignored in the future, Len channels.
If the other channels reporting channel, so we'll see.
Now this evening for this channel, Sipilä said.
That's a mockery of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio speech.
This dossier, what we are talking about, is quite complicated and requires a longer argument.
This is why we ended up in the canal, Sipilä explained.
Speech posted at 9: 05-9: 20 and at TV1 that Radio in Finland.
It can also watch YLE in Arena.
Sipilä take a big risk
Media researcher hopes that a television speech tell a more general government's inward-looking.
Any attempt to take a stricter definition of public debate about the law into their own hands and refuse public debate on the issues? "Wonders the Stockholm University professor Tropaeolum tuberosum Koivunen.
Reminds me of Secretary of State (Timo) Sousa's recent comment that he follow the media agenda and not let it define themselves.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not connected.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant that a notification.
It would be strange if the media field doesn't react.
Political communication styles are not information in a democracy.
Representatives of the media's role is by definition to the fact that politicians' agendas are given.
According to the dog's first televised speech is for a big risk.
In his speech, a supposed to bring to the table something new and special, speech to the extraordinarily high expectations are met.
Today, there is more what we have already heard?
Or will he be able to speak a different language, a different way or different words or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is just more of the same old, you have to wonder why such a big gesture was made and YLE gave it an extraordinary time.
To take this risk in a general sense, if it is not a specific situation, but a routine speech, among others.
The danger is that the YLE imprints on politicians or parliamentary and government communicators, which is surely not Yan's interests or general approach.
Siva's mitt it was a smart move
A's upcoming speech, it is also important that what the Prime Minister left unsaid, a media researcher points out.
The evening will be watching closely what Sipilä is missing and what doesn't, says the University of Jyväskylä research coordinator Heikki was heard.
According to the moon's TV speech is from a very clever, because I saw this gets to bring up their own vision without dissenting voices.
This message to the general public without the journalistic filter, unlike the press conference, where journalists are able to ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypass the media and speak directly to the people.
However, the danger is that the media's interpretation of the speech something wrong, because no further questions get asked.
I heard that it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - is that the sweat, whether shaking hands.
He compares that keep his character, who is now tells people what to do.
If Sipilä knows how to present his case well, it can work.
The situation is different now than it was then, if the government should inform about anything, because this person, as if talking directly to another person.
This kind of (US President Barack) Obama and their partners on a regular basis.
Really an exceptional
Political scientist Erkka crevasse to citizens of the prime minister's speech is really exceptional.
He says that hasn't happened in decades, that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
The exceptional times require exceptional means, crevasse says.
Researcher, believes that the Prime Minister wants to get in front of the Finns receptive to blackmail.
Employees "organisations are organising a demonstration on Friday, and strikes against the government's actions.
Chairman of the Left Alliance, SpongeBob Gorka fort says on Twitter that Sipilä could deliver his speech about the state of the nation's parliament Prime Minister's declaration, in which case the speech would also discuss.
SDP chairman Antti Rinne (SD), meanwhile, announces that he's challenging a dialogue.
Now is not the time for the monologue.
Soon the elections for six months.
Forever can't hide, you write on Twitter.

The psychologist advises: I saw you tell children of refugees
Many parents have had over the last few days to think about how to tell the child refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or is it worth it tell at all?
Things don't have to force it up, SPR: The Crisis Group, psychologist Ferdinand Garonne Neff advises.
The smaller children are worth protecting, for example, rather than let them watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what she saw, and it can stay on the road and harassing her, he says.
However, if the child has hit the television news images of refugees or heard about it from elsewhere, it's worth taking up.
Debate is a good starting point to visit the child and to listen carefully to what he says.
A child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones that are older imagines his fear.
Children shouldn't scare in vain, even though more upsets and even frightening.
A smaller child is closely following their parents' behaviour.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the debate, even a child feels safe.
The bigger debate about refugees are likely to collide with kids in school, with friends or on the Internet.
It is good for parents to take the matter up with them, if it occupies a child.
The fact is that all people in the world are not things well.
Parents can together with the children to think about how we deal with this family.
However, we believe that at the end of the world is safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also be different aspects of parenting - some might want to protect their children from anxiety whenever possible.
On the other hand, if the family can also talk about difficult issues, the child receives a model of how to deal with difficulties that may arise in life.
This can be useful to him in the future.

At the end of their own forces?
You can still be a good parent to your child
Blood moon ball lightning striking the country difficult to restrain
Bert Pohjola had milled Clover ball lightning strike up at the height of summer.
It's just going to a win and second place until the end of July at the Tampere at the races came the collapse.
Because the stallion froze profoundly, coach suspected something was amiss and ordered his cover drive from the vet.
An explanation for the fire survived endoscopically.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not a relief to get, but overcoming it took two courses of medicine.
Because the Clover Thunderball was forced to be a gentle exercise, Pohjola says he was pleasantly surprised by the horse's last race.
It was his idea of Turku record second SE-mare's story after the wind.
Clover Thunderball was from the break in their very pressure, when it had been driving normally, just a few weeks.
Those things a little light at the end of the deflection was understandable, Pohjola says.
Coach to assume that a good race for the colt did.
I'm sure the horse breeze went forward, and hopefully, it would also be stabilized.
Clover Thunderball has been the so-called humour horses.
When it is not in the mood, it has been able to throw fat without getting sick, too.
On a good day stallions have instead become detached from the kind of lightning, sprinting that opponents have been surprised.
Shorty speed fellow competitors aren't doing the ball lightning, which comes off even warm blood-ride.
Pohjola's aspirations in Vermont is a pre-race.
One thing, however, is how Clover Thunderball accepts it.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure and may even though the car was a departure from the boom and stuff like that.
Hopefully the stallion would already be calmer than Turku leaving.
Clover Thunderball can also shape when they come to the front, and we're going to push for victory, the coach's permission.
This is why you can't get rid of the useless iPhone programs
The Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least part of the Apple iPhone phones in future programs might be able to sometime in the future - but not quite all.
Apple plans to potentially in the future to remove some of their own iPhone-phones, says the company's CEO Tim Cook Buzz feed magazine interview.
Apple's iPhone is found on a number of programs, which are relatively few people use: For example, FaceTime calls, newspaper kiosk, Health, said Wall Street, podcasts and Vince come to mind.
These programmes is the latest addition to the Apple Watch, which was forced into an updated iPhone phones, even if it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook said Apple's removal of the programs is more complicated than what he looks like.
Some applications is linked to another in the iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems elsewhere on the phone, Cook says Buzz in Bolzano.
Cook didn't mention what the Apple iPhone applications work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work that way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, "Cook added.
Cook said Apple is investigating, because the company doesn't want to waste the memory space iPhone users "phones.
Inflation in the euro faded to 0.1% in August.
Eurozone consumer prices rose only marginally in August, 0.1% year-on-year, the EU's statistical body Eurostat said today.
Rising prices pulled down energy cheaper.
Eurostat revised this in a couple of weeks ago, its estimates of 0.2 percent, slightly downwards.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called core inflation fell to 0.9% in August from July 1.
The Eurostat estimate based inflation was 1.0%.
Energy was the euro zone last month, 7.2% cheaper than they were a year ago.
The 28 countries in the EU, the average inflation stood at zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1%.
Most European countries, i.e., consumer prices rose 1.4 percent in August in Malta.
Cyprus, the lowest prices, inflation was 1.9%.
In Finland, the inflation rate was negative 0.2% in the EU harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains stubbornly away from the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a 2% rise in prices over the medium term.
The ECB forecast for the eurozone this year, with an average of 0.1% inflation.
Next year will rise up to 1.1%, the central bank predicted at the beginning of September, will launch its new inflation forecasts.
The US Fed is trying to tighten monetary policy next
In the US the next recession begins to peak in less than a year later, but more likely within three years, after the country's central bank, the Fed will take a long time to raise interest rates.
And the financial markets, it's all downhill turn, before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted to the rate increases, possibly as early as this week, and no later than the end of the year.
So the next recession may weigh on peak next autumn and orderly exchange as rhythm before that happens.
Or at least that is what will happen if the world's largest economy and the financial markets operate like they used to - and if they react to Federal Reserve monetary taps to blackmail as they have done before.
Such conclusions are reached the German bank Deutsche Bank London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in a large long-term market and economic cycles in its investigation.
The bank was distributing more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study - a research report on its international customer last week.
The research and the report did not convince that he knew exactly when the Fed starts to raise interest rates or what the economy and markets after it happens.
Instead, they make the cut of economic statistics and facts through its calculations, how the economy and the markets have behaved in the past of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at the time and after them.
In addition to the historical findings, they look at what the economy and markets, the key variables are now in the same or a different model than previous increases in time - and what it might follow.
It is apparent that both the economy and the financial markets are now shaky in better shape to withstand higher interest rates than it has been since the 1950s.
At the beginning of the recession, maybe not a year
The Federal Reserve's monetary policy and the stance of choosing leaders along the last summer and early autumn, have been suggesting that the time is ripe to be lifting interest rates.
The first interest rate hike for more than nine years could come as early as this week.
The matter will be resolved during the course of Wednesday and Thursday, when the Federal Reserve Board's so-called Open Market Committee meets to decide on a two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised the so-called Fed funds - its key interest rate in June 2006.
Then ended exactly two years of a relatively small but regular increments of 0.25 percentage point rate series, in which the Fed raised the rate to 1.25% to 5.25%.
The orderly, fair, began in 2007, the US's most risky housing funding difficulties, and a year later, the financial crisis ripped into a global doomsday nightmare.
A major recession came in 2009.
The last time the real economy and the financial markets, serious setbacks started more slowly than in the past, after the Federal Reserve rate is typically the case.
Similarly, tribulations were then harsher and more barren than at any time since the 1930s depression.
Deutschen strategists have been screening at the world's largest economies takeoffs and landings, as well as developments in financial markets since 1950 onwards, and always in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
Increases in interest rates from the Fed, and their economic and financial impact they are reporting since the 1950s.
With the start of the recession, is the first rise in interest rates since the peak of the time in less than a year, mostly in less than three years, and an average of less than three and a half years.
The orderly rise in the exchange rate has been closed within two years of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates.
The Fed has alternately raised and lowered its interest rates since the beginning of the 1950s, a dozen different cycle.
Each episode has departed from others in some respects, and review times is relatively scarce, so they can hardly conclude anything for the next rate effects.
Strategists similar to that this time things will be different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
Crucial to the causes of the financial crisis, let alone the guilty doesn't necessarily have conclusively found even decades of research in the field.
But the three points that led to the crisis and its destructive power of those breeding grounds is probably somewhat indisputably clear:
1) Fed, euro zone, the ECB and other major central banks around the world in the 21st century, kept interest rates too low for too long.
They were tinkering with the traces of the tech bubble, and at the same time, in the next.
2) The - and different parts of the real economy over the decades and the already excessive debt grew by over-loose monetary policy by central banks become even bigger.
Born in the economic history of the biggest debt bubble.
3) In the financial economy, without any arrests or thereabouts compacted so cheap debt financing was dramatised for most areas of financial markets, the largest economic history course bubbles in real estate shares, bonds and commodities.
Either barely creates a very strong argument that more and more complex leveraged the chits heights rising financial markets were extraordinarily dangerous and unstable shape, when was the last time the Fed and other central banks drove interest rates upwards.
On the leveraged-excited financial structures, let alone valuation skupna clubs didn't last as the time after that, when the rate increases had begun, and the cost of debt financing had been turned off.
The risks for the financial crisis, and it was followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutschen strategists do not speculate on what will happen next, but give up thinking by mentioning the subject matters, such as:
1) the Fed and other major central banks are now kept its monetary policy stance is still lighter than even longer than before the financial crisis.
Before the crisis, if interest rates were too low for too long, they have now been even longer even lower.
2) indebtedness hasn't had in a long time is like 10 years ago, but now the height of the debt money is the cheapest literally cheaper than free.
So that's debt finance and the real economy is not a relief, but now in different parts of the economy, a lot of heavier debt load than before the financial crisis, or for that matter, never before.
3) The former profusely and less costly issued by central bank liquidity left has largely stayed out of the financial markets and the main securities - and the most expensive property type, then to the pre-financial crisis peak or at any time.
And strategists from the atmosphere just orderly warning signs, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and recession in decades, the most burdensome model than it has in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak but equally financial pressures and risks are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed's next move be to tighten up their cash taps tighter.
Maybe the French bank société General Beale politicai strategist Albert Edwards picture of the future is not as strange as the imagination can make all the difference.
He is already a good time coaching at the bank's international investor-clients from the Fed following a full translation:
First, the Fed to raise interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon the Federal Reserve is the time to put out the financial fires an even larger Qe-call for the attacks.

Ahtisaari Guardian: The West rejected the Russian proposal to oust al-Assad.
Rejected by the West for more than three years ago, Russia's offer, which the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad would have to leave power, says Martti Ahtisaari, to the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan in which al-Assad would be some time after stepping down in style.
The West is not grasped the proposal because they believed al-Assad's fall in a matter of weeks, anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012, the UN Security Council's five permanent member states.
Ahtisaari says the Russian ambassador Vitaly's charm was listed for him in a private conversation three-point plan: They couldn't arming the opposition, between the opposition and the al-Assad had to immediately get connected to the speech and al-Assad's abdication had to be discreet.
I know she's charm.
We do not necessarily agree on all issues, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said, "Sit Down, Mater, I'll tell you what we have to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
The diplomats did not comment
Ahtisaari says he brokered the dog's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
The dog did not confirm the contents of the discussion paper, but Ahtisaari says it isn't two words.
U.N. diplomats also refused to comment on Mr Ahtisaari's allegations, but said that al-Assad's forces had already at that time have made a series of massacres and main opposition groups refused to all agreements, in which he would have remained in power.
The British Foreign Office's Middle East department's former leader Sir John Jenkins takes the Ahtisaari speeches hesitation, because of his experience in Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the entire war.
The weak point of the Ahtisaari's argument is that the dog has spoken with a mandate from Moscow.
If he had told me the dog's speeches, I would have said that I want to hear the same President Vladimir Putin last night, so I can take it seriously.
Jenkins says he would have even suspected that it would have been Putin's trick to keep power in one of al-Assad's support.
The flow of refugees in our own,
Ahtisaari during the negotiations between the Syrian crisis was dead for about 7,500 people.
The UN estimates that the death toll surpassed 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own actions.
I don't see any other option than the likes of these people take good care of you.
We are now paying the bill, which I instigated, Ahtisaari says for the magazine.
Centre for asylum seekers, Jesus in the tower
The government's asylum-seekers in northern Finland by Organizing Center is likely to set up in the tower.
Centre would be established in the city centre in the empty tower is living on the building.
The Interior Ministry has been looking for a suitable place to, so that the flow of refugees, the Swedish-gain better control of the border.
Helsingin Sanomat, news on Tuesday that the council had already decided to make the school building as a solution to the farm ministry.
Tower's City Council Vice-President Sauli attack the cheesy (left) says it's not true.
When the entire council wasn't assembled, and some of the guys wanted a formal decision, we decided to call the council meeting next Monday to decide on the issue, he explains from NPR.
There was a colloquium 36 delegates, 43.
Organizational centre opposed the 13 councillors.
On the basis of its decision could be expected to be positive, aggressive Karppinen says.
Mayor Timo picked up a pig in the City was contacted on Monday, and the issue of response quickly.
The collective good fit an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been checking to see if it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred metres from the border, so it would be effective in that respect, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still hopes for tighter labour market options.
Prime Minister Juha With a comma (mean) says the public holiday would be halving the money is only part of the government's work to lower the price.
However, he said, the government will welcome package options, if the unions succeed in a match.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he hasn't been in contact with the labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the government organizations are looking for alternative ways to work for blackmail.
If there is no agreement, we will, of course, welcome as part of the overall package.
Halving the holiday money should be fun, I think, as a way of working, because it will be almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's planned by Sunday supplements surgery.
The unions could mutually agree on a holiday money surgery because they are enshrined in law rather than collective bargaining.
The government says in next week to parliament on Wednesday, industrial blackmail Cabinet.
According to a proposed that organizations should have known this before.
The final deadline is not either.
The legislative work will then move the train is moving, and it gets harder all the time.
Now is a good time.
Surely such matters for long, if the will is there, Sipilä formulated.
The government last week with the publication of the list is, among other things, the Twelfth and changing the Ascension being paid an annual public holidays, without a reduction in working hours.
In the first days of sick pay cut, overtime rates will be halved, Sunday compensation is reduced by 75% and holidays are shortened.
The reforms overriding legislation over the unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
Because of the actions of the central organisations are organising a major demonstration on Friday, but several trade unions have declared political strikes.

The Karelian language for place in Joensuu
The municipal government of more radical position on the Karelian language street signs in the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right thinking of the tradition of cattle across the province.
Joensuu will not announce the Karelian capital of language, because there is no historical justification nor the Karelian language is an intrinsic part of the region's identity.
Joensuu region spoken language has been more eastern Savolax dialects.
After the new decision, the city centre doesn't come Karelian language street name signs.
The city of Joensuu is, however, a case-by-case judgment also finished Karelian language use, for example, info tables in marketing and tourism.

The company also said that it plans to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.

The US Federal Reserve policymakers are sitting this week for two days, a huge mahogany table long-awaited meeting deciding whether the time has come to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of luxuries, Double the conference room is a mural in the United States.
The map is a reminder that the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yell County and his colleagues will set the nation's economic interests above everything else.
Congress has fallen on the shoulders of a dual responsibility: They must maximize the US employment and keep prices stable.
After the Great Depression Central Bank leaders have accepted, however, that there is also a third, an unwritten mandate: Economic stability.
It is this third requirement could be the decisive factor in the decision announced on Thursday, which is so tight that it cannot even predict. The decision on whether the U.S. economy is ready to be weaned from the incentive, which until the end of 2008, almost zero kept short-term interest rates have brought.
Although most of the data shows the economy growing steadily, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could be done in advance, are wary of Fed officials are becoming increasingly scared, when it comes to increasing instability. "There are fears, how would, if the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point increase them even.
"Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important points that are being followed," says Lindsey M. The ego, brokerage business Stif-el Nikolaus & Co's chief economist.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for justification for the change in interest rates, increased uncertainty in global markets is still waiting for a valid enough," he says.
The Federal Reserve's decision has not been reached, which in itself creates nervousness in the economy.
Bloomberg, according to a recent survey, about half of which economists predict that interest rates will rise this week.
While financial markets expect the central bank to delay withdrawals, because according to the key indicator, the opportunity for growth is only about 30%.
This refers to the fall in stock markets, if the Fed raises rates, unless the decision-makers and then failed to soften the blow by promising that the next drawing won't happen anytime soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose 3-89 points, or 1.4 per cent, while a new chapter 16 to 59 9.85.
The recovery brought expectations that the Federal Reserve keeps level unchanged this week, says John Lone, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group, run by the chief economist.
"It is surprising, if the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates right now," he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, "they need to see a lot of trouble in his policy to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Some experts claim that the elevated level in order to calm the financial markets, because it would remove the uncertainty about when the central bank works.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates this month, about a quarter of a percentage point, taking the first small step towards a slow tightening monetary status, which would be certified by the stability of the US recovery.
"Ellen has pointed out in the spring and early summer, that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals by their appeals for more economic development.
Though the new job creation slowed in August, the labour market growth has been steady this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, which is the lowest figure in seven years and close to that level, which the central bank to keep the boundary of full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of revival.
Although inflation is still below the Fed's annual target of 2%, according to the Federal Reserve policy makers are the main reason for this is significantly lowered the temporary impact of the oil price.
"The economy will survive even higher interest rates and also needs them, given the tight labour market situation," says Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon-economics Corporation's chief economist.
However, the financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell by up to 16 per cent in May from a record, as investors feared China's slowing economy to slow global growth as well.
This month, the markets have recovered somewhat, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the peak in May.
Fed policy makers market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation, which tells the story of when interest rates will be raised.
"Without these events in the financial markets and the news coverage of the last few weeks, the weakness of the Chinese economy, policymakers would tighten standards at this meeting," says Stephen D. Glinka, "UCLA's Center for Real Estate Center senior official and former central bank official.
He predicts that the decision-makers are waiting for at least a month to get a better idea of the effects.
"The potential impact on the US economy are still very unclear, and they do not have much information at their disposal, what will be the consequences of events in China," The Jetliner notes.
The international economic prosperity is not the main concerns of the central bank, so in principle, it should not affect the decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been immense.
In 2013, the then chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, the implication that the central bank may "reduce" increasing the money supply, caused an upheaval in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interwoven together, Fed officials are expected to not only the next developments elsewhere, including consulting with other central banks in the country, and experts to get a better idea of the global economy.
Decision-making process is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabanovo, Nell, an asset management company, Galveston net Inc's head of global strategy.
Richmond, Virginia-based federal reserve bank (the Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said this month that "the central bank has previously over-reacted to the movements of the financial markets, which has to be separate from the economic fundamentals."
A decision-making committee of the Federal Open Market Committee has called for withdrawal rate, and Lacker, a voting member of the Committee, cites as an example of the 1998-99.
The Asian economic crisis meant that the central bank cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage point during the meeting of the three "despite its limited, identifiable impact on economic growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank lifted these cuts.
Central bank should put economic stability a priority only during a major crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, the Bank of England (Bank of England), a former member of the interest-rate setting committee.
The latest turmoil doesn't come anywhere near that level, Posen says.
"Nobody wants to create a situation where, because of the increase in interest rates, there are fears that the markets are very upset," Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute chairman Posen says.
The Federal Reserve Act (the Federal Reserve Act must still contains a dual requirement, not to mention financial stability, so long as that is the case, I think they should not pre-empt it.

Brazilian paediatric organization in the Rio Grande to advertise a healthy diet for breastfeeding
Brazil's paediatric charity NSPCC RS has invented a shocking way to try to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition during lactation by publishing photos of babies sucking breasts, which are painted descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give the babies all the nutrients necessary for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie around 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that the increase in the number of calories isn't the only change in diet that mothers should do.
Texan Baylor College of Medicine, led by Professor Robert of Waterbury, a recent study revealed that pregnant women with a healthy diet actually affect their babies to their genetic expression and protects babies in the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.

Bariatric surgery can help mildly obese diabetics,
A new study shows that mildly obese patients with type 2 diabetes benefits for weight loss surgery can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics diet after surgery, longer than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"The mortality data for a very long time," Dr. Robin Blackstone says. "He's slimming surgery expert, who wrote an editorial in the new JAMA study Surendra Gargery's journal.
While seeking matching barrettes on the barium in cross-cuts using different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the appetite and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, barium, surveying the cuts has been shown to be effective in patients with type 2 diabetes, but the majority of those surveyed had been morbidly obese, and their body mass index (BMI) is 35 or more.
BMI, the length-to-weight ratio is considered normal, when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person's BMI is over 30, he is considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: "1 / 1 by prosecutors, (v).
For this new study, researchers in Taiwan, Min-Sheng General Hospital Hospital used data collected since 2007, to compare the two kinds of barium, Krista surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gastric reduction, type 2 diabetes drug treatments for people who were moderately obese.
The study showed that people who cut the average BMI decreased by 31 24.5 to fifth by the end of the year.
At the same time, those who were treated by other means than surgery, BMI remained roughly the same, 29.
A 36% cut in individuals with diabetes healed completely and partly by 28%.
By way of comparison, in the drug-treated diabetes healed completely by only 1%, and partly about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL-hole Stallion "were generally better surgical group," the authors said.
The researchers also followed the patients' blood hemoglobin A1c levels, reflecting changes in blood sugar levels over the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c value should stay below 7%, the researchers write.
Post-operative hemoglobin A1c level fell by around 9% to around 6%.
His treatment of the group, however, it remained stable at around 8%.
"This better glycemic control," which improved hemoglobin A1c levels of filming, however, reduced the mortality rate for five years, says lead researcher Dr. chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the results of the average between two different types of surgeries.
For the fifth year, when compared with gastric breast-reduction surgery a fermented group, the gastric bypass group had been dropped more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the index decreased their weight more (7.4 and 5.1%), decreased hemoglobin A1c levels, more (3.1% and 2.1%), and were more likely to have achieved perfect diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7%).
University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that although the study does not show survival or surgery, after five years, there has been research from Sweden, where the surgery led to a longer life, printing most humans.
The Swedish study found that weight loss surgery have obese were 29% less likely to die over a period of 15 years, when they were compared with a group who had tried the more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show improvement in surgical patients' survival, Blackstone says, however, that the results are encouraging for people with a BMI of less than 35 and who are interested in the surgery.
"The findings are crucial in that they indicate that the surgery is safe with a lower body mass index," group, and is not linked to elevated death - or the risk of kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take the weight very seriously, at a time when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when a person has been collecting these genetic changes that permanently prepare her body to obesity and diabetes, reversing the situation is very difficult.

The use of force is never solved these problems, "he added.

Hand sanitizer can contain alcohol anything between 45 and 95%.
Especially in young children alcohol poisoning is needed only a few rye.

"It was really scary," The Shark Pryakhin mother Square Orson Scott said to CNN.
The situation could have been lethal to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers would use nonalcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and would bleach out of the reach of children.

In 2013, two one from Ontario woman died after swallowing hand disinfectant, which contained toxic, unreported ingredient.

Why I prove the execution in Oklahoma
If any legal intervention doesn't happen, later today, I believe, when a man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope that doesn't, spectators sitting in the gallery, the Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison visit, when Richard Glover-P will be executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the deaths of the four official witness.
In January, I received a request through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started freaking out this day as it approaches.
So why did I?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Journalists, of course, will have the opportunity to follow the executions in America, and because the applications are often more than seats, horribly participants are selected through a lottery.
Oklahoma has reduced the media reserved seats from 12 to five.
Whoever then complain, looking cool in the event.
I can't do it.
I'll sit down with Richard Glover next to his closest friends, and I've also created her own contact in the months of telephone calls, as well as one of the two and a half-hour visit.
I like a man.
Often we laugh when we talk.
Prison officials say that I can't be a witness and that the journalist, so I can't be with a notebook and pen to record what I saw.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One inbred Okie journalist claimed on Twitter that I've compromised my integrity.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of his prisoner as they see fit, so you'll be ready.
I complained to a journalist.
Ya admitted that "would have been better to say," but it's still believe that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glover-P has disagreed with some of my words and my writing with things.
He doesn't tell me what I should write, and I would do so even though he wouldn't say.
I told him that he may at any time to remove me from the witness list.
But he insists that there is an international journalist, who writes about it.
If glory-P dies, he believes that the publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Wellington Huff Post reporter Kim Bell software is beside me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to my podcast series-broadcasts.
I don't go through this again with all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glover-P is innocent.
His actions Barry Van Treeya it after the murder, would make him guilty of being an accessory to anyway.
But I think that is a very strong chance that he is not guilty of murder.
Sure I believe that the evidence was insufficient to justify the death penalty.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And so this is the perspective from which I watch her die.
I can't say that I am completely neutral.
There will be other journalists, who take care of it.
I will give you a description about what it feels like to watch a man that I like, die unnecessarily.
The man was lured away from the Canning River - By a watery after the police hunt
Canning Vale officer remained dry, when he lured him away from the Canning River well.
From Perth to be man's attempt to distract the cops off went wrong when he found himself in a shallow, muddy water just metres from the police about the man who tried to "lure him gently back to the beach."
Canning Vale police were called back to his cell on Tuesday, Beck due to unauthorized incursion.
When they discovered the suspect, it tried to distract them by directing the Canning River in the river.
He did not, however, didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water, saying," I don't come out, come and get me ', "said Senior Sergeant Shane O'Dell Castleman Syrup.
Constable Lachlan Perez, c didn't want their uniforms to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "A good officer."
"Sometimes people do silly things while trying to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castleman Syrup.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid the Breathalyzer test and tried to swim across the river to the Swan River.
He failed in the attempt, but was inspired by the local playground to open-minded Ben Cousins' bio-cap's design.
Peter Moody says agents tried to spy on him and threatening to quit the competition
Peter Moody has argued that Racing Victoria officials trying to infiltrate their spying on his team last year, and threatens to quit the competition immediately.
He blames the trustee and Racing Victoria's integrity, the chambers, claiming that they have launched a personal campaign against him. Some late on Wednesday, Lady's rejection of a race day care because the measure was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has been in an awkward position at Wal-Mart's an unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue in check with the spy got a year and a half, and didn't want that, "it would envy."
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I have long been silent on the issue, but sometimes it's getting frustrated so much that erupts all at once," Moody said.
They knew that the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with it, what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and I sleep well.
I want to walk with my head held high and the owners would like to think that I will do my best for them.
When they start to think differently, then I can no longer continue to coach.
Then I would have to consider what I do with my licence.
Moody had earlier dropped a bomb from the dot-com site during the interview, in which he told me that the integrity department had tried to spy on his team.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Gayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man's name when they asked him and offered him a job in my garage, if he cares about what I'm doing out there.
They clearly think I'm a charlatan.
If that's the case, then surely they should fire his lawyer, because they have failed to catch me.
Robert Rock Oulston, Racing Victoria's former chairman, David Moore, Racing Victoria's current chairman, and paired with Bernard Landry, Racing Victoria's current CEO, were all aware of the issue at the time, and are aware of today.
Should I start to think that this is becoming personal?
Whether the Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps to transfer responsibility for other than coaches about what is happening in the field?
Am I the harmful?
Am I so detrimental to the sector?
Perhaps people think so.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and pushed me away, and I have no doubt that what I say now, things might get them thinking about it.
But I am now at that point, I don't care anymore, and it makes me grieve.
It really saddens me.
Putting pressure on them to make a decision, which is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
Coach's frustration has grown long Wal-Mart's cobalt with the investigation, and the late rejection has led him to conclude that could "throw their licences across the table."
Moody, who is best known as the undefeated champion Black Cavite's coaching, has called the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud bath - or anger has been overtaken by the horse, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of the competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on its feet.
It could have been a bath last night.
It could have been that yesterday, as it was.
It was the day of the race.
Apparently, Moore could be facing a three-month competition ban race-day bath because of the treatment, which officials began their investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules, they don't know anything about the horse.
"We all understand that the rules are necessary, but this has gone too far," Moody said.

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy's attack against rivals wrestling assertions
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the two NRTIs L-rugby league's master even claims that his team, no body checking were part of the "line."
Sydney Rooster s coach Trent Robinson said the sacked judges allowed Storm "wrestling" to their side, when it unexpectedly won the final tryouts in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could barely conceal his references to the Storm after it won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night screening of the Stanley Cup Finals. Bennett called the game of rugby league, "window dressing" and said that the two Queensland teams were "very enthusiastic" wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team tackles and said that they only focus on the "contact" in the tackle.
Bellamy added that her confidence boosted by two leading coach criticism against the Storm, because it means that they are afraid of losing the team.
"This always comes up - I heard Trent Robinson talking to wrestle when they lost 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything defense systems or technology in our homes throughout the year. In the last six weeks we have only contact in the tackle, and it has led us to succeed.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he is obviously a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and so this was a shock to him.
It's funny how it always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett-coached St George's dinner, the Dragons won the World Series in 2010 by playing "boring."
Wayne speaks an exciting rugby. "
He was keen to compare Saturday night game for us on a Friday night in a game and tell you how exciting it was their game, "Bellamy said.
I remember how 2010 St George has often been criticized for the fact that it's a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less about.
But now he has a team capable of playing the kind of rugby, which we consider to be exciting, especially when he has a speedy young guys.
The kind of game you want to play, when you have that type of players.
He brought out that side in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt, in order to play that way.
I will be more confident when they say these things, because they are a little bit worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably don't think of us as the important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm and Rooster scores between game was richer than the Broncos and the Cowboys played in between.
Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how does it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting rugby?
Or is it an exciting, breaking the defensive line and failing to score a goal?
For me, this is about lines.
If they refer to us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm has this weekend off, because they have already won the right home game either North Queensland Cowboys or Cross nulla against the Sharks, next Saturday night's pre-finals-mi Park. Tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.

Arsenal captain Mikel is not, says that the boys team have to support injured Jack Wild, sherry before Dinamo Zagreb tie
Mr. Wenger has also stressed to the audience that it's only September, and assuming that he his rehab goes according to plan, there is no reason why he wouldn't be playing again by Christmas.
In this case the best Wilson missed a string of at least four of the next England game, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he was the European Championships next summer.
The biggest shame about this latest problem is that the sherpas Wilson didn't finish last season was strong after an ankle injury, and he remembered the old its sharpness before the season starts.
"This type of injury is not career threatening," Wenger said.
It's a bone, which didn't heal properly.
It's not anything strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his or her ankles previous injuries, what he has been.
This may be true from the medical point of view, but, as Wenger admitted the player trying to go back through the middle, there is always the risk of further injury.
It is also becoming uncomfortable model.
Premier Injuries Ltd, studies show that the sherpas, Wilson has been 23 different injury after he debut six years ago.
In addition, he has played the last five season Arsenal 157 league game just 65 games.
When you look at the broader picture of Arsenal after the 2007-08 season, with six of the eight season, it has been one of the Premier League teams, who have lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their cure their last season's injury statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when we back injury may be vulnerable to the season, when the need to strengthen the body and get a competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will be fine, I'm sure that will happen, and that he can make a career than it deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle team, when Arsenal start Champions League game Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb after playing on Saturday, Chelsea and Tottenham next Wednesday against White Hart pub.
Héctor Belleré and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu, Debussy, and are likely to be the starter.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Girona with Nacho For Real and Theo Walton Endicott's ranch.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and provide a respite for the players," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal's F-block further clear the cacique, Max Kashmir stadium in Zagreb is one of the most formidable in Europe.
Dinamo nor lost 41 match after they were producing their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked Tuesday night, earthquake, which had a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal must learn the lessons of last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco, and motivates him still a distant dream will lead the team in its first European Cup victory.
"This is a huge motivation," Wenger said.
Arsenal have never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We are ambitious but we are noodling.
Hawkwind, Goldsmith Fest: Comedy series, which taught us the serious issues about the friendship between the two men
It is striking how similar descriptions is not a series, especially given the fact that men need to open up is more desperate than ever, and the young man's suicide rate is higher than in the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in 20-45-year-old men in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
The company to tackle the Campaign Against Living Misery seniors (Calm) announced for the 2015 men's aim was to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
The friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
In a recent study, there were more than 2,000 high school and secondary school age students who showed depressive symptoms, according to the study, a person's ability to recover from doubled, if a high enough percentage of his friends was in "good spirits."
Similarly, those who were not depressed, the probability of the emergence of potential mental health problems, halved if they were mentally healthy friends.
But in order for the friendship could work, it has to be available first.
This time via social media communication style goes over the content and an immediate response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Digital lives, have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, although in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists refer to as external: Money, image, social status and all this is happening within the internal values - yearning for personal growth and friendship - at the expense of the more profoundly affect our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer explained recently, the money doesn't really get more happiness.
The beauty of Friends was right there, that it turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters is not defined by their work, but rather their personality, which stood out clearly interacting with each other as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs, watching football, Ross are Rachel - these humour came to learn that yes, men can relate to all of this, even though they are often reluctant to explore feelings perfectly.
As the Samaritan dance volunteer organization, explained to me: "... listening to people who are depressed and suicidal, I really didn't understand how even the slightest interaction with a friend can make you feel better."
Often contact us to take the men feel that they can talk to friends.
The old thinking about "getting over" is strong, as well as the feeling that if you open up problems, is seen as weak.
The One is one of the series, which comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
