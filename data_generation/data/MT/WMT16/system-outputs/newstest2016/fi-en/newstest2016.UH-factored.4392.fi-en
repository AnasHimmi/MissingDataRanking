As their teacher admits shooting his girlfriend during emergency call
Voice only slightly coloured university teacher Shannon Lamb says during an emergency call to the police that he shot his girlfriend and that police must come to their houses.
Lamb stressed that his "golden" dog is alive and will probably be shocked, and said that the dead woman's next of kin contact details can be found on this phone.
Inside the house police found the corpse and Amy prentissin vihon to page käsinkirjoitetun message: 'I am so sorry and I hope that I could cancel this love AMYA and she is the only woman who has ever loved me, "said the letter, which is signed by experts, according to Lambin.
There is nothing to suggest that Lamb, who taught two online courses in Delta State, Minnesota Cleveland universityssä had already travelled almost 500 miles to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed history teacher, held Ethan Schmidt, this office door.
Delta state police chief Lynn universityn Buford told university officials heard of the shooting at 10.18.
He said Lambin call fatal emergency call for some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one more lamb committed suicide: police surrounded äntä.
Authorities are still trying to Determine Motive Lambin days after pupils and staff have had school shootings Why hide behind closed doors.
Researchers in the federal state of both sides have published information that students and staff described lambia for talented teachers who may have problems, however.
Students tell me that they expect his hours.
Prentissin kuolinpaikkakunnan, gautierin, police said that there were no lambilla violent past or had criminal records.
Schmidt himself had included their Lambin Books, in which he thanked the 'powerful people' with whom they share their academic life.
Both teach in the social sciences and the history of the plant, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many pupils attended courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers, praised lambia, but said that he also seemed nervous and troubled, than it would have been wrong with some "ikään. "
The second student Mikel Lambin told Sykes said that he had a lot of stress for the academic year at the end of 2014, 15.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State universitysta say that they have some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university pay principle means that, although the lamb had worked so hard towards a doctorate, it does not guarantee them automatic Career Development Professor and deputy posts.
The university rector, William Laforge said that Schmidt Lambin and between her know there was no contradiction, but that "clearly there was something in the mind Lambin."
These are the questions that lamb is no longer able to respond.
After Lamb had fled the campus, the police came for her track, when he moved back to the state of Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38 pistol in a house kaliiperisella backyard approximately one and a half kilometres to the south in their parents' house in Mississippi greenvillen suburban area, said Washington County coroner methel Johnson.
Lambin car is still in the courtyard of the road.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who live there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009, and taught geography and science education at the university is 3 500 students and is located in the city, where there are approximately 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb was carried out by a doctorate in science education in the spring.

He was quite a hurmuri at that time.
All the girls were melting wax when he was here, now 40 years old, said Hairston, who lives in suburban Jackson in brandonissa.
Lamb and Prentiss seurustelleet had apparently for some time.
In the emergency call Lamb told me that he killed his wife, but their marriage is not a shred of evidence.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with him in the west bank of the river in a brick house gautierissa.
The police told me the dog is OK.
Prentissin former husband Shawn o'steen explained his resignation 15 years ago, but remain friends. They will now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"he was really shocked," the o'steen described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'steen told me that it was not met with the lambia, but I have heard from their daughter abigaililta that Lamb was interested in music and received a telephone call from the Blues.
Lamb met prentissin, when Lamb and Abigail were both there at the market three years ago.
Later they called together a few keikoilla.

The UN says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in response to the fact that Russia will increase military support to Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "will not be resolved militarily," and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and the suffering of millions of people.

8 income support from the time show that Donald Trump is serious about
Some have tried to label him a wind pennant.
Others see him as just a joke.
Part of the expected collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to hilata trumpia Donald out of the top of popularity polls, it is not (yet) failed.
The latest national opinion poll in 11 10, Donald Trump has been a leader in the century kaksinumeroisella, and some have begun to seriously reflect on what this means for the king to appoint real estate opportunities.
Election season is, of course, in its infancy.
These results do not mean that the Republican candidate will probably be trumpista.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing its lead to the rise of Herman cainille, neither of which received the support of a single state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why it would be a problem for him in the general election.
Outside groups, such as Jeb Bush's super PAC and the conservative organization Club for Growth, however, we have taken note of the persistence and begun trumpin uses its resources to his overthrow.
Following the recent popularity survey results point to the fact that there is no property in the UK is only a passing phase:
Trumpin suosittuus figures have made a U-turn.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth universityn popularity polls showed that only two of the 10 Republicans welcomed the King estate.
By the middle of July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52%.
At the moment, six out of 10 Republicans takes Donald trumpiin positively.
About three in 10 say that they are in the negative.
These figures are correct in the first case in the federal election.
In quinnipiacin University poll support in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said that they have a positive attitude to trumpiin.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be satisfied if trumpista should be the candidate.
In the CNN / orc:n poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they were either "satisfied" or ""innostuneita if Trump is the candidate.
Only two in ten said that they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson achieves roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% vs trumpin "innostuneita '40%).
The next largest enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio at just 21%.
On the other hand 47 per cent of Republican voters are "dissatisfied" or "upset" if the establishment favourite Jeb Bush would be the nominee.
Trumpin tulinen nature is not a problem for the vast majority of Republicans.
Even though Donald trumpia has been criticised widely for his bombastic speeches and violations on Monday, the ABC News / Washington Post poll, 52% Republicans according to the side of the inclined voters nationally, thinks that the real estate King is the president agreed the quality of character.
In quinnipiacin last week, according to a survey of the first meeting of the party held Iowa State, the figure is the same: 52% of Republicans think that the leaders agreed to trumpilla is the quality of the character.
ABC / Post poll, 44%, however, thinks that his character does not lend itself to act as president, and nearly six out of ten believe that her character does not belong in the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think as commentators, they are of the opinion that Trump is a genuine alternative.
The CNN / Time Survey shows that four out of ten orc:n trumpia should as a likely alternative to ask who will most probably be appointed for the Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Information: Republican voters julkistus has not always been at their disposal as possible bright crystal ball.
During the last parliamentary term, this time in four out of 10 Republicans felt that Rick Perry will be appointed as a candidate, and only 28% in favour of the final candidates, Mitt romneyta.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican Party voters keep trumpin credible campaign.
Although Republicans endorse another candidate, Trump Win, yet almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that a fragmented field is likely to have contributed to the leadership, because it goes against the trumpin trumpin support is divided among several other candidates.
Monmouth universityn in early September survey, however, showed that in a hypothetical bilateral trumpin games and almost all of the other Republican candidates, Trump gets majority support in almost all cases.
He leads by 13 points, Carly fiorinaa Marco rubiota by 14 basis points, 15 basis points at walkeria, Jeb Bush by 19 basis points, as well as Rand Paul, John and Chris kasichia christietä every 33 basis points.
He is Ted Cruz with equal points.
The only trumpin candidate win?
If he contrasts the Ben Carson, businessman win by a large margin of 18 trumpin points.
Barely a majority of his supporters is Donald trumpin explained the decision.
A new CBS / nyt:n poll for Tuesday shows that just over half of the profitable trumpia voters have decided to Kelle, their voice goes.
The situation could of course change, no one can be absolutely sure to say that it does not ever change its mind.
46% indicated that they may switch candidates.
In any case, the biggest trumpin competitor at the moment, is another unlikely winner, neurokirurgi Ben Carson, but the voters who said they made their decision, we are two times more likely trumpin side.
Six out of 10 say that Republicans are trumpin agree with immigration.
Since then, two months ago Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his opening campaign speech, immigration has been at the heart of the debate in 2016.
Some are concerned that Latino voters trumpin bombast to drive away from the Republican Party and damaging uudelleenbrändäysyrityksiä.
A study published Monday in the new ABC / Post kyselytutkimuksen according to six out of ten Republicans say IS trumpin agree with immigration issues.
So it seems that, for as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
Donald trumpin and Ben carsonin support now covers around half of the Republican electorate, is largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of 10 Republicans said Monday's ABC / Post poll that they would prefer an external policy than a person who has experience in government.
They are also angry at the federal government.
Two weeks ago, Des Moines Register / bloombergin survey of Iowa showed that three out of four of Iowa Republicans is frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% is "unhappy" and 21 percent "really angry."
Jeremy corbynin debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
The corbynin debut at Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
Labour the party of the new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn faces David Cameron for the first time at Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn will ask for its first six questions a little after midday, and, in all likelihood, as well as the media that Labour MPs they carefully guard their performance.
Corbyn has called for the weekly show "less of the theatre and more facts."
He has also said that could leave some of the opportunity in the hands of their colleagues.
This is the first parliamentary test for corbynin leadership after he was appointed to the shadow cabinet and he spoke of the central trade union organization, at its annual meeting on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the national anthem at Tuesday's memorial service, which took place during the Battle of Britain 75th anniversary of World War II, has attracted criticism from conservative MPs and has appeared in several of the headlines.
Corbynin decision not to sing the national song has attracted attention
"his representative has said corbynin standing respectfully in silence" and that he "recognizes the bravery of the British Royal Air Force air war."
Corbynin Owen Smith, the shadow cabinet member, told the BBC twon Newsnight programme that he had urged the Labour Party to sing the national anthem, despite the fact that he considers the Kingdom of greenhouse gases should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow minister has refused to be involved in corbynin insider appeal to differences on economic, defense and foreign affairs, with Origin less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supports him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that differences in the party line on the role of government in the European Union, as well as the aid ceiling is' accumulated ', including the Labour Party within corbynin since the appointment.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the central organization of trade unions, the Labour party is to make a change, which would remove the whole roof.
Hours later, the government, the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, Smith said that the party was "pretty clear" that they only oppose the government's plans to reduce the ceiling from £26 000 0000 to 23 pounds.
The Corbynista will become the fifth leader of the Labour Party, which David Cameron has faced over the last decade, when he was leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics, and now says that he is' mass istanut 'ideas for questions to the prime minister, and received more than 30 000 proposal.
Corbyn's Islington North Region representative has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time nature is too asetteleva against each other and that he intends to abstain as well as for the clever sanailusta that sniping, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn said that the shadow cabinet secretary Angela Eagle works at his stand in for question time when Corbyn is not involved - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues can sometimes be used to give speeches, and he has said that he approached the House of Commons in the president, John bercowia, issue.
When Cameron rose to the leadership in 2005, said that he wants to move away from the sort of political theatre, which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but he later was forced to admit their failed.
Ever since it began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important yardstick for assessing the president's judgement, his control of the House of Commons, and his position on other public representatives, although critics question time has been criticised for the fact that they have become just a caricature of who calls for far-reaching reforms.

Metcash start a grassroots campaign to Aldin sector against intrusion
Metcash is trying to protect from IGA kauppojaan Aldin Attacks in Southern and Western Australia.
Food wholesalers Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend its market share IGA dealers in Southern and Western Australia Aldin 700 million dollars before the invasion.
Aldi is preparing two distribution centres, as well as the first trade opening early next year in Southern and Western Australia, which is on the way up to 120 trade. At the same time, Metcash IGA supermarketit and strengthen its relations with intermediaries, with local food and building brand IGA mainstream and social media marketing, as well as through events such as the Adelaide Show, through the exhibition.
Iga:n merchants and suppliers have jumped on board, and the future of the brand, such as ice cream manufacturers offer dunsborough'sta simmo's maistiaisia iga:n in trade, and the owners of shops selling discounted tickets to Australian football matches for their loyalty.
Metcashin is expected to reveal more details about his defense strategy on 29 September, when this food, alcohol and iron goods wholesalers hold annual Investor Strategy days.
Much is at stake, since the Southern and Western Australia account for a total of nearly 30 per cent of metcashin IGA shops area, and its profit margins are higher than those of the Eastern Länder metcashin IGA network.
The Southern and Western Australian shopping visitors are notoriously parochial and iga:n dealers are in a much larger market share than in New South Wales, and victoriassa queenslandissa: more than 30% in the south and 24 percent in the west to the eastern states, compared with 14%.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi grabbing some 5% of these two state food market within 12 months of the opening of the first movement. Turnover comes from all the players, but mainly from independent retailers.
In its report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that iga:n retailers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million a year by the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year in the South West, and 25 to 30 movement, which produces 500 and 600 million dollars turnover in these areas.

The Morgan Stanley believes that metcashin food and food sales fall 3.8% in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 2015, 14% to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week a leading investment fund manager and founder of Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "may quite possibly lose in decades."
Metcash has declined to respond publicly to douglassin comments.
However, it is understood that members of the government have taken metcashin last week contacted douglassiin.
Iga:n market share has fallen from 2010 about 18% to 14%, and profits metcashin food and business activity, which sends products to about 1200 IGA Retailer, have fallen by 43% since 2012, and this action reflects the reduction of debt financing, with sales and margins under pressure.
Wholesalers, however, to withstand, and has invested each year to more than $150 million to calculate the prices of hundreds of products on a weekly basis to the same level and with the help colesin woolworthsin IGA retailers restore shops by increasing the fastest growing fresh food, as well as to bring to market a better range of products and private labels.

Right now nuorimies is in Glasgow to compete with Sam grothin from another location in kaksinpeleissä Bernard tomicin with reaching the Davis Cup finals against the British.
"I am quite strongly believe that Thanasi has only drawn into rähinään," Healy said.
He broke his bat in the U.S. because of their lost krampin openissa, but he is not the first player who breaks his bat in frustration, and I feel I know thanasin well enough that he is not proud of it.
But he has behaved extremely well, even in fairly provocative situations in the U.S. with openissa Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves the praise.
He has a great team around, he has a wonderful family around, and I think they have been treated a little more harshly.
He is very mature for a 19-year-old, he works hard to fit into the team and so forth, and he does not have and never had problems with the other players with him in the costume room, he valued practise hard, are in good condition and is very calm and mature nuorimies and in my opinion, they should be evaluated on its merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take the start on Friday, according to kyrgiosta important game described this "a joint decision" a good solution for everyone, but I still support the return of the Vaki canberralaisen team equipment.
"we want the team to be fully focused on the game and not all the controversy surrounding [kyrgiosin]," Healy said.
And Nick has really gone up quickly, such as, for example, Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he was growing up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all they get kritisismin. However, we are trying to support him, try to help them understand the consequences of its actions, and I believe that it is best for him and the team that, if he were to spend some time away from the public domain, but consider these effects.
Europe's migration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders, arresting immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern borders against Serbia arrested those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of containment in the country of the future flow of immigrants.
At the border, followed by chaos as hundreds of migrants gathered the buffer zone, and Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who fled the violence in their own countries, have now erected their tents and settled for an unspecified period of time to stretch of road checkpoints between the two countries.
However, the frustration grew.
The police helicopter to stay in the upper half of their immigrants are saying "Open the borders!" and shouting insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water for a protest.
The Serbian foreign minister, declared that it is "unacceptable" for migrants from Hungary for a refund when they arrive all the time more from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause damage to civilians.
The debate should be conducted in the coming days with other countries and with Brussels, "Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Chaos at the border between Hungary and Serbia was born after 28 nationality groups failed in a common immigration policy, contradictory creation in the famous meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed on the division of responsibility between 40 000 people seeking asylum, who have now taken over by the Italian and Greek minister spoke of optimism. Final agreement in the next month or by the end of next year - about what the EU states to take 120,000 additional refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Austrian demand on Tuesday next week for a special EU summit to discuss the continent's migration crisis.
Hungary does not pin their hopes on the fact that its neighbours or to Brussels in the near future.
A state of emergency Tuesday in two southern regions, giving authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and made it possible you can be shut down and for asylum, lawsuits can be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence at the border with Serbia is ready, the country also intends to erect barbed wire section of its border with Romania to halt the flood of migrants through the country.
CBS correspondent Charlie D Agata Newsin reported that even prisoners had recruited according to finalise the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck for the slots and a place in the European Union for the refugees, many of whom are refugees from the war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has however claimed that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, or fleeing from war, who are entitled to protection - and this view is strongly at odds with other EU countries, including Germany, with.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now defined as a criminal offence to cross or damage the company about 4 metres (13 feet) barbed wire fence, which the government has built against Serbia to southern borders, and include long prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"the situation caused by the mass immigration of the Hungarian government to declare a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the southern town of Szeged.
We are very clear on this issue: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament must still formally approve the next week, but the military expected violence asemointi associated express journalists on the border have already seen days heavily armed military personnel along with their vehicles and their dog.
Orban domestic security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that the authorities had caught up with 45 people when they try to cross the border, as well as the 15 countries already in long time.
They came over the fence damage, are now in police custody, and they are accused of offences defined in the new law.
Authorities reap the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed on Tuesday morning, two of the seven crossing from the Serbian border after they were sent in by barbed wire, hide the train carriages to close down one of these places.
The main border crossing near the Hungarian roszkea was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in the metal container handling and crowds of people will cram inside.
Every year, around 20, got in, but thousands were left in the cold.
A group of migrants blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
In the 2016 election: according to a national poll, Hillary Clinton leading Bernie sandersiin side has narrowed the
The former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, will continue at the head of the Democrats' nomination kaksinumeroisessa games, but Senator Bernie Sanders catch up to him.
Clinton now supports the 47% of the electorate (Democrats dropped from 58%), and the second is sandersia support has risen from 27 per cent (17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced that he will leave, according to the president of the games, but he was worth 15 per cent of Democrat voters.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, the majority of Democrat voters said that it is still too early to say that they had decided who to vote for.
Clinton supporters are standing behind their own choice but more strictly than supporters of the other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has declined by several groups in connection with last month's CBS News poll after poll, and at the same time, Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is firmly in charge of women and moderates, but his lead has narrowed.
His popularity among men has declined dramatically, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's head start in less than 50 years of age within the electorate, Democrats lost, and he is now with sandersin levels.
However, Clinton leads among older voters clearly.
Last month, Clinton led by double figures the Liberals sandersia numeroisella on, but now that Sanders is leading that group by 5 percentage points.
About half of the country's Democrats that voters say they support Clinton enthusiastically, if he becomes the party nominee.
A quarter say they support him with reservations, and 15 percent would support him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent did not support him at all.
It is hardly surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be enthusiastic in his support.
Opinions are mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton, only a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
In what Democrats, 48% of voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the Republicans, the same Donald ykkös trumpista says fewer Republican voters (35%).
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question why they want him as a candidate, the most popular answer was that he has the right experience (16%), and then popular answer is that now is the right time for a female president (13%) and the fact that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton supporters have mentioned his links with Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions as well as the possibility of being elected was also mentioned.
Because the vice president seems to be a possible presidential candidate, and 57% of Democrat voters want to see him already participate in the games - even if it is a third disagree.
Democrats ask voters who they would choose for the party nomination, Biden is the second most popular choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half said that they would choose bidenin, which is far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue the candidacy of Democrats, Hilary Clinton leadership of sandersista grows. If Biden is leaving the board, is 20 percentage points, but if they opt out, the figure is 30.
55% of Democrat voters believes that the clintonilla is best placed to win the presidential elections, but this figure is, however, down from 78% last month.
By this yardstick Biden falls short, but the proportion of those who voted for him has grown.
When Democrats voters asked what is most important in a candidate, however, they also raised opinions äänestettävyyden ahead.
Also last month, anyone Democrat candidate or potential candidate was not considered as unacceptable as a candidate for this electorate.
Democrats candidates or potential candidates fare well in some key issues among their party's voters.
The majority of Clinton, as well as keep sandersia bidenia as honest, trustworthy and a strong leader.
Biden faring the best trio in honesty, while Clinton is strength of leadership.
30% of voters say that the Democrats do not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, which is more than twice as much than sandersista (15%), while 27 percent say that they have no opinion about sandersista.
Democrat voters are also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically agree with.
When you look at all these issues, around a quarter of the Democrat voters say that they have no opinion about sandersista.
Although its Hillary Clinton personal e-mail addresses and servers use him as foreign minister raises more questions, the vast majority of the Democrat voters are satisfied with his explanation of the issue and says that this does not affect their public opinion of him.
However, the matter is different, if you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, and only around a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, soon after the matter came to light.
The vast majority of Americans say that the email controversy will not affect their overall opinion clintonista, although 36 percent said that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of 10 Republicans said that his opinion on the clintonista has changed for the worse.
Even though Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and trustworthy, and that is a problem for him, but for all registered voters, only 32% to keep him honest and trustworthy, and that number has dropped 8 percentage points from last month, as well as 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that Clinton is not honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters in the country as a whole nor should trumpia honest and reliable.
Clinton, as well as that, however, is seen as a good leader trumpia.
The study involved the six Bachelor bidenia carsonia, and Bush is considered to be the most honest.
Sandersia considered to be honest, as a rule, but many do not have an opinion about him, just as no carsonistakaan.
The margin of error in the survey, which was attended by 351 Democrat voters is 6 percentage points.
In Ben Carson is approaching Donald trumpia national poll
In Ben Carson as Donald trumpin near the new CBS News / New York Times poll
Two candidates collected in the new poll, half of all the votes, leaving the others to fight on the ground.

The five Brotherhood members accused of Baruch College Student's Death in the first year
Nearly two years after a student died in a brotherhood simputus ceremony in the Pocono Mountains region of Pennsylvania, the murder case has been brought against five people.
In New York City, located at the University of Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood members went to Chun "Michael" Deng was brutally attacked by a membership rite in September 2013, and then the delay in bringing him to the hospital, thereby contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities said that Deng eyes tied and their backs loaded more than 13 kiloinen rucksack full of sand, and then repeatedly taklattiin into the country when he tried to walk across the icy fields towards the goal.
In the end, Deng complained that his head hurts, and then he lost consciousness.
Brotherhood members did not call the emergency number, but Deng pyörryttyä allegedly waited an hour before we brought him to the hospital, police said.
They had time to change clothes, Deng sought online information about their symptoms, and to contact the national president of the brotherhood of Andy mengiin ask this advice, Police Chief Christopher Wagner told a press conference.
"this is where the ritual began burying their equipment and therefore, in practice, placed Brotherhood welfare takes precedence over Michael Deng, chief of police," Wagner said.
Dengiä virkoamaan did not come about, and she died the next morning.
Autopsy, according to the minutes of Deng Xiaoping received repeated blows to the head, objects tylpän body and tyres, fathers.
"too many families have suffered from the Brotherhood simputuksesta, at least one every year when her students have died as a result of the times since 1970," Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng, said in its statement.
Brotherhood and their members must be held to account by the authorities, and this is an important step.
The Monroe County grand jury supported the fact that the first five members receive tertiary Murder Charges
The 32 other Brotherhood members, including Meng, are also being prosecuted for violent criminals and simputtamisesta intrigues.
"we do not want to be held to account only for individuals, but if there is one place behind the organisation, which accepted the situation, either formally or informally, they should also be held accountable," Wagner said in a Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and National Brotherhood, to the dismantling of its links with the local department.
This is what happens, when the US central bank to raise interest rates
Raising interest rates, and rising market rates fall, bond yields will rise and the economic recession.
This we know.
What we do not know is how long this all will go or how long it lasts.
The past does little to aid the timing when it comes to the economy.
The recession has lasted just one day after the first increase in 11 months, sometimes it goes so long as 86 months.
The US central bank's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often, though not always, the defining factor in how the economic and financial resources to react.
That is why the US central bank officials have been so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on that, because the interest rates start to rise, but rather go to the normalisation of the situation in the long term trajectory.
There are indeed a number of variables in the equation.
In the end, however, the participants in the market can see that all interest rates associated with hössötys has been excessive.
"the central bank's first increase since the global economic crisis is bound to be interpreted in some circles in the era of" cheap money "closed", said Capital Economics chief global economic affairs specialist Julian Jessop in a message to clients.
On the other hand, we do not expect that US interest rates gradually return to normal, even though the level is still low, a radical shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that it would have consequences.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy are going to react in the light of these developments, earlier:
As the market has seen in the last month about raising interest rates, waiting can make the situation unstable.
When the increase comes from the fact that the effect has not been quite so dramatic.
"it appears that the return on capital has a tendency to pause for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which might reflect a delay in the monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent research about what happens after the increase in the central bank.
To be more precise, over the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, at around 14% rise when approached, an increase of 250 days since then, the situation has been fairly steady rise in average (2.6%), and normality is reached 500 days after the average yield is six in the last cycle, 14.4 percent, are told in the Nuveen Asset Management firms leading Capital strategy Bob Dollin, a recent analysis published in the journal Barron's.
Deutsche Bank, according to the impact on equities is usually clear upward at a later stage in the cycle, when profits start to fall.
The recession is part of economic life, but raising interest rates often encourage their entry.
In the current situation, the central bank is facing a number of challenges that have not previously been the case, and that could speed up a recession.
This is especially the gross domestic product, which will be closest to its all time low level before the central bank interest rate increase.
At Deutsche Bank, according to the 1950 after 118 nominal annual increases in GDP has only twice been below 4.5%.
While the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6%, few believed it permanent when the third quarter has proceeded at 1.5%, says Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Interest rates at such a fragile economic situation can be risky, and raises the question of whether "This Time Is Different," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants are prepared for the central bank to increase throughout the year, and we are all waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economic experts believe that the committee could approve the increase at this meeting, the futures trading foresees only a 25% probability.
"our research shows that, in 1950, since all the upward cycle have so far occurred to increase the leverage effect of a super cycle, where GDP has overtaken their peak levels before the recession very quickly once the recovery has begun," the report says.
On the other hand, now under way has been exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst period of observation.
In the current cycle the central bank has waited the longest by far since the end of the last recession: there have been record for 35 months, and now under way is already 74 months..
The fixed return is also a volatile market until interest rates increase, and the model is reminiscent of some of the capital the findings.
The main difference is that the central bank changed its line, its effects can be seen more in bonds than shares.
Bonds yields trend seems to be that changes immediately in the first cycle of increases / cuts.
At the end of the upward cycle of government bonds yields will fall immediately, "said Deutche Bank.
Charles Schwab, the strategists believe that raising interest rates leads to long and short-term bond yields closer together, thus offset yield curve.
High tuottoiset bonds often yield better in such a situation, "although we are still cautious about the search for yield," said Schwab, a fixed income analyst Kathy Jones at one analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to central bank policy expectations.
"the dollar's strength and falling inflation expectations, but there are a number of signs that the market has adapted a tighter monetary policy outlook," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are still high, the yield curve has been steady, and credit margins have increased and volatility has risen - all of that is characteristic of the market at a time when the central bank has tightened its guidelines.
In general, companies whose business is mainly in the United States, as the winners when interest rates rise and the local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies which have a lot of debt, and perform less well when the rise in the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and on their debt will be more expensive than what they are funding.
"history shows that 'quality' shares generally are as lucrative as the first rise in interest rates after three months," Goldman Sachs analysts told clients in a report aimed at.
Companies which have a strong turnover, bypassing weak turnover for firms in 1994, 1999 and 2004, after increases of an average of five percentage points.
Companies that have high capital returns and low volatility shares, performing better than the low quality companies. The former average is 4 percentage points (3) and the latter (percentage points).
The debt will be a big problem.
Those companies that have a lot of debt, and most are losing vaihtuvakorkoista, Goldman said.
Stock market speculation on the outside, consumers will have the opportunity to benefit from the rising value of the dollar.
Savers will also be able to make a profit as a result of higher profits, although experts have disagreed on how quickly felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of the classic fm:stä, public representative Andrew Bingham says

Its commitment to live music and musisointiin is, in fact, a first-class.
"furthermore, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding a new music and to commission new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that the channel will have to do more work than we have in the past, reaching out to the public because the British people know less about classical music.
Radio 3 is not the only part of the supply, which was critical of the BBC for commercial competitors on the toes of the entry into the Culture, Media and Sport Committee during a special hearing.
The conservative Tory MPs criticised the Damien Collins voicea, music competition, of which the BBC was bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media for the estimated 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this programme is being discussed, it is often because it is not the original and is not in any way unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 Channel programme, which the referee star Paloma Faith and Boy George, has produced a 'great' in the style of the BBC.
He added that he wants the production companies' own house inside "löytävän success the next time, when it will start a series of entertainment.

At the Lappeenranta University of tough austerity measures, with the aim of saving: 8.5 million savings, reduce staff 130:lla
Lappeenranta University of Technology begin saving Curonian, which aims to cut costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings the university to start the whole staff on YT talks, which will be an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means around 130 redundancies.
In addition, other activities intended to save two million.
Yt negotiations behind the 2016 budget, which anticipates the actual operation of the 8.5 million deficit.
It is also influenced by government budget cuts.
At these accounts during the university makes approximately 2.6 million deficit results.
Costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time, the ministry of finance should be reduced by 2 million and the rest of the financing for the 3.2 million euros.
The university has a total budget of around EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the entire budget.
The massive cuts to education and research, as well as the loss of company Financial Synergy to our universities is highly significant, Ms Pauli said the rector of the university in a press release.

The US central bank must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world is watching from the sidelines when the Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make the critical decision of whether they raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Reuters poll of 80 economists to do little more than half of those who still believe in the last week of the central bank to raise interest rates, now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and kept interest rates at the current 0 to 0.25 per cent level.
This is a historic event, because, when the central bank cut interest rates to zero, is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has a chance to get away from the zero level and to begin to normalise interest rates, "said Angel Ubide of the Peterson Institute for International Economics economic Institue Senior Fellow.
The American economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought balance sheets created a few trillion dollars, as well as inflation.
The central bank does not, however, we cannot ignore the less rosy global perspectives.
It has warned the market that they will be ready for the withdrawals, but the indications are that they also believe that the likelihood of an increase.

When the police reach Highway 1 near Lambin greenvilleä later that same evening, Lamb stopped his car off the road, leaving it to run and went into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb argue about education of science, in the spring of 2015, Delta statesta says from the university website there's curriculum vitae.
The Stars, who lost their charm
Actor in a Motion Picture (left), their son redmondin (right), with the last few years have been tough.
In 2001, he was suffering from leukemia, and in 2009, his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.

Manchester United Luke Shaw has been out for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw had a double fracture to his right foot eindhovenille PSV lost to Manchester United in the Champions League matches.
Although the defender was left in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw could play again this season.
Hector Moreno, reckless taklaus injuries by 15 minutes after a 20-year-old Shaw had crashed to psv:n region.
He dealt with 9 minutes on the pitch, and he had to be given oxygen before taking to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "he has a double fracture of the leg and he is now in hospital."
They will be transferred tomorrow or the day after, and then cut back in Manchester.
This is terrible. The son to the age of 18, Manchester unitediin, suffering from difficulties and after playing brilliantly, and now this happens.
When I was in the costume room, he had the oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I am not a doctor, but the double fracture will take at least six months, and he did not play in the group stage.
I hope that he will be able to play in this period.
Moreno seemed fortunate, or when he got a red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli was not punished the Mexican players.
Van Gaal suggested that Italian trustees made the mistake.
You can judge the situation, when I say that it became a red card and a penalty shot.
It was a really bad two legs taklaus.
Shaw twiittasi: "thank you for all your messages, words are not enough to say how disappointed I am, my recovery is now starting to come back stronger."
The subject: Manchester United and Luke Shaw is suffering from a case of losing psv:lle
The English defenders have added incentive in the recovery next June in the European Championships in France.
Psv:n coach Phillip Cocu said: "it is a really bad injury."
If some players fall out as a result of such injuries, all are very sad.
The players have never been our intention to offend opponents.
Moreno football came when he played in the Mexican team van gaalin against Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno will take this seriously, because it is not the intention to hurt opponents, and when one hears that the injury is really bad, it is bad," Cocu said.
We do not see in that situation.
The only thing was that the ball was going in a different direction, so it seems as if he [Moreno] would be on it, but I did not see taklausta Luken.
Moreno told sbs6:lle: "I know it seems, I know how difficult these things can be.
I feel terrible for this reason, I am so sorry. "
Psv:n Andrés Guardado was taken to the hospital, Chris smallingin challenge him.
I suppose David Cameron feels loraxin this better?
Every parent learns quickly to something: if your child loves something, it will not be long before we learn it almost by heart.
But then, if you are David Cameron.
When the holiday time offering childcare services, asked the prime minister for his favourite children's books, he chose the book Dr seussin Lorax, published in 1971, the story of environmental protection.
The choice was a difficult one, Cameron writes in the message, which was published on the website of the company SuperCamps and continues: "funny, emotional, creative and contains a strong message and I enjoyed when I read this book to my children, because they feel there will always be a picture or message, which we have not seen in the past."
All this is true, but the following paragraph, which Cameron allegedly described the plot, is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which relatively short of the original filling was the addition of new characters and details.
"the walls inside the city where everyone is tarvillen nature is lost, and even the air is a commodity, Ted's son is hoping to win the heart of his dream girl, winning the right to see the wish fulfilling tree audreyn ', the text says, and describes the love story, which in 1991 killed Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, not written.
If this is not enough, I suspect Cameron text sometimes sounds as if it were taken from the Internet Movie Database website found Lorax film plot summary, which begins as follows: "the wall is within the city where everyone is tarvillen artificial and even the air is a commodity, Ted's son is hoping to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey, to their side."
In view of the fact that Cameron has publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he is so familiar with the plot, in which an anonymous young boy hears how he has destroyed the local natural predatory, trees felled and woven tarviksia kerskanen, regardless of the name of the short story, about which creatures viiksekkäästä loraxista "speaks for the trees."
Such relatively invisible PR task will probably be to outsource assistants who apparently has never read books 20 times in a row for the children.
The prime minister's spokesman said that the text has become about Cameron constituency office.
Supercamps confirmed that the text was received from the staff, but Cameron does not comment on the matter at that time either.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being sidelined from the England team, but it was still a hard place
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a hard task, but when you see what kind of Team England has chosen for the tour, I do not believe that a repeat of the last 3 0 series defeat is likely.
I do not exclude any vierasvoittoakaan out of the equation.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but it is part of good spiral lyöjiä and team mentality is strong: they do not have the scars from 2012, only youthful positiivisuutta.
Moeen Ali is developing in its spiral feed-in and Adil Rashid, the aggressor is the option, even if it is an unknown factor at this level.
The subject: Adam Lyth fall of the English cricket team, in his place comes Alex Hales
The decision to leave the team of Adam Lyth is understandably difficult to analyse for me, because i am her main coach at Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against aggressors in challenging circumstances, and simple but the harsh reality is that cricketers will be judged on the basis of their results.
The choice of Joe rootin for example, there was no uncertainty before the release, because, as I have said before, the players are the best choice.
Around 100 basis points more, and lythin era in team have been able to continue, but they themselves are responsible for their own destiny.
Hopefully if he gets more for the race, will be given a second chance to yorkshirelle.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised lythin attitude even when he is not performing quite as well as we could have, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question, how long will the lyöjä without trace.
Lyth was elected seven times to the team, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play at home and that guest.
The only complaint is that the English chose Jonathan trottin to first Caribbean, Lyth was in top form, but it missed the chance is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and it has been lyöjä whom I greatly respect.
He is as cricketers it is something which we in Yorkshire we saw early in this period, when he took 236 points against us at Trent Bridge pitch.
They must be given at least the same opportunities as the others before him, but this of course depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea has been bandied about in the Cook's omission moeenista opening next to the airport, get an extra syöttäjä but keep the four quick, and I am not against this.
I do not understand why not lyöjä could beat the generous, and this is where the left has already shown himself to be a cricket player.
Moeen does not necessarily done its job in his county, but he is in worcestershiressa triplets for them and it makes very little difference.
My old team mates Justin Langer played their first game in the first 38 lattice fall, before moving on to the opening in 2001.
He did as soon as the three hundred basis points and not looking back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a reserve, and its little syöttäjäksi, something which I have been in contact with him, he seems to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his blunt statistics - beating the average of 31, with 35 of the planet - and to think that it is a game of chance, but there is not too much and as voters chose syöttäjiä Young.
He learns a great deal in this tour.
Team outside the English seems to be a great addition to the side of the coach.
Sri Lankans Mahela lyöjän jayawardenen appointment of consultants for the games may prove to be Neron leimaukseksi.
He is one of the nice guys of the game, and brings with it a huge amount of experience, because it is all done in all situations and in all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood will be included in the white ball game, and brings with it a whiff of that energy as well as ruthless.
I have always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it be playing or training, and he has the same use than älliä mahelalla.
Sometimes new voices in the costume room will be able to refresh the team, even if their message is the same as in the past.
Collyn team mates from durhamista, stokesia, Ben lepuutetaan in yksipäiväisissä, was given a similar ceasefire rootille against Australia, and I certainly have no problem with this.
Even if not everyone agrees with the coach, and chose not to do with timetables.
And we have to remember that we, as players, their work will depend on the results.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
A British departure from the EU (Brexit) supporters can take profits if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron to half-hearted uudelleenneuvottelustrategiat British within the EU should fall to a still larger by the day, even if the problems were not taken into account even heartfelt Jeremy 'Is it yes or no? "corbynin choice to lead the Labour party or trade union confederations get angry for Europe on Tuesday.
There are also foreigners own corbyninsa faragensa and Nigel.
A European diplomat crony explained recently that because the EU is so deep in a variety of crises, not all of it is their own fault, some member states are fed up with the British egocentric agenda that is full of divisive and disruptive changes in the contract concessions, which, for the most part, these countries do not want.
In its annual meeting in Brighton the General Confederation of Trade Unions decided that it does not want them, if they are eroding social protection.
We could even call it a daven and George selfieagendaksi.
The prime minister and the finance minister delays from the summit or in foreign capitals held bilateral meetings, take a picture of themselves in front of the memorial to the famous local local silmäätekevän either with or without them, and then come home and say that win allies for reform.
This is what this is all about me.
My European friends, who wants to look outwards for Britain inside the EU tent - "do not leave us alone with the French," said the Berlin - propose that certain capitals short-sighted ministers and civil servants are now at a point that they will not pass on our ice then to leave.
Moderate and cautious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave its action before it was ruined in the same way as has happened for far too long without delay Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and kohlille (16).
In France, François hollandella is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
He, too, is a power fade.
Poland may soon be nationalistic and right-wing, left-wing government in Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries make sacrifices on behalf of selfiebrittien when their energy would be better off directing it to prevent Scotland from the source of the United Kingdom - they do not want to own it the same separatist tendencies.
So, my friends, and some of these ministers will even be able to design deliberately useless comments made by the Scottish National Party in the style of Britain's 2017 referendum campaign in order to speed up the process of Brexit.
"uudelleenneuvottelut was held at uudelleenneuvotteluilla story and" did not have any relevance to Britain. "
The Europeans have had a bitter experience how predatory Fleet Street Press is part of the EU, and how the press are sceptical about monarchy, which it is not in the Tony Benn inspired the 1975 referendum at a time when our membership started in 1973 as a confirmation of the ratio of the ratio.
They can not forget Boris Johnson hämärästi, large euro opportunists, who made a name for himself by writing about his "Banana" is as a direct the EU's Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been silly, but at least they know who their enemy is.
They belong to a patchwork quilt of taxation, shunned veijareita phones hakkeroivia foreigners and individuals whose seat is nominally elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually think of them quite well, but we realised that if you are in the cage with the gorilla himokkaan, bananas have to be abandoned because of smoke and mirrors, if this gorilla does not want to be on the agenda for lunch and then another dinner.
In fact, Miliband was Blair blairilaisempi than themselves when it comes to Cameron to oppose uudelleenneuvottelutempun. In fact, Bair had consented to the principle behind the EU constitution, despite its rejection by French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press did not give him either and never apologise.
But nice to Jeremy Corbyn, a gently patting me on the back of the Westminster parliament building on Monday, I said to him that he does not have any more time to waste on me), would appear to be in danger of a repeat of the 1980s, Neil Kinnock, who boycotted murdochia strategy was a mistake, both then and now.
Although it may take time, however, he has been forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep contact with the media, not to me, but there is no doubt that the Andrew marriin from the BBC sofa Corbyn went on Sunday.
Corbynin official status in Europe, it is a euphemism, evolving.
He says that he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, the majority of the people of the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP and the Conservative Party's war paint intoilun furious Nationalists outside can certainly stand behind this opinion.
"Hilary Benn, Benn, Benn, but not a fan," said the radio and TV that this week, when his internal scouts would have liked to have to admit that the election to appoint corbynin Karski John McDonnell as the shadow government, the finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when her father pappansa pinnisteli in TV is trying to be loyal to the Labour Party, his government colleagues, however, that the world would go so far as to lose its place in government.
Hilaryn pinnistelyt is attractive.
But for it to keep up the fight "in a situation where its good '- Benn utterance - is not what McDonnell said, and by all accounts what Corbyn told the peerage and elected representatives in a private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever it is, it is hierarchical, emotional and personal image that Corbyn wants to send (remember that he even related to me), the communications discipline is important in the 24-hour TV age, and especially in the vortex of social media, which is a breeding ground for persecution of misled and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair to give Cameron free tickets to Europe, by allowing him to keep the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign for granted.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But mcdonnellin corbynin and basic equivocation regarding membership of the EU (and the line is their intellectual and economic to regulate Benn anti capitalist with the past) is no longer just an abstruse debate of left-wing dissidents on the narcissism of small differences, which is a central dogma in legal squabbles.
As far as his duality with regard to NATO (Tom Watson is not convinced that his campaigning in Corby siitäm extradition), foreign diplomats must just try to explain it to their superiors.
Why the Paris or Berlin worth wasting political capital (they too have a sceptical voters) to make concessions to the British, when this may be completely unnecessary?
The United States has been somewhat disappointed by the poor performance of the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the cost-cutting Conservative government was in power, as we were reminded on Monday night in the British Influence Security Forum, a security forum to start.
Public health experts criticised englandin electricity budget for tobacco
Scientists have said that the state agency funded by the argument that tobacco is the electricity of its 95% less harmful than conventional, received 12 of the spirit of the meeting, some of them with links to the tobacco industry.
The BMJ (British medical journaliin) wrote the experts shared lancetiin criticised englandin Public Health (PHE) used evidence in its report on the power of tobacco.
PHE published its "landmark" report last month described it as "a comprehensive overview of the evidence."
Many scientists, however, have questioned the sustainability of the data, and referred to the connections of some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
Medical journals Lancet published last month in the editorial, which attacked phe:n prime conclusion 'extraordinary' shaky ground.
The other two in bmj:ssä wrote researchers have considered the allegations "is built on Rock or Sand."
The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine School, Martin McKee, professor of European public health, and the University of Liverpool Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology, Public Health, said: "the guiding principle is that the policies should be set up to prove the effectiveness."
He said that the public expects the best argument that phe:n "nykyisen estimates that electronic cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than conventional tobacco, "based on the evidence in the detailed analysis and modelling.
In fact, it will be one of 12 in the spirit of the meeting, which was developed by monikriteeripäätösanalyysimalli (MCDA) syntetisoimaan their opinions on the disadvantages associated with different nicotine containing products, and this is the outcome of the meeting summed up the research.
McKee and Capewell will tell you that one of the sponsors of the meeting was nimelä EuroSwiss Health Company, whose director was said to receive funding from the Bristish American tobacco companies for an independent investigation.
He also supported bat:in Public Health powers in the sustainability report, he said.
One of the 12 people said it received funding from the manufacturers of electronic cigarettes, but it is not the funding, which he received in the past, tobacco company Philip Morris International, he added.
Panel members of the selection criteria, but are not told the panel includes several well-known electrical tobacco supporters, some of whom also show in their study received funding from the sector.
The others who were there are not renowned for their asiantuntijuudestaan in Tobacco Control.
The meeting was also attended by phe:n tobacco council.
The group produced research 'telling', admits that there is a lack of "indisputable evidence on harm in the majority of products and most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
None of these links or restrictions does not mention the phe:n report.
McKee and Capewell said phe:n claims that "so far there is no evidence that the electronic cigarette will act as a route to burning the children or not smokers" are premature.
Phe:n health and wellbeing director Professor Kevin Fenton says that in the past has been met bmj:ssä arguments put forward.
He said: "electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than incineration."
Half their lifetime burning will die as a result of their addiction.
All the evidence points to the fact that the electric cigarette health risks are relatively small, but we have to continue with the long-term impact.
There is a clear duty to inform phe:llä audience about what the evidence shows, and what it does not appear to be, especially when compared to the relative risks of tobacco is so much less public awareness.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses, and that smoking costs the nhs:lle £2 billion per year.
Explaining the current evidence - namely the electricity even though tobacco is not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the traditional disadvantages of tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
The BBC would do well to abandon eastendersistä, says former Channel 4 chairman
The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should put an end to programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and the sending of commercial competitors "antaisivat whatever 'such as, for example, to hit this Albert Square Street location of soap.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programmes to which other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticised the BBC for having to put public services under the programme, which is likely to have a smaller audience, the difficult airtime against competitors and watch such channels as bbc4.
After BBC director general Tony Hall has said the company wants to make more cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he comes to Channel 4 in the past six years to establish a relationship with the BBC, in vain.
"I do not understand the idea that the BBC will produce and broadcast, which clearly suited for subsidised competitors," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is maintained - I am not sure that it is for the media or in the long term, a good idea - it should at least limit their production to a programme which others do not and produce.
The voicea sent to important airtime, because its future is to gather as much support as possible.
The idea that no one else seems to, is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why there is a regressive tax to fund programs that could be financed without state aid.
The Voice, and EastEnders is one another, admittedly within a house.
Frankly, other channels would give anything for it.
I do not understand how it is about public service broadcasting.
I do not think that this would weaken the BBC at all. "
Channel 4:ä between 2004 and 2010 led to the serial entrepreneur, Johnson said, that the BBC is guilty of viewer numbers chasing 'targets because of the people who work there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support. "
Their comments on the popular BBC series are reminiscent of the former leader Tony SKYN Ballin. The comments he used in 2003 MacTaggart luentonsa Edinburgh to propose that the BBC sell series such as Eastenders.
Johnson said that the small audience of the BBC public service programmes for which "menevät bbc4:lle often cannot be measured in the number of viewers, but the BBC fulfils its remit and thus can then its £3.4 billion licence fee income to defence of hypocrisy, saying that "of course, we do all this unknown programmes that no one will see." '
They put it to the transmission place where nobody is ever going to look at it.
The licence fee on Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a regressive system in it, who gets the most value for money.
Of course all of you think, we all think that, at a cost of £150 a year to be much value, but I do not know whether this is the case for those people for whom £150 is a lot of money, because they do not use the BBC very much.
SKYN and former Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should make its interim reithin uudelleenarvioida 'inform, educate and entertain. "
He said that only a small proportion of the BBC output as currently to education - he said the figure is about 1% of the TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take inspiration from the Australian and Canadian broadcasting and changes made to "inform, educate and entertain."
With regard to partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should concentrate more on Proms events such as concerts, which according to him on television, only a few commercial airlines and ally itself with in such a way that all of these should be considered on the web.
The 'voice' of genetics allows management of Voice of the waves through the brain cells
A video showing how the worms, the shuttle to change direction as soon as the voting is taking place at its peak.
Researchers have increased the genetically modified worms, which have a nervous system, so that they can manipulate the sound wave eruptions.
Tiny worms shuttle to change direction as soon as the vote comes at a peak, which is too high for human ears to hear.
The impetus to act on linking genetically modified business nerve cells, which are the ultrasonic waves react with membrane channels.
The subject: scientists to read and write the brain activity of light
Researchers say the new worm that indicates that a voice of genetics, the renamed method works in ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells outside of the body by hand.
California at the Salk Institute in LA as a scientist Sreekanth Chalasani told the guardianille method that may one day replace deep brain stimulation, which is a measure of the invasiivinen human brain run electric impulses to treat Parkinson's disease.
Shuttle worms do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that, when they are surrounded by liquid, which is a small microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noted that bubbles was confirmed by ultrasound waves, which then go through the worm.
The ultrasonic waves affect transnational radical 4 4-ionikanaviin, structures, some of which have been in worm cells épée.
The voice of the ion channels open up these waves will receive and activate the cells drawn, reported the Journal, which was published in Nature Communications.
To manufacture the ultrasound guided the shuttle worms, Chalasani worms genetically modified so that the nerve cells in the part of their business is transnational radical 4-ionikanavat 4.
When Chalasani used ultrasonic shape worm, micro bubbles confirmed the voice waves and pass them on to the worm, which they link over the shape of nerve cells in the business.
The method has some of the same characteristics as optogenetiikassa, pioneering tools, which will give scientists the opportunity to link the nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
Chalasani said, however, that there may be some use in sonogenetiikan optogenetiikkaan compared to the benefits.
Unlike photographs, which must be sent to the optical fibre along the desired point within the brain, matalataajuuksiset ultrasonic waves can travel unimpeded through tissue, so they can be sent to the brain switches skull.
"we believe that the gene therapy virus using therapeutic and it may be possible to get the people of nerve cells temporarily react to ultrasonic signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could be to focus on the target muscle cells and insulin producing cells, he added.

The subject: arms trade fair dsei:n authoritarian regimes: arrive in London
A separate campaign, with the bus stop Tube trains and the emergence of a number of posters, who are demanding more access.

In this September, arms dealers flock reaches DLR route... customers asked to help stop the arms fair.

Transport for London is not amused about this unauthorized poster 'vandalism'.
One of the Special Patrol Group collective produce parody advertisements.
Cruel designs curator and lecturer University of Essex, according to Gavin grindonin artists are increasingly calling into question and want to take political work for galleries to external audiences.
A lot of artists have begun to work with activists in the Resistance front, once they have realised that they have to go to the outside world, if they want their art to influence society.
The second poster welcomes työmatkalaisia against arms trafficking in the metro.
Amnesty video is seen through Facebook in the last 24 hours, more than a hundred thousand times. It creates free of charge in advertising agency VCCP, and also the graphic designer and background selostaja worked for free.
Vccp:n creative director Matt leverin discovered that the arms fairs not advertised at all - and also in excelin calendar was empty - and thought: "give them the campaign, which they are trying to avoid."
They are toying with the idea of a realistic murky Corporation advertising, "but the stress must be stopped with bright colours and animation."
"they have done a fantastic job in helping us to raise questions at the fairs sell kidutusvälineistöstä illegal amnesty," Tom Davies said.
Now the UK government needs to take action and to ensure that the instruments of torture are not sold illegally on our own doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art in relation to the arms fairs comes from the inside, when excelin näytteilleasettajat peddle mince fantastic products.

The eight golden rules in student asuntolassa live
It is now 11 years since the age of 19, was unaware of the change when the student asuntolaan still believe helmets and moral relativism, but it is only now that I remember my irritating people forced smiles - and a number of other complaints, long.
A large part of my learning can be summed up in eight simple rules.
The change to the hostels can have any nerves to become quite frightening.
It is tempting to say: what Is lörpötellä, gap year should come from and where, what do you think about, and why the Corbynista "ihan seriously do not love or hate marmitea because quite rightly it is only yeast extracts hahaha we find in my room. "
Breath.
And help other people to withdraw - ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the discussion, and help you find those people who should not be, do not want to talk about in the mesh even though every eyelash is they share and fire extinguishers.
Give people room.
People often change rooms for a cocktail that evening kutsuiksi leffa venue and yleiksi leisure places, but they are also places where people wear clothes and reap their vessel.
In every year of this subject: not even begin imagine universities are intimate relationship
The university is a tough place for introverteille.
A house should be a place of rest, but to a number of hostels in the second bedroom is comprised of wandering, which is a kind of cultural, social, and causes lifelong friendship.
This can mean hell for someone who is trying to relax.
Nothing in this culture does not give you permission to say 'I love you and I want to be friends with you, but you must leave now, that I can collect back energy consumption in my conversations with you. "
Trying to sense when the students are tired of the crony socialisation - and maybe send a text message to knocking on the door instead.
The knocking came knocking: when the president.
One type in my student asuntolassani was of the opinion that if the door was not locked in, he was invited to enter.
He saw considerable stories.
Make friends to bake through.
Since the start of the university term, bake trends summit to knock on people's doors and plates with chocolate leivonen presented itself seems somewhat less strange to me less, "Welcome to the neighbourhood, to bake something, you smile now when I ask you a personal question from the '50 0-lukulaiselta.
The provision is a wonderful delicacies itsetehtyjen way to make friends.
A residential partners feel obliged to talk and it may be that they will continue to unite in the face of a tasty surprise.
This of course depends on whether it can bake.
Badly mixed up with flour, sugar, fatty vamöykyt probably people only pretend to sleep when knocking.
Food theft is a common crime in student asuntoloissa.
Understandably, some chicken export have been stolen but what about if we take every drop of milk to you?
Ask questions and reviewed Dairy owners.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if the boil internally.
If someone steals your story, it is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but I will try to treat adults as I my mates hostels, which confused the milk to detergent to punish those who stole it.
He is now in prison.
You do not become metelöidä so that people are not allowed to sleep or study.
Not only is a decent man, but because it is like saying kettle pot calling the kettle black.
I asked a girl in the corridors of their neighbours, I think I can an irony they call their drum & bass music hiljempaa at 4 p.m., three o'clock in the morning and had their exams in the morning.
The answer was to increase the sound level.
When they eventually hiljenivät in five o'clock in the morning, a girl was kind enough to let them sleep for two hours before they put their own music pauhaamaan, locked its doors and went to kolmetuntiseen exams.
Would it not be romantic if you happen to change your future spouse at the same hostels with you?
Or conversely, would it not be incredibly embarrassing, if each partner should hostels as a future spouse, join together, resign, and then to see him every day, and possibly lose all your mutual friend to him.
Of course, The Heart Wants What It Wants, but if the hot hostels partner is definitely not your future spouse, can at least try to talk sense to each sector.
In the instant when riemastuttavassa noted that someone has left the key to his locked room, and the line is thin between keppostelun bullying than it seems.
It is nice, but a good kepponen are withdrawn in a flash.
You can provide useful and fun teaching security by hiding something - but don't ever confuse some rooms with toothpaste and shampoos.
Its doors and Tiputa spiderhunter they key to the glass of water, which was then put in the freezer - but not paying their property in a blue sticker to the ceiling as the maximum of twice.

According to the clean up of the mess is luukkaisen Wall already out.
The factors are suspected to have been at least three men and they had been on the move in the blonde passenger cars.

This will bring further costs for the practice area for the hsl:lle and their taxpayers.
"we are now beginning to see the different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices," said the managing director of the Suvi rihtniemi hsl:n.
The cost is still impossible to assess accurately.

Sixten korkman, wrote a chapter in the capital, the timeliness of the book, "Marx" is in favour of Look
The global economic crisis has brought to the surface, Karl Marx (1818) and his 1883 1867 1894 published Opus Capital, writes the former chairman of the well-known skp:n George hakanen today published a book with the timeliness of Marx's Capital.
"they are taken more seriously now than in a long time," hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx's assessment of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and invasion ever more widely to all areas of life, the concentration of capital and financial capital and the growing role of a hypothetical Capital have proved to be a surprisingly far-sighted.
The hakasen seminars organized by the capital, based on the author list, there is also the Aalto University professor, a respected economic brains Sixten korkman.
The paper writes korkman Marx is out of date, "Now and Forever."
Surely the former Business Research Institute, and a business delegation, the managing director, however, is a Marxist?
Not after all.
Korkman says on the phone that he did not consider Marx a timely economic thinker, but rather interesting social theorists.
Now social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitators and literary expert.
"the usual idea is that ideologies which history tells us about the dead man's opinion" wrong korkman, begin.
It is true that Marx's predictions went drastically wrong.
Even though Marx understood the nature and importance of the Industrial Revolution, he withdrew from the initial journey of capitalism too far to conclusions, is considering exporting korkman.
But korkman, however, sees the value in Marx's radical attitude.
"the relevant Marx is that he asks good questions," he said.
Now being discussed again even Marx of interest such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx might perhaps give inspiration to those who want to understand the big picture, as a result of technical upheaval in a changing world ', analyse korkman.
But, in what the government should decide on tomorrow, not Marx do not help.
They believe that capitalism is a hopeless case that should just stop.
However, the study supports the view that Marx korkmanin.
"in the 1970s, Marx was not able to read," says korkman.
"the Maoists and Trotskyist sects hate capitalism and others, on behalf of all, but even more so to each other."
Now the debate is comprehensive, and also Marx can approach the world back years of ideological and political legacy.
"every society economist ought to read Marx's philosophy - as well as other classic," says korkman.

The Hakaniemi direction with regard to the transport of shrimps and its kaisaniemen roundabouts, split from the west direction mannerheimintieltä ever since.
Enough of the Helsinki police violence, Superintendent Seppo Kujala over?
For the time being at least, it seems that is enough.
The police do not take a position on industrial issues.
According to Helsinki is kujalan becoming demonstration due to support patrols in parts of Finland.
Police did not reveal the exact amount of scouting.
"some are on the way, but as a general rule, we are doing well on our own," Kujala said.

Kujala estimates that the worst transport sumppu stretches from the Hakaniemi level into the nuclear centre.
Seisovaa transport is to be expected from morning to early evening.
The rest of the protesters arriving in Finland, Helsinki is also becoming much chartered buses.
They are not being allowed to Railway Square.
Buses will remain basically etäälle time.
Final travel must then walk to the demonstration site, "Kujala says.
A demonstration also halted the Helsinki public transport.
From a police point of view, this is the positive side of the story.
Mass traffic flow issue, which is normally present in this big meeting, Labour now regard hoituu itself.
The organizers of the protests have been reported to the police that the Helsinki there may be tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy.
Police expect protests peacefully and smoothly.
Violence is ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, the Finns are sensible and peaceful people, "Kujala said.
In various parts of Finland, will be held on Friday, also local demonstrations.
Friday's demonstration is in many ways exceptional - remember this strike and demonstrations?
Trade unions on Friday held a big demonstration is in many ways an exciting and exceptional.
It does not, for example, can be found on the Finnish political history very good reference points, says professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä Martti siisiäinen.
As such, it is not surprising that the trade union movement is protesting.
If it does not, the government would raise it in the face, hands feet siisiäinen says.
A very right-wing government has hit the Finnish nuclear korporatismin tradition - and also the points which have been of the Finnish welfare state, which are important for development.
The government's harsh interfere with contract law.
There is a lot of the fact that the trade union movement is really trying to get to its knees.
At the same time, but also by the trade union movement is the place to look in the mirror.
Mirror needed, for example, that the trade union movement is by no means all employees to support Friday's protests.
What is new now is the sharp division of the demonstration will achieve it among employers' organisations which want to participate in the demonstration.
From across Finland gathered the unemployed demonstrated in the parliamentary House in November 1993.
If the protests on Friday looking for a reference point, could it be the unemployed, the giant demonstration in 1993, held Thursday, puberty siisiäinen says.
In the midst of a deep recession gathered together Thursday held puberty 20,000 unemployed people.
Esko Aho (KESK) Labour government are stumbling from one crisis to another.
It was said that the Finnish government and employees associations between have ever been as bad as the Aho of the bourgeois government.
Now the government and the trade union movement are perhaps even worse than at the time of puberty on Thursday.
Besides, in Finland is now very bourgeois government ever, siisiäinen says.
The current governing coalition is more interesting in the way that it has been so tough on the right-wing True Finns, beyond the rhetoric.
Still to come was the old jytkyn certain elements of the Labour movement.
The chamber is expected on Friday, several thousand protesters.
Protests will also halt public transport and shut schools and nurseries, possibly.
Although not a demonstration of the employees receive undivided support, it could become the largest in many years.
In Helsinki, has in recent years organised a demonstration of about 300 per year.
It is from one end to the other.
Traditionally in the Finnish trade union movement demonstrations has been rather quiet - although the policies have, in recent years, tougher.
Traditionally in a Finnish demonstration to avoid conflicts, law-abiding.
The protesters are seeking to avoid the destruction of or damage to property, siisiäinen says.
At the end of the 1990s, however, brought a new impetus.
To demonstrate the culture has changed.
EU membership hermostutti farmers throw eggs and police prepared to make pig shit on.
Firefighters to strike in 1998 lasted three months.
It was also a spectacular strikes, including the pilots and air traffic controllers.
Remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The 1970s metal and electric strike

As puberty Thursday in 1993
The Finnish parliamentary houses coast met on 4 November 1993 some 20 000 people, many of the unemployed to work on behalf of the show, I think.
The firemen went on strike for three months in 1998
Firefighters to strike in the 1990s was one of the longest, if not the longest nationwide strike.
Farmers are opposed to the EU in 1994 and 1999.
Police were forced to rain the egg farmers protest against Europe in 1994.

For espalle farmers dumped tons of snow.

In a paper he presented human smuggling tentacles, presenting proposals for solutions and presented the smugglers business from various echelons.
HS is presenting five of them.
Beaten out of them straight away, prejudice
Kerkenna islands on the east coast of Tunisia failed to attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians go to where the summer celebrations.
Its location, on behalf of the island very well suited to the smuggling, because a trip to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometres.
By way of comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn has around 85 kilometres.
There, El attayan village, home to the emir, the chain of burning captain and father of six children.
Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimp fishermen, but it is more profitable to transport people.
The emir has done with its blue, ten metres of timber boat already hundreds of times.
If a boat full of sulloo, to fit 40 people.
One of the emir after earning reissusta costs around 8 000 euros.
The emirillä has five deputy who were looking for him for customers across Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but the Arab spring a huge number of Tunisia wanted to escape the unrest.
Since then, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis flared up again.
Clients arriving from the continent to Kerkenna islands in small groups.
Emir to accommodate them in empty houses, as long as you see fit.
Food is given in such a way that the customers barely stay alive.
Accommodation costs around 75 euros a night, and if customers run out of money, that is their problem.

On the first night of being driven out from the island, then stop, are expected to drive the next day and night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and at 20 metres high Wave and Weeping passengers oksentavat.
The destination of the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and the Emir leaves for the return journey.
There are fears that the emir wants him.
As a result, they were beaten and their clients at least claims to hangoittelijat beaten to death.
He tells the paper that, when police once äkkäsi her, she threw all of its passengers overboard and told to swim to the nearest to this island.

Calm passengers are coming from south of the Sahara.
His fellow countrymen that he is said to be beaten on this.
Beaten out of them as soon as prejudice.
They need to be set immediately, who here.
Just the usual taxi driver
Goran is quite an ordinary taxi driver in bogovaðassa in Serbia.
His taxi is not a very good one - and start the engine of their last water and in any case it has seen its best days.
Goranin customers for the most important thing, however, is the fact that taxi drivers in general is moving, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
It is a small village with a population of 500 bogovaða around 60 kilometres from Belgrade to lunch.
The village is located just next door to asylum seekers in the centre, where allowed, mainly families.
In the centre of the woods surrounding the family travel without their men, laavuissa majoittuvat tents and abandoned cars, what now who has failed to find or build.
In the Forest Live in families who cannot for one reason or another, have submitted an application for asylum in Serbia.
Some people in private housing majoittuvat also, but it is an open secret.
The metsäläisten among Goran found most of their customers.
These are often sick and exhausted - via the Balkan route requires a large number of border crossings and for weeks walking distances in inaccessible terrain, often in mountain regions and in the dark.
To arrive at the end of the region, the great human bogovaðan smuggling hubs, the people are tired of death.
Goranin kyytiläiset are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The Syrians are good customers, he says in the book.
"they say their house once and that is enough," Goran praises.
He says Africans are trying to scale back.
It should not be Goran.
Hölö hölö hölö all along.
First agreed to, for example, the price of 300 EUR, then they go down to the end and offer a 200:een 150.
Goran stress that they are nice and kind-hearted man.
Money does not interest me.
Just do my work and help people, "he says in the book.
Goran says its work more cheaply than others, and they charged on board to the Hungarian border just 50 euros a person.
The journey is approximately three hundred kilometres, comfortably, the biggest part of the motorway.
Members are told to ask three or four times the price.
Goran earn about EUR 50 000 per year.
It is not a large sum of money to the smugglers, but very comfortable annual income in Serbia.

Media researcher Sipilä: take a big risk
According to the We Need Diverse sipilän communication channels, and the prime minister's TV and radio talk is one channel among others.
Also, such a direct channel will be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time that Sipilä said to reporters in the Swedish parliament.
Sipilä still did not want to estimate how often repeated the prime minister's television and radio speech will be.
According to sipilän speeches may not always ignored in the future in the Yle television.
If the other channels are signed up for the channels, so let us see.
Now this evening on these channels, Sipilä said.
The state of the economy, according to the Finnish sipilän is so serious that it requires television and radio speech to the public.
This set of issues, what we are talking about is quite complicated and requires a long argument.
That is why we ended up with these channels, Sipilä explained.
The president sent at 21.05 21.20 tv1:ssä radio as well as in Finland.
It can also be seen in the Yle arena.
Sipilä is taking a big risk
Researchers hope that the media will not tell the president about sipilän television general government inward-looking.
It is an effort to take the public debate a more restrictive definition of the law into their own hands and refuse public debate deliberations? considering the Stockholm University professor ANU koivunen.
Reminds one of the foreign minister (Timo) Soini recent comments that he would not comply with the media agenda and not let it define themselves.
In the Democratic debate and publicity sake I hope that these issues are not related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about the sipilän announcement.
It would be strange if the media landscape does not react.
The political powers of communication styles are not reporting things in a democracy.
The media representatives, has the task of definition to try not to give the politicians agenda.
Koivusen television president is a big risk for sipilälle.
Sipilän should, in his speech on the table to bring something new and special, so to set extraordinarily high expectations are met.
Today there is more and more what we have already heard?
Or will he be able to speak in a different tone, a different way or different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is just more of the same old, I have to wonder why such a great gesture by YLE and gave it in exceptional times.
YLE also take this risk in that sense, even if it were not a particular situation but rather routine, among others.
There is a danger that YLE stigma to politicians or the parliament, government and the media, which is certainly not the Yle public interests or the board.
From clever sipilältä veto
In the future, it is also important to sipilän what Prime Minister leaves unsaid, media researcher points out.
In the evening, to be careful about what is missing and what not Sipilä says, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä Heikki kuutti.
According to TV president sipilältä kuutin is clever, because such a veto, this will bring their own point of view with no dissenting voices.
This is a message to the general public without journalistic filters, in contrast to the briefing, in which reporters can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypass the media and speak directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media will interpret the speech wrong, because specific questions will not be present.
Kuutin according to, it is very important how Sipilä appears in TV - running sweat, trembling hands.
He compared the sipilää father figure who now tells people what to do.
If Sipilä knows how to present their case properly, it can work.
The situation is different than it was then, if the government information about something, because these people were speaking directly to another person.
This kind of (US President Barack) Obama and the partners of people on a regular basis.
Truly exceptional
Political scientist erkka crevasse to the prime minister's speech to the public truly exceptional.

A psychologist advises: times for children refugees
Many parents have been forced in recent days to think about how to tell the children about the situation of the refugees to reach Europe.
Whether it is reported at all?
The matter need not be taken by force, the crisis group member spr:n, Ferdinand garoff, advises psychologist.
Small children are worth protecting, and not, for example, to allow them to watch the news on its own.
Young children are not always able to understand her at first sight, and it can stay in motion to mind and distressing, he says.
If the child has, however, come across television news pictures of refugees or heard about this elsewhere, it would be worth it to address.
The debate is good for children on the premises and to listen carefully to what he asks.
A child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily those whose parents imagine they fear.
Children are not bullied themselves unnecessarily, despite the distressing and even frightening.
Small children will closely monitor their parents' behaviour.
If the parents themselves to remain calm during the debate, so their children are safe.
Older children are confronted with a discussion on the refugees, in probably the boys' school, or with the internet.
Parents take with them is a good thing, I wonder if it was the baby.
Fact is that not all people in the world are things well.
Parents with their children to think about how, in our family to this approach.
The world is at the end of the day, though, we feel safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have a different parenting perspective - some may want to protect their children from possible anxiety.
On the other hand, if in a family and also talks about the difficult issues, the children will be the model for how to deal with difficulties in life before arriving.
This could be useful to him in the future.

Cook did not mention which of Apple's work closely together iPhone applications with other programmes.
There are other programs that are not working in this way.

The United States is trying to tighten monetary policy following Fed
The United States, the next recession will begin its rapid, sure, but less than a year in the next three years, after the country's central bank and the Fed will raise interest rates for the first time in a long while.
And the financial markets will start to rot before the next recession.
It has been suggested to begin work on Fed interest rates, possibly as early as this week and no later than the end of the year.
So, the next recession will be able to print on top of their rapid until next autumn and financial market rate rytinä before then.
Or at least that is what would happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets as they have been in the habit - and if they are reacting to massive monetary fedin blackmail as they have done before.
Such conclusions are arrived at a German bank, Deutsche Bank London market research strategy, Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in his broader long-term economic cycles and market research.
The bank distribute more than 60 pages long term asset return study research report on its big international customers last week.
Studies and reports by strategists do not pretend to know when exactly the Fed will raise interest rates or what the economy and the market afterwards.
Instead, they put in the cooler for the facts and statistics to make calculations, how the economy and the market has behaved in the past to fedin raising interest rates during and after.
In addition to the historical observations, they look at what the economy and financial markets are now key variables in the same or a different model than the previous time raising interest rates - and what might follow.
It becomes clear that the economy and the financial markets are now in shaky condition to withstand rising interest rates than any time in the past since the 1950s.
The recession may not be the beginning of the Year
Fedin on monetary policy and its current leaders are tuning to last throughout the summer and early autumn insinuated that the time is ripe to start raising interest rates.
The first rate increase in more than nine years, could come as early as this week.
The issue will be resolved during the course of Wednesday and Thursday, when the board of the so-called fedin avomarkkinakomitea meets to decide on the matter in its meeting kaksipäiväiseen.
The last time the Fed raised the so-called Fed Funds interest rates in June 2006.
It ended exactly two years of relatively small but regular by 0.25 percentage point interest rates, which the Fed raised its series of interest rate from 1.25% to 25%.
Financial markets oireilu began in 2007, the American housing containing the risk of financial difficulties, a year later, the financial crisis and the bursting of the global day nightmare.
The Great Recession arrived in 2009.
The last time the financial markets and the real economy are serious setbacks began raising interest rates more slowly than after previous fedin is typically the case.
Similarly, the ordeal is just too hard and harsh than any time since the 1930s depression.
Deutschen strategists are screening the world's major economies and the increases in their bills as well as financial market developments since 1950 and always in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
Fedin on interest rates and the economic and fiscal impact of reporting they are doing since the 1950s.
The start of the recession has passed its rapid interest rates for the first time less than a year, mostly less than three years, and an average of less than three and a half years.
The financial markets, the rate rise has been closed for two years after the start of the fedin raising interest rates.
The Fed raised the floor and alternate between reduced its interest rates since the beginning of the 1950s, about a dozen different a cycle.
Each time is different in some respects from the other, and the Times is in the review relatively niukalti, so they can hardly deduce anything certain about the effects of raising interest rates.
Even strategists point out that, this time, a lot of things differently.
Not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
Determining the causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits may not necessarily be identified beyond doubt, even in the decades of research work.
But the three points that led to the crisis and its destructive force increase is more or less unquestionably clear reasons:
1) fed the euro zone, the ECB and other major central banks in the world in the 21st century held its interest rates too low for too long.
They patch up the bubble techno track and at the same time increased the next.
2) the financial and real economy in various parts of the accumulated over decades and the already excessive debt increased from central bank over lax monetary policy to impact even greater.
There was the biggest debt bubble siihenastisen in economic history.
3) the financialisation of the economy, especially the likimain without disincentives pakkautunut crazy cheap debt financing of the inflated to most areas of the financial markets in the biggest bubble in the history of the siihenastisen exchange of shares, property, bonds and commodities.
Either there will be a very fierce controversy is hardly in that increasingly complex leverage on rising to the heights of the financial markets is an exceptionally dangerous and unstable jamassa, when the Fed and other central banks have pushed interest rates up last time.
Leverage on tuned fiscal structure, let alone a valuation bubble going on than their time, since the interest rates had begun and debt financing costs were reversed.
Risks materialise during the financial crisis, and this was followed by the Great Recession.
A bigger bubble and more debt
Deutschen strategists do not speculate what will happen next, but give tuumailun mentioned, for example, the following points:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy still tuning the light even longer than it was before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they are now even longer is even lower.
2) the debt is not for a long time been a crazy cheap as ten years ago, but now its quite literally cheap debt money is cheaper than free.
So the financial and real economy debt load is not keventynyt but now in various parts of the economy plenty heavy lorries velloo debt than before the financial crisis, or, for that matter, at any time in the past.
3) The former and a torrent of cheap central bank liquidity has gone into circulation is largely left to the financial markets and the main hilannut securities and asset types to its most expensive since the financial crisis of the previous peak, or never.
Strategy not only on the financial markets in Latin mood warning signs, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and recession in decades of heavy to model than has happened in the past.
The eurozone economy is unlikely to recover at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak but equally the financial pressures and risks are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed will start to tighten its monetary taps tight.
Maybe the French bank Societe generalen strategy Albert edwardsin vision is not strange as it may seem äkkiseltään.
He has been a good time to prepare for international investors to bank customers fedin next U-turn:
First the Fed to raise interest rates, then the fiscal bubble burst - and soon fedin, time is short to put out financial fires in even greater QE raharuiskuilla.

The Ahtisaari in guardianissa: Western countries rejected the Russian proposal to oust al-Assad
The West was rejected by more than three years ago, the Russian bid, in which the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad would have to step down, says President Martti Ahtisaari to guardianille.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian UN envoy proposed a plan in which al-Assad is eventually receded from power with elegance.
The West does not, however, seized on the proposal because I believe al-Assad fall anyway in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012, the UN Security Council's five permanent member countries.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian envoy Vitaly tshurkin listed for him in the bilateral discussion three point plan: the opposition did not succeed, arming the opposition and al-Assad should immediately get the connection between the president and the renunciation of the Al Assad had to be restrained.
I know tshurkinin.
We do not necessarily agree on all issues, but we will be able to discuss openly.
I told him what I did there, he said, sit down, Martin, so I will tell you what we need to do, Mr Ahtisaari, remember the Guardian in an interview.
The diplomats did not comment on
Ahtisaari says his message to convey tshurkinin for the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin not confirmed to the press the content of the debate, but according to Ahtisaari, it is not two words.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on the claims, but Ahtisaari said that al-Assad forces as early as that date made a series of massacres and key opposition groups refused any agreement that he had stayed in power.
The British Foreign Office Middle East department of the former leader, Sir John Jenkins takes a hesitant president Ahtisaari, because his experience is that Russia was never prepared to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al al-Assad throughout the war period.
The weak point in the argument is that Ahtisaari tshurkin spoke in Moscow mandate.
If he had told me about tshurkinin speeches, I would have answered that I want to hear the same from the Russian President Vladimir Putin, so that we can take this seriously.
Jenkins said that he would be in that case the suspects, and that it must be a trick to keep Putin in power some al Assad supporters.
The flow of refugees of our own tekosiamme
During the course of negotiations led by Ahtisaari in the Syrian crisis has killed about 7,500 people.
The United Nations estimates that the death toll exceeded the 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.

Holiday money is of the view that the halving of sipilän means to act, because it will affect almost all employees other than, for example, on Sunday the government planned further cuts.
Social partner organisations would be able to agree with each other on holiday spending cuts because they are enshrined in legislation rather than collective bargaining.
The government says this in perspective on Wednesday of next week for the Finnish parliament to blackmail the Labour council of state communication.
According to the organisations sipilän proposal should be known this before.
The final deadline is this is.
The legislative work will go into circulation, the train is on the move, and it gets harder all the time.

The US central bank policy-makers will sit for two days this week in a huge mahogany table the long-awaited meeting decided that the time has come to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank, double-decker koristeellista meeting room is wall painting in the United States.
The map is a reminder that the president of the European Central Bank, Janet L. yellenin and his colleagues will set the nation's economic interests above all else.
Congress has fallen to the central bank to shoulder the dual responsibility: they will be in the United States to maximize employment and keep prices stable.
The Great Depression after central bank leaders have agreed, however, that there is also a third, an unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is this third requirement can be a decisive factor in the decision, published on Thursday, which is so tight that they cannot even predict, a decision on whether it is ready to wean the US economy from the unprecedented incentives, which at the end of the year 2008 remained in almost zero short-term interest rates has brought.
Although the vast majority of the data shows the economy is growing steadily, recent turmoil in global financial markets may have already done in advance to guard against the central bank officials more säikymmiksi, with regard to the increase in volatility, how a fear of repercussions if a federal funds rate increase in the reference value of even a quarter of a percentage point.
"understandably, the labour market and inflation is the first and most important issues, which will be monitored," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Stifel Nicolaus & co:n business broker prime economic expert.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for justification to leave interest rates unchanged, the increased uncertainty in global markets is a valid enough reason to expect even more," he said.
The central bank's decision has not been reached, it creates nervousness which is already in the economy.
Bloombergin a recent survey, about half of economic experts predict that an interest rate rise this week.
While financial markets expect the central bank to delay an increase, as a key indicator of the potential for growth is only around 30%.
This points to the drop in the stock market, if the central bank raises the level, if not policy makers, then managed to cushion the blow by promising that the next increase will not happen in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index rose 228, 89 points, 1.4%, a new chapter is 599 16, 85.
The recovery brought expectations that the central bank considers the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, Moody's capital markets research group -rymän chief economic expert.
"it is surprising, therefore, if the central bank to raise interest rates right now," he said.
If policymakers raise interest rates, "they have to see a lot of trouble in its guidelines to support the financial markets so that they will not panic."
Some experts argue that the rising level of reassuring the financial markets, because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank operates.
Just a month ago, it appeared that the central bank this month to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, taking the first small step towards monetary tightening up of the state of the economy is slow, which is certified in the United States for the recovery of stability.
Yellen has said that in the spring and early summer that he expected levels to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals are calling for more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, the labour market growth has been steady this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1%, which is the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level the central bank considers the full limit.
Wage growth has shown signs of stimulation.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, the central bank, according to the makers, the main reason for this is to significantly lower the price of oil is a temporary effect.
"the economy will come out of the larger and more interest-rate level also needs them given the tight situation on the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics company chief economic expert.
Financial markets around the world, however, upset last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index fell as much as 16 percent from its May record, as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy will also slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the peak in May read.
The central bank policymakers market turmoil has an additional element in the complex equation that says because interest rates will be raised.
"without those financial market events of recent weeks and the news on China's economic weakness, policy makers tighten level at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate Research Specialist Centre and a former central bank official.
He now predicts that the decision makers are waiting for at least a month to get a better idea of the impact.
"the possible consequences for the American economy is still very unclear, and they do not have much information at their disposal when it comes to the consequences of what is happening in China," Oliner said.
The international economic prosperity is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making process.
In practice, the federal Central Bank, however, has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been enormous.
In 2013, the then chairman, Ben S. bernanken, insinuation that the central bank will be able to reduce the increase in the number of 'Money' in the market, caused by the upheaval around the world.
In a world where the markets and economies are increasingly intertwined together, central bank officials are expected to not only following developments elsewhere, including other central banks and to consult experts in order to get a better picture of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabell, a property management company, Envestnet inc:in global strategy chief.
In Virginia, the federal Deputy richmondissa ntopankin (), the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank Jeffrey Lacker pointed out this month that "the central bank has, in the past, overreact to financial market movements, which have been affected is separated from economic fundamentals."
The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacker, a voting member of the committee, is calling, for example, the 1998 99 decisions.
The Asian financial crisis, the central bank has cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points in the three meetings during the "despite its limited subsidies to identify impacts of the United States' economic growth, Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank suspended by these cuts.
The central bank should put economic stability to the fore just as a major crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, Bank of England (Bank of England) rate determining committee of former members.
The latest turmoil does not come anywhere near its level, Posen said.
"no one wants to see a situation where the interest rates increase because of a fear that the market 'annoyance, the Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute chairman Posen says.
The Federal Law on the central bank (the Federal Reserve Act should still include dual requirement, not to mention the economic stability, and as long as that is the case, they do not think should anticipate it.

Laihdutus cuts may help slightly obese diabetics
A new study has shown that mildly obese type 2 diabetics benefit from laihdutus cuts can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether live this mildly obese diabetics laihdutus cuts after longer than those that are managed in ways other than cuts.
"the mortality data takes a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, who is an expert on laihdutus cuts, wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery journals.
In other words laihdutus- bariatrisissa cuts used different methods to reduce the size of the stomach bag.
They reduce the sense of hunger and restrict food absorption.
Over the years, the cuts have been found effective bariatriset to type 2 diabetes, but the vast majority of the people surveyed have an unhealthy obese, and their body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
BMI, the ratio of weight to length is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24, 9.
If the BMI is over 25, it expresses the fact that someone is obese, and if a person's BMI is over 30, he is considered to be obese.
You can count the own bmi:si 1.usa / 1D0ZqDv. .gov here:
This new research for scientists in taiwanilaisessa Min Sheng General Hospital hospital used data collected from 2007 to compare two types of surgery bariatrista stomach bypass surgery, as well as reducing the size of the stomach, the type 2 diabetes treatment lääkkeellisiin people who are mildly obese.
The research showed that people who cut the average BMI fell to 31 24.5 fifth by the end of the year.
At the same time, those who were being treated by other means than cuts, BMI remained roughly the same at 29.
The people in the streets by 36% of diabetes by 28% improvement in full and in part.
By way of comparison, in managing diabetes medicines Group improved by a total of only 1%, and in some cases to around 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, as well as the 'bad' triglyseridit LDL kolestori 'are generally good cuts, the authors' group said.
The researchers followed the patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c values should remain below 7%, the researchers write.
Post-operative hemoglobin A1c levels fell from about 9% to 6%.
In the treatment group but it lääkkeellisen remained stable at around 8%.
This better "glykeeminen control ', which improved hemoglobin A1c levels, however, does not reflect the reduced mortality rates over five years, says chief investigator Dr Cheng Chih Hsu and his colleagues.
The research group also compare the average outcomes of two different types of surgery.
In the fifth year, when compared to the stomach reduction cuts happen Group, the stomach bypass cuts the group has dropped more weight (18, 7, 2 and 14 kg), calculated their body mass index more (7, 1, 4 and 5), decreased hemoglobin A1c levels to more (3.1% and 2.1%), and is more likely to achieve complete remission of diabetes (46, 7, and 9% to 16%).
University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix Blackstone says that although the research does not show survival or cuts after five years of existing research results from Sweden, where the cut led to a longer life with weight people.
In a Swedish study concluded that the cuts of meat and wool had laihdutus overfishing was 29 per cent lower than the probability of dying in a 15 year period, when he compared to a group that had tried traditional treatments.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival for patients surgery, Blackstone said, however, that the results are encouraging for those whose BMI is under 35 and who is interested in the cuts.
"the results of the research will be crucial is that they show that the surgery is safe for low body mass index group" and not related to increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should be taken very seriously in the balance at that stage, when the patient is a BMI between 27 and 30.
"I believe that waiting too long before we take this seriously," he said.
I think that when a man has collected this genetic changes which will produce his body to obesity and diabetes, the cancellation of the situation is very difficult.
"not everyone can come to Europe" - The Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot take all the refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is to be found in the Middle East.

The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the killing in his country.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved this problem, "he added.

"after 9 / 11, in a letter to Iskun expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that a solution be found to this problem through non-violence.

Why witness executions in Oklahoma
In the event of any legal intervention does not happen, then later today when I consider the man to be executed.
If that happens, and I hope that we will not sit in the gallery, the spectators at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison, to see when Richard Glossip to be executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses for his death.
In January, I received a request from his good friend, and even though I was shocked, I accepted.
I am beginning to abhor this day approaches.
So why do you agree?
I accepted, because I thought that it would be a good way to tell the story of the death penalty as a whole.
It offers a unique perspective.
Journalists, of course, have the opportunity to watch the executions in America, and given that the application is often more than the terrible seats, the participants will be selected through a lottery.
Oklahoma has reduced to the media bench from 12 to five.
Whoever is elected, then considers the event as a cooler.
I am not in a position to do so.
I will sit next to Richard glossipin closest friends, and they also have to create my own connections made during months of telephone calls, as well as one of the two and a half hour visit.
I like the president.
Laugh often, we chat.
Prison authorities say that no witnesses can be, as well as a journalist, so I must not be a memory book and a pen with me I stored my saw.
I have to just try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused in Twitter that I have compromised my neutrality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoners on their way, so they want to get involved.
I complained to journalists.
Carbon monoxide admitted that "could have been better than its word asetella ', but it is still of the opinion that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has been some of my message and I write with.
He did not tell me what I should write, will not do so even though, he said.
I have said to him that he can at any time remove me from their witness list.
But he wants to see here is the international journalist who writes on the subject.
If Glossip die, he believes that the publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reportteri Kim Bellware Is By My Side.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to my podcast made a series of broadcasts.
I will not go into all the details again in this way.
I am not able to say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van treesen make him in anyway to blame, mutual aid.
But I think that is a very strong chance that he is not guilty of murder.
I am sure that the death penalty is not legitimate evidence is enough.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And this is the aspect of it, which I think he died.
I cannot claim to be impartial.
There will be other journalists, who should be concerned about it.
We get a description of what it is like when you see a man who would die needlessly.

Peter Moody has argued that Racing Victoria trustees try to vakojaan been infiltrated into his garage last year and threatens to put a stop to compete immediately.
He accuses the trustees and Racing Victoria Integrity Services, claiming that they have a personal campaign under way against him on Wednesday, Lady tatain late rejection of the games of the day for the measure because it was the last niitti.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his aim has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has been put in a difficult position after an inexplicable lidarin positive cobalt samples.
He has had to rein in his language spy thesis about a year and a half, and did not, it would seem that the 'envy'.
"I am not going to say anything about this, and I have long been silent on the matter, but sometimes the frustration so much that they unravel all at once," Moody said.
They know that this situation will continue.
Sometimes we just need to react and to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
Go home tonight and I sleep well.
I would like to walk with our heads held high and I would like to think that their owners will do my best for them.
When they start to think differently, then we should not continue as coach.
Then we must consider what to do for my licence.
In the past, moody tipautti Racing.com website in a bomb during an interview in which he said that the integrity department had attempted to spy on his garage.
"a year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man named - he asked - and offered him a job in my stables, if he cares about what we are doing there.
They clearly regard me as a crook.
If this is true, then they would dismiss their lawyers, because they have failed in my grabbing.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, Racing Victoria, the current chairman, and Bernard Saundry, Racing Victoria, the current executive director, were all aware of the issue at the time, and we are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is becoming a personal?
Racing Victoria has finally decided to miehistyä and perhaps transfer responsibility to other than the coach about what is going on?
We are detrimental to the industry?
We are so detrimental to the industry?
Perhaps people think so.
Perhaps they should take my licences and push me aside, I have no doubt that I now say things might get them to think that.
But we have now reached the point that I do not care any longer, and it suretaa me.
It really saddens me.
Put pressure on them to make a decision, which is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
Coach frustration has grown as a result of a long-term investigation, and the cobalt lidarin late rejection led him to conclude that "could throw their licences over the table."
Moody, who is best known as the invincible champion Black caviarin trained, has invited Games Day management measures on rules "naurettavaksi 'after the mud or clay Haude has been put on the horse, which is contrary to the rules.
"it is against the rules of the competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
One of my workers put mud in error to its feet.
It could have been a Haude last night.
It could have been yesterday, even as it is.
It was the day of the games.
The moodylla may be facing a three-month competition ban on games day care, which is why Haude trustees started the research.
It is a joke.
The people who drew up these rules, and know nothing about horses.
"all of us understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.

The Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy to attack competitors against wrestling allegations
Stormin Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy has criticised two NRL rugbyliigan favourite champion claims that his team is part of the 'line' taklaukset.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referee allow stormin 'pressures' in their own half when it unexpectedly won the final qualification in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett who barely hide their reference to stormiin, after it won a north Queensland cowboysit Saturday night in the final game of qualification. Bennett called rugby league "näyteikkunaksi "and said that two of the Queensland team is" very enthusiastic "about the pressures.
Bellamy defended his team taklauksia and say that they only focus on the 'contacts' taklatessa.
Bellamy added that their confidence, added the coach of two leading criticism stormia, because it means that they are afraid of losing out to the team.
"this will always be the issue - not heard Trent Robinson talk about wrestling, when we lost to them 2 to 24," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can vouch for the fact that we have not exchanged anything in our defence system or our technology throughout the year. In the last six weeks, we have been stressing the only contact in taklauksissa, and it has led us to thrive.
Trent has been in the team for three years, and he is obviously a great team to prepare, so he is probably not used to disappear, and so that was a shock to him.
Funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged the idea of Bennett 'exciting' recalls his mentor rugbysta that Bennett prepare St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing 'boring'.
Wayne is talking about the exciting rugbysta.
He considered it important to compare its Saturday night game to our game on Friday night and tell you how exciting it was their game, "Bellamy said.
I remember how the 2010 St George often was critical of the fact that it is a boring team, and Wayne said that he could not care less.
But now he has a team capable of playing the kind of rugbya, which we think is exciting, especially when he has the quick young guys.
I want to play a game when you have that type of players.
He made it out the side of 2010, now he wants all of his playing style - not in any team rugbya is guys like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt in order to play.
I will be more confident when they say such things, because they are a little bit worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they are probably not thinking of us as opposed to the important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the international game and Stormin roostersien was richer than broncosin cowboysien points and between play.
Broncos game is certainly a good game, I have not seen it yet, but the way it ended 16? 12?
Our game was 20 to 18, so we had two goals, but is it more exciting rugbya?
Or make it an exciting line of defence and breaking the mark not to do?
For me, this is a matter of lines.
If he mentioned us, it means that at some point we will be able to play against them.
The stormilla have this weekend free because they have already won the right to a home game to either north Queensland or Cronulla cowboyseja sharkseja against next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Preliminary finals tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that the team mates need to support injured Jack wilsherea Dinamo Zagreb before a game
Wenger has also stressed that it is now up to the wilshirelle until September and the assumption that his rehabilitation is going according to plan, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case from wilshireltä ice between at least four of the next England game, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will take part in next summer's European Championships.
A great pity in this last problem is that wilsheren final last season was a strong individual ankle injury after he and remember their old terävyyttään before the start of the season.
"this kind of injury is not career threatening," Wenger said.
It is bone, which does not properly improved.
This is nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It is not related to his previous ankle injuries or what he has been.
That may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger acknowledged, the player trying to come back in the middle of the season there is always a risk of further injury.
It is also uncomfortable in becoming a model.
Premier Injuries Ltd company studies show that wilsherellä has been 23 different injuries after he debytoi six years ago.
He has also played in the last five months of 157 league games Arsenal in only 65 games.
Arsenal, looking at the broader picture of 2007 08, after six of the eight months it has been one of the Premier League team that has lost the most days because of the injury.
Wenger admits the vicious cycle of chance, but Arsenal believe that their disability statistics last season improvements will continue.
"sometimes when we return from injury can be a sensitive period, when we need to strengthen the body and acquire the competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilises, I am sure that will be the case, and that he has made a career of more than deserves.
Wenger is preparing to circulate its team when Arsenal begin their Champions League game on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb after playing on Saturday and Chelsea'a hotspuria against Tottenham next Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not travelling to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger may also put Kieran gibbsin and Olivier giroudin Nacho Monrealin and Theo walcottin replaced.
"I try to maintain a balance, and it needs to provide some breathing space for the players," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is the clear favourite, and F blocks further maksimirin stadium in Zagreb is frightening.
Dinamo is also not lost in 41 matches after they produce their own "Invincible" campaign last term.
Stadium on Tuesday night, shaken by an earthquake, the intensity was 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It is the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learnt its lesson from last season in the Champions League capitulation against Monaco, and motivate an increasingly distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
"this is a huge motivation," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never reached it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, can be realistic.
We are ambitious but not haaveksijoita.

In attempt to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (Calm) announced the 2015 Men for the year. The aim was to challenge the culture that prevents men from applying for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of these challenges.
A recent study involving more than 2000 upper school and secondary age pupils who showed symptoms of depression, according to a study by the person the opportunity to recover. Doubled if a high enough percentage of some of her friends are in the 'healthy'.
The same with those who were not depressed, and possible mental health problems, and the probability of the emergence of halved if they have to mentally healthy friends.
But the friendship so as to be able to function, it must be a first.
This time to communicate via social media in the style goes over the content of the response and the immediacy is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives, have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and prosperous, whereas in reality governed by isolation.
This superficial success is dominated by values, which psychologists call the external image: money, social status, and all this is happening to intrinsic value - an internal desire for personal growth and friendship - at the expense of a more profound impact on our mental health.
And video game developers such as billionaire explained recently, the money really must not greater happiness.
Frendien subtleties that it was precisely this fokuksen turned on its head.
None of the characters are not defined by their work, but rather their personality that stand out clearly interact as a friend.
And a hug, as Chandler joeyn numerous moments in a comfortable chair watching football, Miss Ross rachelia - this comedy came from the knowledge that, yes, men can identify with all this, even though they are often hesitant to fully explore their feelings.
As Samaritans organization volunteers ...kuunnellessani explained to me: "people who are depressed and suicidal, I really am, and understand how the slightest interaction with friends can improve conditions."
Often contacted me, men feel that they cannot talk to friends.
Old ajatelma "yli about getting 'is strong, as is the feeling that if you opened up the problems that are seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to provide long-term means of survival.
It highlights the friendship between men of small moments.
Although an independent, external position at the other end of the phone to help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from close, personal friends and family network.
And if so, to take part in comedy centralin friendsfestiin this weekend, and all seats have a description of the festival in honour of the planned review, why not take your friends for coffee central perkiin.
Or, better still, if you see someone in solitary starbucksissa, smile and greet.
We can never know how much your friendship may mean.

Malmö was tukkoinen opponent and it won the match in order to reach a solution in celticin at this level, in its introductory kentällisessä has nine international players and two players in defence as well as viisimiehinen deep middle ground.
But the team did not provide the offensive side of little other than Nikola djurdjicin shot 34 minutes, which barely went over from Kevin trappin goalposts.
On the other hand, PSG has had to lurch between for missed feed-in and finalisation of a bad result, especially ibrahimovicilta which failed in all, only five companies in the first half-time and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball inside of ibrahimovicin contact right at the start of the second half.
However, he was far more effective in making its case for the work of his colleagues, and that is what Di Maria sent ibrahimovicin feed-in journey spiral kick, which inclined wilandin goalposts around in the 52nd minute.
The second goal came at the end of the game an hour after his sixth goal of the season that hit uruguaylaisen Cavan thanks after Ibrahimovic knuckles forward from Maxwell's cross ball from the left.
It ended in Malmö in the hopes of getting back into the game, and only a brilliant fight against David wilandin luizin direct kick to final numbers low before the exchange become Ezequiel lavezzin paint was rejected at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide admitted later that PSG is one level higher than his team of Norwegians, said: 'our viimeisein Champions League game was in December of last year. "
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Qualification matches are not enough.
I take my hat off to Paris.
This was a great game from them.
