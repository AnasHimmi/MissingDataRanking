8 popularity poll results which show that Donald Trump is seriously
Some people have tried to label him a tuuliviiri.
Others see him as a joke.
Part of it is waiting for the collapse.
While some Republicans have tried the crystal Donald Trumpia away support from the top, it is not yet succeeded.
The last eleven national from ten, Donald Trump has been at the helm two numeroisella in the 21st century, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the King's appointment of real estate opportunities.
The term is still in its infancy.
Yet these results do not mean that Trump is likely to be the Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing its lead to the rise of Herman Cain, neither of which led to any of the states in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have a problem in general elections.
Outside groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and conservative economic organization Club for Growth, have, however, noted Trump's persistence and have begun to use its resources to topple him.
Following the recent popularity poll results suggest that real estate king is only a passing phase:
The popularity of Trump's figures have done a U-turn.
Just before the break when Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's popularity polls showed that only two out of ten Republican welcomed the king of real estate.
By the middle of July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52%.
At the moment, about six in 10 Republicans will react positively to Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say that they are negative.
These figures are correct, but also the first primaries states.
Quinn ipia Iowassa poll last week in support of the University, 60 percent of Republicans said that they are sympathetic to the Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy, if Trump became a candidate.
The CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "pleased" that if Trump would be a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said that they would be "shocked" if he becomes the nominee.
Only Ben Carson get roughly the same level of enthusiasm than Trump - 43% to 40% by 'enthusiastic' vs. Trump.
Next, causing the most excitement?
Only 21% of Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "dissatisfied" or "shocked" if power from suosikista Jeb Bush would be the candidate.
The explosive nature of Trump's is not a problem for the vast majority of Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpia is widely criticized for his bombastic speeches and their violations, Monday, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52% of voters in the side of the Republicans at the national level, the King thinks that real estate is the quality of the good character of the president.
Quinn ipia of last week, according to the poll in the first party meeting in the state of Iowa's figure is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think that Trump has the leader of good quality.
According to the ABC/Post poll, 44%, however, thinks that his character is suited to the office of president, and nearly six in ten believe that his character does not belong to the White House.
The voters totutteleva idea.
When Republican voters think as commentators, they are of the opinion that Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC poll, four out of 10 had Trumpia as the most likely option asked who most probably will be appointed as the Republicans.
Yet at the end of July, four out of 10 supported Jeb Bush.
Data julkistus: Republican voters have not always been the most possible in the crystal ball.
In the last term at this time was about four in 10 Republicans think that Rick Perry is appointed as a candidate, and only 28% backed the final candidate, central to the Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters to Trump's campaign as credible.
While the republicans would stand to support another kandidaattia, Trump won yet almost every time.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field probably has contributed to Trump's leadership, as against Trump's support is divided among numerous other kandidaattien.
By early September of Monmouth University poll, however, showed that between Trump and almost all the other Republicans in hypothetical bilateral kisassa kandidaattien, Trump gets majority support in almost all cases.
He leads by 13 points to Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Walker by 15 points, 14 points by 19 points, and John Kasich and Chris Christie, Rand Paulia for every 33 basis points.
He is tied with Ted Cruz's points.
Only Trump's winning candidate?
If they are set against each other, Ben Carson won a businessman Trump by a margin of 18 points.
Just the majority of supporters by Donald Trump has made the decision.
A new CBS/NOW: The poll out Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half Trumpia profitable voters have decided, whom their voice goes.
The situation can change of course, and no one can quite say for certain that never change their minds.
46% said that they can possibly change kandidaattia.
In any event, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgical, Ben Carson, but the voters who said they made the decision, are two times more likely Trump's side.
About six in 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump's immigration.
Since then, two months ago, after Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants as "rapists" campaign kick-off speech, the immigration debate has been the centre of the year 2016.
Some people are worried that Trump's bombastic nature drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and damages brändäys businesses again.
According to the new ABC/Post poll published on Monday, about six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump's immigration issues.
So, it seems, so long as immigration is at the centre of things, so is Donald Trump.
The frustration of the government has reached a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson's popularity now covers about half of the Republican electorate, owing largely outside of their status.
Six in 10 Republicans said on Monday the ABC/Post poll that they prefer the person as someone with government experience outside politics.
They are also angry at the federal government.
Two weeks ago Des, Iowa from Iowa Register/Bloomberg survey showed that three out of four of the Iowa Republican is frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% is "unhappy" and "really angry" at 21%.
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance in the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first performances on Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
The new leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn faces David Cameron, the Prime Minister's Question Time for the first time.
Corbyn will ask the first six questions to the media shortly after midday, and the likelihood is that Labour MPs were minding his performance closely.
Corbyn has called for this weekly spectacle "less theatre and more facts."
He has also said that could leave some of the opportunities to their colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership after he was appointed shadow government and he spoke on Tuesday at the annual meeting of the Confederation of trade unions.
At the same time, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the national anthem at a memorial service was held on Tuesday to battle the air in Britain - on the 75th anniversary of the war, has provoked criticism from Conservative MPs and appeared in several front pages.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn's spokesman said he "respectfully standing in silence" and that he recognizes "the Royal Artillery of bravery in Great Britain in the war in the air."
Corbyn's shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he had urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem, despite her royal family should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow minister has refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, citing differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Initially less than one sixth of the House Party endorsed him for president.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that line the differences on the role of the party in the European Union, as well as a storehouse of government aid are "accumulated" after the appointment of Mr Corbyn even within the Labour Party.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the confederation of trade unions, the Labour Party to make the change, which would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the shadow work and pensions secretary of the government, Mr Smith said that the party was "very clear" about it, only that they are protesting against the government's plans to put a figure on the roof of 26 000 0000 23 in the pound to sterling.
Corbyn will become the fifth leader of the Labour Party, which David Cameron has faced in the last decade, when he was leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has "a number of" ideas for the Prime Minister, and received more than 30,000 of the proposal.
London Borough of Islington North MP Corbyn in the region has said that the character of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too opposite his, and that he will refrain from both witty banter that instead of sniping on the promise to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that economic secretary, Angela Eagle, the shadow government works for him during Question Time when Corbyn not involved - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues could sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said of his approach, the President of the House of Commons, John Berar cow in the matter.
When Cameron took over in 2005, he said that he wants to move away from the kind of political theatre, which is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but he later had to admit they have failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important indicator in evaluating the prudence of leader, his control of the House of Commons, as well as his position on the other deputies, although critics have criticised the poll hours that they have become just a caricature, which calls for far-reaching reforms.

When he broke his bat leaves krampin because U.S. Openissa, but he is not the first player who breaks his bat in frustration, and the feeling in the well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But he has behaved very well, but also quite provocative situations with U.S. Openissa Harrison and so on and so forth, and I think he deserves the praise.
He has a great team around her, she has a great family around her, and I think he has been treated rather harshly.
He is very mature to the age of 19, he is working hard to fit into the team and so on and so forth, and he never had problems with the other players. He valued pukuhuoneessa, he you practise hard, is in good condition and is very calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged on its merits.
Healy has also supported the decision to ignore the Kyrgios according to important games starting on Friday described a "collective decision" for the benefit of all, as a solution to the problem, but still can berr a comeback team regular rolling stock.
"I want the team to be fully focused on games and all the controversy around the [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen very rapidly, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he adult in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all of its kritis. However, we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of their actions, and I believe that is the best thing for the team and for him, if he would like to spend some time away from the public domain in the consideration of these consequences.
The European migration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closing the borders, to detain immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern borders against Serbia's arrest of those who tried to enter the country illegally, and is aimed at stemming the flow of migrants coming into the country.
The border chaos has ensued, with hundreds of migrants gathered in neutral territory, and the Serbian authorities reacted by outrage.
People who fled violence in their home countries, have now set up their tent and settled for an unspecified period tienpätkä skip the checkpoints between the two countries.
However, frustration grew.
The police helicopter distance above them by the immigrants were "Open the borders!" and by the insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water as a protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared that it is "unacceptable" for immigrants from Hungary, when they arrive back at all times more of Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to harm civilians.
The debate should be conducted in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," I District Dacic said in Prague.
Chaos at the border between Hungary and Serbia was born after 28: The nationality of the bloc failed to shaping a common immigration policy in a contentious meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed the division of responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking asylum, who are now in power have Italian and Greek ministers spoke optimistically of reaching a final agreement by the end of next month or next year - about what the EU countries will take an additional 120 000 refugees, including some from Hungary.

Hungary does not put its neighbours or Brussels in the hope that it would work in the near future.
A state of emergency in two southern region on Tuesday gave the authorities greater powers to act in the face of the crisis and made it possible that you can be shut down and the right of asylum cases can be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now the fence on the border with Serbia is ready, the country also intends to erect barbed wire against some of the Romanian border to halt the flow of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D's Agatha reported that even prisoners were recruited into the final touches to the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the last few months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck in a seat in the European Union and the arrival of the refugees, many of whom are war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has, however, claimed that the majority of migrants are economic immigrants looking for a better life, and are fleeing from the war, who are entitled to the protection of this vision is very much at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, define a crime of the company now exceeds or harm - 4 metres - 13 feet of barbed wire fence, built by the government of Serbia against the southern border, as well as provide longer prison sentences for traffickers.
"because of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government declared a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan, told journalists in the south Szeged - in the city.
We are very clear on this matter: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament must still formally approve the asemointi expected next week, but Associated Press journalists on the border have seen days already heavily armed military personnel and their vehicles and dog.
Mr Orban's homeland security adviser Gyor gy BA kondi said that the authorities had taken hold of their 45 people trying to cross the border, as well as 15 already reached further into the country.
They came over by hitting a wall, are now being detained by the police and accused of offences defined in the new laws.
The authorities are reaping the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials turned on Tuesday morning, two out of seven crossing from Serbia to the border after they were sent to the home town of barbed wire to close down one of those places.
Principal crossing near Roszk Bowe metal konttiin eclipsed the chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in Hungary for the treatment of the people and the crowds were sequestered inside.
About 20 came in, but thousands remained outside.
A group of migrants blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary, that they refuse food and drinking, until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
Election 2016: Bernie Sanders on Hillary Clinton's lead has narrowed, according to a national survey on the side
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue to number two in charge of appointing Democrats kisassa, but Senator Bernie Sanders was caught up to him.
Clinton now supports Democrats 47% of the electorate - a drop of 58%, and the second for the Sanders supports 27% - an increase of 17%.
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he starts a contest for the president, but he is worth 15% of the Democratic electorate.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, a majority of Democratic voters, says that it is still too early to say that they have decided whom to vote for.
Clinton's supporters are standing behind their own choice, however, more than other kandidaattien supporters.
Clinton's popularity has dropped since last month's CBS News poll survey on various demographic groups, and at the same time, Sanders has risen slightly.
Clinton has a strong lead among women and moderates, but his leadership has been reduced.
His popularity among men has dropped considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and she is now all square with the Sanders.
Clearly, however, Clinton leads among older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders, double numeroisella on liberals in the 21st century, but now Sanders leads this group by five points.
About half of Democratic voters say they support Clinton enthusiastically, if he becomes the party's candidate.
A quarter said their support for him, with some reservations, and 15% would support him just because he is a candidate.
6% would support him in any way.
Not so surprising that the current Clinton supporters are very likely to be enthusiastic in his support.
Opinions are confusing to those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they support Clinton enthusiastically, the Republicans, with one man of Donald Trump says fewer Republican voters - 35%.
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him as a candidate, the most popular answer was that he has appropriate experience - 16%. After that were the most popular answers that now is the right time for a female president - 13%, and that he is the best candidate for the job - 10%.
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his links to Bill Clinton - 9%.
The same opinions as well as the chance to be elected, has also been mentioned.
As to the potential impact of the Vice Presidential nominee, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him involved already kisassa - although a third disagreed.
Asked Democratic voters who will choose the party's second nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton's supporters more than half saying that they choose Biden, who is far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek the Democratic candidacy, Hilary Clinton leading Sanders from growing. If Biden leaves, under the leadership of 20 percentage points, but if he does leave out, the figure is 30.
55% of the Democratic electorate believes that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has dropped from 78% in the last month.
By this yardstick, Biden tävimpänä falls, but for those who voted for him has grown.
When Democratic voters were asked what the candidate is the most important thing, however, they raised the voice vote tettävyyden ahead.
Last month, either one Democrat kandidaattia or possible kandidaattia were not considered impossible for a candidate to the voters.
The Democrats or the potential to perform well in certain key issues among their party's voters.
For the most part to Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, trustworthy and strong leaders.
Biden faring kolmikosta best, in all honesty, while Clinton's strength is the quality of leadership.
30% of Democratic voters say that they dislike Clinton as honest and trustworthy, which is twice as much as Sanders - 15%, while 27% said that they do not have an opinion of Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically agree.
When you look at all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters say that they do not have an opinion of Sanders.
While Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server his foreign minister raises more questions, the vast majority of the Democratic electorate is satisfied with his explanation of the issue and says that the issue affected their overall opinion of him.
The thing is different, however, when you look at America as a whole.
About half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, and only about a third is satisfied.
The people of divided opinion in March, shortly after the matter came to light.
The majority of Americans say that the e-mail controversy affected their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36% say that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six in 10 Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has changed for the worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters see him as honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters, only 32 percent viewed him as honest and trustworthy, and that figure has dropped 8 percentage points in the last month as well as 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that they dislike Clinton as honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of registered voters across the country are either not Trumpia as honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trumpia is seen as good leaders.
Six kandidaatista Biden, Carson and Bush in this study are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders, is generally regarded as an honest broker, but many have no opinion of him, neither Carson nor.
The margin of error in the study, involving 351 Democratic voters, is 6 percentage points.

Five Brotherhood members accused of the death of a first-year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a student died Brotherhood mobbing ceremony in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, the murder charge has been brought against five people.
In New York City's Baruch College, University of Pichincha Delta PSI Brotherhood members were brutally attacked by Chun "Michael" Deng during riitin membership in September 2013, and then took her to the hospital carrying her, thus contributing, his death, police said.
Authorities say that Deng's eyes were more than 13 kilos and his back was loaded backpack full of sand in the country when he tried to walk, after which he was repeatedly takla jäisen Pello cross towards goal.
In the end, Deng complained that her head hurts, after which he lost consciousness.
Brotherhood members are phone number is Deng's pyörryt contact, but allegedly waited hours before that brought him to the hospital, police said.
They had time to Deng's clothes, her symptoms to seek information from the network, as well as to contact the Brotherhood national chairman Andy Meng to ask for this advice, chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
"at this point the members began to hide the ritual equipment and, in effect put Brotherhood chief welfare before Michael Deng," Wagner said.
Deng, not a rebirth of the country, and he died the next morning.
Autopsy, according to the protocol, Deng was repeated blows to the head with a blunt object, the body, and so cavalierly.
"too many families have been affected by the Brotherhood robin, when every year at least one student has died as a result ever since the 1970s," Doug Fialho erberg, Deng, a lawyer representing the family, said in a statement.
People municipalities and their members must be held to account, and this is an important step on the part of the authorities.
Monroe County grand jury advocated that the first five members will receive a third degree murder charges
32 other Brotherhood members, including Mengistu, are also accused of the violent simpu and criminal intrigues.
"we do not want to be responsible only for individuals. If an organisation, which is behind the case, accepted the situation, either formally or informally, they will also be held to account," Wagner said Tuesday at a press conference.

That happens when the Federal Reserve raise interest rates
An interest rate increase will come on the market, and rising rates fall, bond yields will rise and the economy falls into recession.
This we know.
What we don't know is how long all this will take, or how long it lasts.
The past does little to provide assistance on the timing, as it is the economy.
The arrival of the recession has lasted only one day after the first increase in 11 months, sometimes, on the other hand, has gone as long as 86 months.
The aggression of the US Federal Reserve interest-rate nostossa has often, though not always, the defining factor in how the economy and the financial resources to respond.
Therefore, the US Federal Reserve officials have stressed so vigorously that investors should not focus on that, because interest rates are raised, but mainly to the normalisation of the situation of the time trajectory.
The equation is, in fact, a number of variables.
In the end, however, market participants will be able to see that everyone has to raise interest rates once the hössötys has been exaggerated.
"Central Bank the first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some quarters as "cheap money" to the end of an era," said Capital Economics in global affairs chief economic expert Julian Jess HARDOP message to customers.
Instead, we expect that US interest rates to the level of a gradual return to normal, although still low, is a seminal shock that many seem to fear.
This, however, does not mean that it would have an impact.
Below is an overview of how some areas of the economy will react on the basis of previous development:
As has been seen in the market over the last month or so, the expectation of an interest rate increase could make the situation unstable.
When the increase comes from the fact that the impact is not quite so dramatic.
"it seems that capital tuotolla tend to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent poll about what happens after an increase in the central bank.
To be more precise, a rise of around 14% during the last 35 years in the market are generally strong, when approached for an increase of 250 days, then the situation is relatively flat - an average increase of 2.6%, and the normal state is reached after 500 days, with the average yield six 14.4% in the last cycle, told the Nuve leading equity strategist Bob Dollo's recent analysis of the asset management firm, published in Barron's magazine.
Chair, according to Deutsche Bank, the impact on equities is usually clearer increase cycle at a later stage, when profits are starting to fall.
The recession are part of the economy, but interest organizations often promote their arrival.
In the current situation, the central bank is facing a number of challenges that have not previously been, and which could hasten a recession.
This is particularly the gross domestic product, which will be closest to the lowest level ever, before the central bank to raise interest rates.
Since 1950, according to Deutsche Bank predicts 118 nostossa nominal annual GDP has only twice been below 4.5%.
Although the figure was 3.6% in the second quarter of 2015, few believes its permanent advanced by 1.5% in the third quarter, says the federal reserve bank in Atlanta.
Raising interest rates is that the fragile economic architecture can be risky, and raises the question whether "this time is different," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants are prepared for the central bank to increase throughout the year, and all are waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee - Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Although many of the strategic and economic experts believe that the committee cannot accept the increase at this meeting, futures trading suggests the likelihood of only 25%.
"our research shows that every increase cycles since 1950 have occurred so far to increase the leverage of the super cycle, where GDP has overtaken its peak before the recession, very quickly after the recovery has begun," the report says.
On the other hand, now under way has been exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been overwhelming for the longest period at the end of the last recession has had a record 35 months, and now under way is already 74. a month.
Solid gains in volatile market in anticipation of interest rate increases, and the model has also been somewhat reminiscent of observations made on the capital.
The main difference is that the central bank's move, of course, its effects will be seen more quickly than debt books.
Bonds yields trend seems to be changing the cycle for the first increase/cut immediately.
Korotus returns in bonds at the end of the cycle will fall directly on the chair," the Bank said.
Charles Schwab - strategists believe that raising interest rates will lead to longer and shorter time bonds yields convergence, by the way, the yield curve.
High yield bonds are often better in such a situation, although "we are still wary of the search," said Schwab fixed yield analyst Kathy Jones in the analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of the Central line.
"the strength of the dollar and inflation expectations, the bill also contains a number of signs that the markets have adapted to tighter monetary policy outlook," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more equal, lending margins have increased and volatility has increased - all these are characterised by the market at a time when the central bank has tightened his policy framework.
In general, companies, whose business is largely in the United States, win, when interest rates are rising and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies, which have a lot of debt, fare worse, with a rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on world markets and financing their debt more expensive than what they have.
"History shows that the 'quality' shares are generally more lucrative for the first interest rate hike after three months," Goldman Sachs analysts said customers for its report.
The companies, which have a strong turnover, over the low turnover companies since 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases on average by five points.
Shares of companies with high returns and low volatility of capital, businesses were performing better than the lower quality of the latter; the former was an average of 4 percentage points to 3 percentage points."
The debt is going to be a big problem.
Those companies that have a lot of variable rate debt, are losing the most," Goldman said.
Outside speculation, consumers will be able to benefit from the rise in the value of the dollar.
Also, savers will be able to make a profit as a result of higher profits, although experts disagree about how quickly the impact is being felt.

B & Q boss says that eastern Europeans are working on the cheap labour are the men behind the popularity
British men are increasingly using the assistance services, Veronique the Harding says
Behind the rise in the number of professional men from Eastern Europe
As a result, aimed at professional men and screwball fix - shops will be opened up to 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher turns 60 B & Q shops across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent of the Daily Mail newspaper
The British state and its renunciation of the hammers and paint pensseleist palkkaava's rather adept at Eastern Europeans working men to do the home renovation work
It seems to me that if you are clever with the hammer or beaten to paint the walls, you are in the minority.
The British, in fact, hire more help for men to carry out DIY work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind the B & Q.
Kodin renovation chain owned by Kingfisher's new chief executive Veronique the Harding said that is behind the popularity of skilled labour from Eastern Europe in the number of men, and that they are offering their services on the cheap.
As a result, Kingfisher's plans to open 200 new jobs for men screwball fix - trade and close to 60 B & Q shop.
The Harding said that she wants more women to work as B & Q stores, eight out of 10 in the purchase decision is made by the more beautiful sex.
Today, the majority of the staff is male.
He said that among the changes must be taken into account: One woman is more economies, with more home renovation work done today than in the past.
The Harding said: "most myymälöidemme staff is still male.
We must seek a better balance.
However, half of our clients are women, and 80% of purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women have a big role in the decision-making process."

Trendin a screwball fix - and B & Q shops owned Kingfisher is opening up to 200 new movement
Three ässän government decided to resort to force the legislation to save the country's economy.
The visual effects were rather quickly.
The sharp end of the organisations at the centre of the Unions and other employees began forcing straight away and, as a result, the country stands on Friday because of a protest by workers.
The time in the eyes of many, it also stands to reason.
Asked whether the right to strike, when it is going badly.
It even created the resistance movement.
More than 50,000 people in the net has already announced that it will not take part in the demonstration, but it works.
In the old days a good consensus about this sort of thing would have been impossible.
Of course, there was nothing nettiä, where protest, but openly declared as a culprit would have been political suicide for a small man.
Millions of member unions to protest a couple of ten thousand people, there is a lot of interest, but it gives pause for thought.
The role of the union movement is no longer so obvious than even 20 years ago.
All of us do not feel ownership of the objectives of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of interest in the activities of the movement's violent solutions can also see a woman as a gift from heaven.
For years at a time when things are shown rullaav to on their own, so now, at last, unions can be reached on the matter: Defending workers' rights, visibly and properly.
The government can do what it wants to be a prisoner of the role of the trade union movement, when union membership is perhaps more and more necessary.
There are organisations doing what anyone thinks it is nonsense that Friday's protest somehow stop in Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has fallen to 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product is still falling and unemployment is rising.
These things should make all of the decisions.

University as part of the savings to begin negotiations on the whole staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million a year.
In practice, this means a reduction of about 130 workers.
The operation aims to save a further two million.
The Yt negotiations behind the budget for 2016, which anticipated the operation itself to be 8.5 million deficit.
It will also affect the budget cuts made by the government.
University during this account will result in a deficit of about 2.6 million.
Costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time, the Department to get the funding will fall by 2 million and other funding to the tune of EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is around 85 million euros, so the savings target is 10% of the entire budget.
The combination of massive cuts in education and research, as well as the loss of corporate funding of our universities is very important," says Rector Anneli Pauli in a university release.
The impact of the cuts before the summer seemed to come from a moderate, but the loss of additional funding now appear in the new perspective.
The shop steward of the negotiations with the launch on Tuesday of next week and will last for six weeks by the law.
YLE: Onnibus wants the Finnish railways
Halpabussi company Onnibus's owner, British Sir Brian Souter says Ylelle that rail is also aimed at the company in Finland.

The Federal Reserve must make decisions about interest rates
The rest of the world will be watching from the sidelines, when the Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday and Thursday for two days to make a decision about whether they will raise interest rates, and for the first time in nearly a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists for a little more than half of those who still believed in the last week of the central bank raising interest rates, now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates will be kept at the current 0 to 0.25 per cent level.
This is a historic event, because the central bank has cut interest rates to zero, is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has a chance to get away from the zero level and start the normalisation of interest rates," said Angel de Ubi, Peterson Insti support Economics Fellow of the Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has performed relatively well, and the recovery has brought the balance sheets of trillions of dollars, and created a little bit of inflation.
The central bank cannot ignore global prospects are less rosy.
It has warned the market that they will be ready nostoon, but signs show they also believe that the alternatives are against an increase.
The decision will be made public on Thursday at 8 p.m. [CTE].
Delta State University's marksman left an apology message
Cow after tyttöystävänsä in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting her colleagues later in the day - Shannon lamb wrote a message in which he said he "regrets" the first murder and hoped, "that would be able to cancel it," authorities said on Tuesday.
Mississippi's Walter told the police that the Delta State University geography and social sciences teacher lamb phoned the emergency number is around 10 in the morning
On Monday, and said that he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send nuances apeleita into her house.

University Rector William La forge said that between lamb and Schmidt to know she had any kind of conflict, but that "clearly lamb had something in mind."
Authorities said Tuesday that despite the allegations published on Monday that lamb would have believed the most Prentis was in relation to Mr Schmidt, did not have "any information or evidence of any sort of "tripartite relationship."
Shawn O' Steen said that with the most Prentis married for about seven years and described him as "a good person.
A couple from 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O' Steen said that since he and Prentis was a 19 year-old daughter, who is "shocked."
O' Steen told that Prentis's and her daughter were "clearly the best friends."

When the police won by lamb Highway 1 near Greenville, later that same evening, lamb stopped their car and left by the wayside, leaving it to run in the woods, where they shot themselves.
Lamb argued educational science from Delta State in the spring of 2015, says the university website the CV.
The Stars, who lost his appeal
Protected [left], when his son Redmond, Washington's with [right], it has been tough in recent years.
In 2001 he had leukemia, and his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, who died of cancer in 2009.

All this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months because of a broken neck
Luke Shaw received double fractured right foot by Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Although defender was in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw would play again this season.
The injury was caused by the reckless taklaus by Hector Moreno, 15 minutes after the 20 year-old Shaw had surged into the PSV.
He was 9 minutes on the pitch and he had to be given oxygen before hospital.
Van Gaal said: "he is wearing a double fracture and he is now in hospital."
He transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then cut in Manchester.
This is awful. The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, and after suffering difficulties playing brilliantly, and now this happens.
When I was at happinaamari pukuhuoneessa, he was on the ground.
She cried.
I am not a doctor, but the double fracture will take at least six months, and he is not playing the group phase.
I hope that he will be able to play in this period.
Moreno was lucky d'honneur, when he received a red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli was not punished the Mexican players.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian made mistakes.
You can judge for themselves the situation when I say that it was shot and the red card.
It was really bad two pedestrians taklaus.
Shaw twiittasi: "Thank you for all your messages, words are not enough to tell us how disappointed I am that my recovery begins now, come back stronger."
Issue: Manchester United suffer Luke Shaw's case and will lose to the PSV
As an added incentive, the English puolustajalla recovery in the European Championships in France next June.
The PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "it is a really bad injury."
If a player is out because of an injury, all of which are very sad.
Pelaa never our intention to offend an adversary.
Moreno's leg broke, when he played for the Mexican team Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup against Holland.
"Moreno takes this seriously, because it is not intended to hurt the opponent and hears that the injury is really bad, it is bad," Cocu said.
I have seen in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball, which was moving in a different direction, so it seemed like he [Moreno] would be unaffected by this decision, but I have seen Luke taklausta.
Moreno said SBS 6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this thing can be.
I feel horrible for this reason, I am so sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also hospitalised after Chris Smalling's challenge him.
Surely David Cameron knows Lora report this better?
Every parent learns about one thing: If your child loves something about a book that does not last for too long before it learns almost outside.
But then, if you are David Cameron.
When the holiday period to provide child care services asked his favourite of the Prime Minister's trap, he chose Dr Seuss's The Lora x - a book, published in 1971, the story of environmental protection.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes Super Camps - in a message published on the website of the company and to continue: "funny, touching, creative and sends out a very strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children, because it always seems to be present an image or message that we have seen in the past."
All this is true, but the following paragraph, where Cameron supposedly describes the wiles of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, with new figures and details were added in a relatively short space of the original text on which they are written.
"the tar inside the walls of the city, where all nature is lost and even the air is a commodity, Ted - the boy in hopes of winning over the heart of the girl of his dreams by Audrey's desire to see a real tree," the text says, and describes the love story, written by Dr Seuss, the right name Theodor Seuss Geisel died in 1991, no.
If this is not yet enough suspect that Cameron's text sounds in places than it would have been on the Internet Movie database to website expertise from Lora x, a summary of the plot of the film, which begins as follows: "the tar inside the walls of the city, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, Ted's son hopes of winning over Audrey - the heart of the girl of his dreams."
Given that Cameron has publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so infallible book rightist. This anonymous young boy learns how to beat the local natural greed has destroyed, trees and tarvik kutova Kerska, ignoring the story of these lands in the name of concise, viiksekkää oliosta Lora xista, who "speaks for the trees."
This relatively invisible PR job is probably outsourced assistant, who has apparently never read the book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said that the text will become Cameron's constituency office.
Super Camps confirmed that the text was Cameron's staff, but has not commented on the matter at the time either.
Adam Lyth was clearly the wayside in the England team, but it was still a hard place
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a hard task, but when you see what kind of team England have chosen touring worldwide, I do not believe that the recurrence of recent times, losing 3 - 0 series is on the cards.
I would vierasvoitto either out of the equation.
Alastair Cook half may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but it is part of the cycle of good lyöjiä and team mentality is strong: They have no scars from 2012, only the youthful positiivisuutta.
Moe of Ali develops spiral syötöissä and Adil Rashid is the aggressor option, although it is the unknown factor at this level.
On the subject: Adam Lyth tippui England cricket team, as his place of Alex
The decision leaves Adam Lyth team is understandably difficult to analyse for me, because I am his päävalmentaja in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against invaders in challenging circumstances, and simple, but the harsh reality is that cricket players are judged on the basis of their results.
Joe Root's choice, for example, did not have any uncertainty factors before the note, because, as I said before, players are the best choice.
About 100 basis points more, and Lyth's NHL team could go on, but he was personally responsible for their own destiny.
Hopefully if he gets more juoksuja Yorkshire, for another opportunity to arise.
England päävalmentaja Trevor Baylis's praised Lyth's attitude, even when he is not performed quite as well as they could have, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It is difficult to answer this question, how long lyöjä must mark the exclusion.
Lyth was seven times maajoukkueeseen, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected by the ninth.
Only Compton got the chance to play, both at home and with Santa.
Our only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott's first to the Caribbean, when Lyth was in tip-top condition, but it is a missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex of comes in, and it is lyöjä which I appreciate.
In her is something that we saw in Yorkshire cricket pelaajana early in this period, when he took 236 points against us River Trent Bridge on the ground.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this of course depends on the composition of a team in the United Arab Emirates.
The ball has been the idea Moe of the typing opening alongside Cook, when on the field get extra syöttäjä but get the four fast, and I am not against this.
I do not understand why lyöjä could beat out there, and this vasenkätinen has already shown itself to be a cricket player.
Moe kolmonen of county municipality in Worcestershire, but he has not done the job for them, and there is not much difference.
My old joukkuekaveri Justin Langer played the first 38 games first hilan dropped in, before moved avaukseen in 2001.
As soon as he did three hundred points or muis has in the past.
Zafar Ansari will team up for a syöttäjä, and what little contact I had with him, he seems to be very impressive young man.
People can watch his unvarnished statistics - banging on average 31, 35 with the ball - and think that it is a gamble, but there is not too much into descriptions and the electorate opted for young people.
He learns a lot on Tour.
Team outside England, appears to be a few harsh words with the coach.
Sri Lankans in the appointment of Jay award of lyöjän Ma hela konsultiksi games can prove neronleim aukseksi.
He is one of the most comfortable kavereista of the game, and brings with it a huge amount of experience, because everything is done in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in white ball games, and brings energy and a ruthless streak.
I always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, was then playing or valmentamista, and he has the same advantage as älliä Mahe lalla.
Sometimes the new voices pukuhuoneessa can rejuvenate a team, even though their message would be the same as in the past.
Coll, the joukkuekaveri from Durham, Ben Stoke - the one the Root, were given a similar break against Australia, and I certainly have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, sports coaches and chose not to.
And we must remember that just as players, their work depends on the outcome.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
The departure of Britain from the EU [Brexit] are able to carry the day, if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-hearted renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are growing by the day's problems, even if it is not to be taken into account even a hearty Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn's election to the leadership of the Labour Party or the unions' of angry about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat crony recently explained that, because the EU is so deep and various crises, all of which are not the fault of its own, some Member States are tired of Britain itself, a key agenda is full of friction causing concessions and disruptive changes to the agreement, which, for the most part, these countries do not want.
At the annual meeting of the Confederation of trade unions in Brighton decided that it does not want them, if they are corrosive of social protection.
Although we could call it a selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer behind schedule by summits or in foreign capitals on bilateral meetings, take a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument of local worthies either with or without him, and then come home, in other words, to win support for the reforms.
It is all about me.
European kaverini outward-looking Britain to the EU, which wants to enter the tent - "Do not leave us alone with the French," says Berlin - suggests that certain capitals most shortsighted ministers and officials have now reached a point that they do not care about our ice then our source.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is cautious and moderate ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his post before it goes by in the same way as Thatcher who was staying too long for the 11 years, [14] to Mitterrand and Kohl [16].
French President François Hollande has faced re-election or replacement in 2017.
He, too, has the power away.
Poland may soon be the right-wing nationalist government, the Spanish leftist.
It is difficult to see these countries self-sacrifice mass selfie on behalf of the British people, when their energy would rather go to prevent it, not the source of Scotland from the UK - they do not want to do the same for the sake of their own separatist tendencies.
So, to my friends, some of these ministers can even design deliberately making pointless comments of the Scottish National Party of Great Britain during the referendum campaign the year 2017 Brexit - accelerate the process.
"the negotiations were conducted story" and "the negotiations did not make any difference to Britain."
The Europeans have bitter experience, how all-consuming's Fleet Street by the press can be and how the EU sceptical press alone Autocrats are, what they were inspired by Tony Benn at the time of the 1975 referendum on our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed in the ratio of 2: 1.
They can dim view to remember most of the Euro's opportunist, Boris Johnson, who made a name for itself by "direct bananas to the EU in Brussels correspondent in the early nineties.
Ed Miliband was probably silly, but at least he knew, who were his enemy.
They belonged to the Run, telephones, hakkeroi foreigners and people from a diverse range of taxes, whose registered office is nominally elsewhere and who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair, in fact, thought of them exactly the same, but realised that if you are in a cage with a craving gorillan, bananas must abandon a smokescreen for the sake of it, unless you want to be on the list of gorillan lunch and dinner later.
In fact, Miliband was Blairinos' ila more than Blair himself, as far as Cameron's renegotiation to oppose the stunt. Miss, had accepted the principle behind the EU rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus allowing Blair to get out of the situation.
The press did not give him either never apologise.
But like Jeremy Corbyn, who applauded me gently in the back of the Westminster Parliament house on Monday - I said to him that he has no time to waste on me], it seems likely to take over from Neil Kinnock in the 1980s boycott of Murdoch, the strategy, which was a mistake, both then and now.
Although it may take some time, however, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in contact with the media. Not on me, but I have no doubt that Andrew M. BBC sohvalta Corbyn went on Sunday.
Corbyn's official status in Europe is, to put it mildly, is evolving.
He says that we would like to see a permanent reform in the EU.
Well, the vast majority of the people of the United Kingdom Independence Party's war paint - intoilun, as well as the Conservative Party's wilder outside the small nationalist can be sure to stand behind this opinion.
Hilary Benn, Benn, Benn fan" but not "said that in both radio and TV this week, when his internal partiolaisen would have liked to admit that the election of Mr Corbyn appoints karski, John McDonnell, the shadow cabinet minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70 chapters, when his isäpappa pinnis Artists TV in trying to be disloyal to his colleagues in the Labour government without having to go so far, however, that the government would lose the case.
Hilary's pinnistely were more attractive.
But the fight for it to remain involved in Benn's utterance of "any situation" - was not what McDonnell said, and by all accounts what Corbyn told the makeshift stretcher and elected representatives in a private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever it is less hierarchical, emotional and personal image, which Corbyn wants to remember that he even concerned me," communications discipline is important in an era of 24-hour TV, and social media in particular and the Stars, which is a fertile breeding ground for vainoharh to fraud and trickery.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair to Cameron for ilmaislippu on Europe by allowing him to keep the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins, at least, thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic equivocation on EU membership - and therefore their Benn intellectual regulated economy in line with its past and antikapitalisti] is no longer just an esoteric debate among the dissidents of the left, for whom the central dogma of the narcissism of small differences in opillisissa niceties.
As far as his dual isuuteensa about NATO's Tom Watson is convinced that shooting Corby campaign, in order to give foreign diplomats have just to try to explain it to the superiors.
Why Paris or Berlin would waste political capital - they even have a sceptical electorate - concessions for Britain, while it may be entirely superfluous?
The United States has been somewhat disappointed by the weakness of the British military out of Iraq, Libya and Syria, even under the Conservative government cutting costs, such as the British Influence Security Forum on Monday reminded me of the Security Forum aloituksessa.
Experts criticise sähkötupakka assessment by Public Health England
Scientists have said that the state's funding of the agency's claim that the electricity tupakat are 95% less harmful than traditional, started 12 of the spirit of the meeting, which had links to the tobacco industry.
The British Medical Journal, writing in the BMJ, experts shared Lancet to criticism of the evidence used by the PHE report by Public Health England electric tobacco.
PHE published this "milestone" in its report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review" of the evidence."
Several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data, however, and referred to the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
Medical magazines journal Lancet published last month in the main article, which attacked the main conclusion of the PHE against "unusually shaky ground.
The other two have pondered whether the allegations," the researchers wrote in the BMJ built rock or sand."
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, School of Public Health professor Martin McKee, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, Simon Cape, saying: "the main principle is that policies should be based on the evidence for the effectiveness of public health."
They say that the public's expectation of PHE's assertion that "the current best estimate electric tupakat are around 95% less harmful than traditional tupakat" is based on a detailed assessment of the evidence and Alp-net.
In fact, it will be one of 12 meeting, where a decision analysis model was developed by several criteria - MCD A syntetis the disadvantages of their opinions, which is associated with a range of products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting were intensified research.
McKee and Cape, saying that one of the meeting sponsoreista sweet Euro Swiss Health, told by the CEO of the company had previously received funding for an independent study of the American Tobacco company Bris tish.
He also supported the ATO's public health mandate sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people reported that funding for the electronic cigarette manufacturer, but no funding for it, which he reportedly received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International in the past, they add.
The criteria for the selection of the members of the panel were not reported, but the panel is one of a number of well-known electronic cigarette supporters, some of whom also tell the study received funding for the sector.
Others present were not known for their expertise in tobacco control again.
The meeting was also the director of PHE's tobacco.
A study produced by the group's "expressive, admits that "there is a lack of "undoubted evidence on harm in the majority of products and the majority of the criteria, McKee and Cape, write.
Any of these links or limitations, however, does not mention the PHE's report.
McKee and Cape, PHE's claims saying that "so far there is no evidence that sähkötupakka works route the incineration of children or not - of a smoker at" is premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE's director of health and well-being, says that the allegations raised in the BMJ has been in the past.
He says: "Electric tupakat are considerably less harmful than smoking."
Half of its lifetime burning die from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue investigating the long-term impact.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence looks like and what it does not seem likely, especially when compared with the relative dangers to tobacco is so much less public awareness.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking related disease and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - although electric tupakat disadvantages are not risk free, they are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we meet our national responsibility.
The BBC would do well to dispense with EastEnders', says former head of Channel 4
The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop programmes such as EastEnders or sending The Voice, and that commercial competitors' to whatever 'hiteistä such as this saga of Albert Square - in the street, for example.
Johnson said that the licence fees should be used only for projects that other British broadcasters do not.
He criticised the BBC for having put in the public service under the programs, which probably has a smaller audience, difficult to broadcast hours rivals believe most programmes against and 4 for the channels such as the BBC.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall said the company wants to do more work with other organisations, Johnson said that he came to Channel 4 in the past six years to establish a relationship with the BBC, to no avail.
"I do not understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts, which clearly fit for subsidized competitors," Johnson said in the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its research on the future of the BBC.
If fees are kept - and I am not sure that it would be this message melle or a good idea in the long term - it should at least be limited to production in such programmes that are imported and others are not.
The Voice is sent to the main broadcasting time, support for the future because it is designed to collect as much as possible.
The idea that anyone would take this program is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why it is a regressive tax to fund programs that could also be funded without state aid.
The Voice is one of EastEnders, the second, admittedly, taken inside the house.
Frankly, other channels to do anything about it.
I do not understand how it is transmission of public service.
I do not believe that it would undermine the BBC at all."
The Channel 4: Between 2004 and 2010, led by serial entrepreneur, Johnson said that the BBC is guilty of "hunting in viewer numbers as a result of the goals of the people who work there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He comments on the popular BBC television series resemble the former Sky boss Tony Ball comments. He used the Mac Taggart luentonsa in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC would sell such suites than EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's public service programmes on a smaller audience" is going to get to the BBC 4, which often cannot be measured, but the BBC to fulfil their responsibilities and can then royalty revenue of £4 billion in defence of hypocrisy, saying, "Of course, we are doing all these unknown programs, which no one thought."
They put they broadcast the scene, which no one will ever see them.
Royalties on Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in it, who will get the most value from it.
Of course, you all think we all think that £150 a year will get a lot in return, but I do not know whether it is true for those people for whom £150 is big money, because they do not use much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5's leader David El Palace, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should rethink its Reith's short-term mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said that only a small part of the BBC's output to classify these days of training - he said the figures of 1% and 0.1% on the radio and TV production - and that it should take a leaf from the Australian and Canadian broadcasting and change to "inform, educate and entertain."
Questions regarding the partnership, El Palace said that the BBC should focus more on the events such as concerts, whom he met only with someone on television, and an alliance with commercial companies, so that all these were online.
"Sonic genetics allows for the management of the brain cells using sound waves

The golden rule of eight student hostel living
Eleven years have passed since ignorance of the other students at the age of 19 - asuntolaan. Then still believed in the District and moral relativism, but only now I remember the flesh of people forced smiles and numerous, lengthy complaints from others.
A large part of the curriculum I can be boiled down to a simple rule to eight.
Changing asuntolaan can be quite daunting for any of the nerves.

The university is a tough place introver to you.

It can mean a hell for someone who is trying to relax.
Nothing in this culture does not give you permission to say 'I like you, and I want to be friends with you, but you must leave now that I am able to recover the costs of energy in my conversations with you."
Trying to sense when a student chap is tired of the socialisation - and maybe send text messages instead of knocking the door.

One type of student hostel I was of the opinion that if the door was not locked, he was invited in.
He saw some of the stories.

Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter of capital to the timely new book, "Marx is worth a look."
The global economic crisis are brought to the surface of the Karl Marx 1818 - 1883 and his capital of the book published in 1867 - 1894, writes a former chairman of the SKP known George Hakanen today published the book of Marx capital topicality.
"he will be taken more seriously now than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his speech.
Marx's analysis of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalization of the invasion and more widely in all areas of life, the concentration of capital and financial capital and the growing role of fictitious capital have proved to be remarkably far-sighted.
Agaricus organized by its capital - the author of a book on the list of seminars is also a professor at Aalto University, a respected economic technicians Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx is relevant "now and forever."
Surely the former executive director of the Institute of business and industry, however, is not Marxist?
Not after all.
Korkman says on the phone, he does not like Marx topical economic ajattelijana but rather as interesting as a social theorist.
Today the social sciences have differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary connoisseurs.
"the common perception is that aatehistoria says Korkman false opinions of dead men," to begin.
The fact of the matter is that Marx's predictions went drastically wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial revolution, he pulled capitalism began far too time-consuming conclusions, Korkman chews.
But Korkman, however, sees the value in a radical stance in Marx.
"relevant of Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now under discussion, on the other hand, Marx's interest as wealth distribution.
"Marx may provide inspiration for who wants to understand the big picture, as a result of the technological revolution is changing the world," Korkman analyzed.
But then, what should the government decide tomorrow, does not come from Marx.
In his view, he was a hopeless case of capitalism, which should just stop.
Yet Marx to support Korkman's eyes look.
"Marx in the 1970s was not able to read," says Korkman.
"Maoist, Trotskyist and other sects would hate all of capitalism, but even more with each other."
Today, the debate is more varied and also Marx can be approached without back years of ideological and political baggage.
"every social scientist should read Marx in their veins - as other klassikoihin', says Korkman.

Across Finland local demonstrations will be held on Friday.
Friday's protests is exceptional in many ways - muistatko these strikes and demonstrations?
A big demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is in many ways an interesting and unusual.
For example, it found a very good benchmark for the Finnish political history, sociology professor emeritus at the University of Jyväskylä says Martti Siis ant.
No wonder, then, that the protest movement.
If it does not do so, it would face a government hands up, Siis ant says.
A right-wing government has struck at the heart of the tradition of the Finnish corporatism points - and also those points have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
There are no harsh government contract law.
This is a great deal of the fact that the business is really trying to get to their knees.
At the same time, the movement is in the mirror to the place.
The mirror is needed, for example, that the movement is by no means all employees to support the Friday protests.
What is new is the sharp division, whose protests get amongst it, which the business community would like to take part in the demonstration.
Gathered around the Finnish people demonstrated at the parliament house in November 1993.
If Friday's protests, is looking for a reference point, could it be unemployed left the demonstration, held in 1993 Murros Thursday, Siis ant says.
In the midst of the deepest recession in Murros Thursday gathered together 20 000 unemployed.
Esko, [and] the government stumble from one crisis to another in the labour market.
It has been said that the Finnish government and employee organisations to have ever been as bad as, during the course of the bourgeois governments.
Relations between the government and the trade union movement are perhaps even worse than Murros times on Thursday.
Moreover, the power is now very bourgeois governments ever, Siis ant says.
The current coalition government is more interesting in the way that it is so tight right wing of the True Finns Party, despite the rhetoric.
Yet the jytkyn time was certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected on Friday.
Protests also halted public transport and possibly closing nurseries and schools.
Despite protests from employees of indivisible support, it could become the largest in many years.
Helsinki has in recent years held a demonstration of about 300 per year.
They are from one end of the spectrum to the other.
Traditionally in the Finnish trade union movement has been relatively peaceful demonstrations - even though the policies have been heightened in recent years.
Traditionally the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, are law-abiding.
The protesters are trying to avoid harm or destruction of property, Siis ant says.
The end of the 1990s, however, brought a new impetus.
Mielenosoitus culture has changed.

Media researcher: Sipilä is taking a big risk
Sipilän says there is a need for diversified channels of communication, and the Prime Minister's speech on television and radio are one channel among others.
Also, this kind of direct speech, the channel will be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time stay, Sipilä told reporters Swedish Parliament.
Sipilä, did not want to assess how frequent the way the Prime Minister comes from television and radio.
According to the Sipilän rhetoric does not necessarily always ignored the officious channels in the future.
If other channels to the channel, so we will see then.
Now use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
Sipilän Finland's economic situation is so serious that it requires the speech on television and radio for the public.
This issue we are talking about here, is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
Which is why we came to this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast at 9.05 p.m - 9.20 in both TV1 and Radio Finland.
It can also watch YLE Areenassa.
Sipilä is taking a big risk
Media researcher hopes that Sipilän televised speech about the more general government of inward-looking.
The definition of a public debate on whether to take justice into their own hands more firmly and refuse from the public debate? Is looking at Stockholm University Professor spike Koivunen.
The Foreign Minister Timo Soini recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and not allow it to define themselves.
In the name of democratic debate and the public in the hope that these things are not connected.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is outraged Sipilän announcement.
It would be odd if the media field, does not react to it.
Political communication Styles not reporting things in a democracy.
It is up to the representatives of the media seeking a definition that politicians agendoja takes as given.
Koivusen said in a televised speech Sipilä for a big risk.
Sipilän should bring something new to the table and, in particular, in order for the speech set exceptionally high expectations would be met.
There is today more of what we already have?
Or whether he is able to speak in a different tone, a different way of saying something new or different words?
Koivunen says that if there is just more of the same old thing, you have to wonder why it was such a great gesture and YLE gave it an exceptional time.
YLE also take this risk in the sense that if it is not a specific situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that YLE branded meksi on politicians or a Member of Parliament and the government's message, which is certainly not edifying interests or in line with the general line.
Sipilä from subtle appeal
Sipilän forthcoming speech is important, but also what the Prime Minister left unsaid, a media researcher points out.
The evening will see exactly what Sipilä is missing and what not, says the research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä Heikki Kuutti.
Kuutin says in a TV speech Sipilä from subtle appeal, because this will bring out its own vision without the commotion.
So the message to the public without the filter of journalism, unlike at a briefing, where reporters can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypass the media and speak directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media interpreted by the speech does not get something wrong, because of unspecified issues.
Kuutin says is very important, how Sipilä appears on the TV - will do sweat, tremble on their hands.
He compare Sipilää is the father figure, who now tells people what needs to be done.
If Sipilä knows how to put their house in order, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government any information about something, because this man, as if talking directly to another person.
- US President Barack Obama and their partners on a regular basis.
Truly exceptional
Political scientist Erkka crevasse to the Prime Minister's speech to the public truly exceptional.
He said that no such thing has happened over the past few decades, and that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
An exceptional time requires extraordinary means, crevasse says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister is so keen to get the Finns who are receptive to face fierce adjustments.
Palkansaaja organisations are organising demonstrations and strikes against the actions of the government on Friday.
The Left Alliance chairman Paavo Arhinmäki says Twitter that Sipilä could keep his speech on the state of the nation speech at the Prime Minister's announcement of the Swedish Parliament to discuss too.
The SPD chairman Antti Rinne [,] again to announce its challenging Sipilän dialogue.
Now is not the time of logeille.

Psychologist advises: So tell the children of refugees
Many parents have had over the last couple of days to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees trying to Europe.
Or does it say anything?
It does not need to force the issue, a member of the Crisis Group of SPRU, psychologist Ferdinand, Off advises.
The smaller children alone is worth protecting, for example, and not let them watch the news.
Small children are not always able to understand rolling their eyes, and it can stay in the mind and depression, he says.
If the child is, however, a television news images of refugees or heard about it from the outside, it is worth taking up.
The debate is a good thing to hold the child's background and listen carefully to what he asks.
A child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones that parent thinks of his fear.
The baby does not intimidate in vain, despite the haunting and pelottaisi itself.
The smaller the child is closely following their parents' behaviour.
If the parents themselves to remain calm during the debate, the child feels safe.
The children are confronted with the debate with refugees likely school, boys' or the net.
Parenting is a good thing to raise the matter with them if that preoccupies the baby.
Fact is that every person in the world to do things well.
Parents with children to think about how our family dealt with this.
Whether it is in our view of the world at the end of the day, however, safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different views on education - some people may want to protect their children as much as possible fear.
On the other hand, if the family also talks about the difficult issues, the child will be a model for how to deal with future problems for life.
This can be very helpful to him in the future.
Sosiaalipsykologi Janne Viljamaa: "teach your child to help poorer."

According to Cook, Apple's removal of the programmes is a more complex issue than off it.
Some applications is linked to another in an iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems elsewhere on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications are working closely together with other programmes.
There are other programs that do not work that way.
So, with time, I believe that we will be able to develop a way to allow the user to remove them," Cook added.
Cook said that Apple is looking at this, because the company does not want to waste storage space for users of iPhone puhelimista.

The US Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy
In the United States following the recession starts fast at less than a year, but the more within three years after the country's central bank, the Fed will again take a long time to raise interest rates.
And the decline of the financial markets will, in turn, before the next recession.
For the Fed to begin raising interest rates, possibly as early as this week, and at the latest by the end of the year.
So the next recession can print run at the quickest rate rytinä before it by this autumn and the financial markets.
Or so, at least, is what happens if the world's biggest economy and the financial markets function as they have been used - and if they react to the Federal Reserve monetary crunch blackmail as they have done in the past.
Such conclusions are arrived at the German bank Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid and Nick Burns and Seb Barker of the London market research on a large long-term study of market and economic cycles.
The bank distributors of over 60 pages long - the near-collapse of the asset Return Study - a research report last week for the international big customers.
Research and report produced by strategists do not pretend to know exactly when the Fed starts to raise interest rates to or what happens after the economy and markets.
Instead, they present the facts of economic statistics cool and through its calculations, how the economy and the markets have behaved in the past and after the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at the time.
Historical observations, but they are, what are the key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or a different model than in the past to raise interest rates at the time - and what might follow.
It is clear that the economy as well as the financial markets are now more shaky in order to withstand higher interest rates than at any time in the past since the 1950s.
At the start of the recession, perhaps not even years
The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve of its respective virityksestä choose leaders throughout last summer and early autumn to insinuate that the time will be ripe for interest rates nostoon.
For the first time in more than nine years in interest rates could come as early as this week.
The issue will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday, when Federal Reserve Board so-called avomarkkinakomitea meets to decide on two, in their meeting.
The last time the Fed raised the so-called Fed transfunds - its interest rates in June 2006.
Then came exactly two years relatively regular but by one small series of interest rate increases, which the Fed raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage point to 1.25% to 5.25%.
Financial markets oireilu began in 2007 in the United States in the risky mortgage financing difficulties, and a year later the financial crisis repesi global doomsday nightmare.
The great recession came in 2009.
The last time the financial markets and the real economy serious setbacks began at a slower rate than in the past, after the Federal Reserve interest rate hike is typically the case.
Similarly afflictions were then harsher and karumpi than any time since the 1930s depression.
Deutschen strategists have screened the largest economies in the world rises and bills as well as financial market developments since the 1950s, and in some places, ranging from the beginning of the 19th century.
Federal Reserve interest rate increases and their economic and fiscal impact they make an account since the 1950s.
After the start of the recession is the first interest rate hike at the quickest time in less than a year, usually less than three years and, on average, less than three and a half years.
The rise in the exchange rate of the financial markets will be closed within two years - since the Federal Reserve interest rate hike.
By the turn of the Fed has raised its interest rates since the beginning of the 1950s and turn down a dozen different stages of the cycle.
Each time has in some respects each other, and times is considered relatively scarce, so they can hardly have any certainty about the effects of the next interest rate hike.
Strategists are a reminder that this time, many things have changed.
Not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
Key causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits may not necessarily be indisputably discovered even decades of research work.
But the three points from the crisis and its destructive power increased reasons may be somewhat indisputably clear:
1 The Fed, euro zone, the ECB and other major central banks in the world in the 21st century its leading rates too low for too long.
They place a techno bubble scent, and at the same time, the following.
2] to various parts of the financial and real economy that has accumulated over the decades, and already excessive debt rose over the impact of loose monetary policy of the central banks even bigger.
Was it the greatest velkakupla crisis-management economic history.
3] Those financial economy near pidäk hash bags got mad cheap debt financing in the areas of the financial markets for most major fluctuations in economic history at the crisis-management bubbles shares, property, bonds and commodities.
It is unlikely there will be very hard to dispute that the rise of increasingly complex of soaring heap of debt leverage, financial markets were extraordinarily dangerous and unstable, and in the process, when the Fed and other central banks last drove up interest rates.
Debt vipujen upon the release of financial structures or valuation bubbles as interest rate increases after a certain amount of time after they had begun, and debt financing costs were turned upward.
The risks were realized as the financial crisis, and it was followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutschen strategists are guessing what happens next, but give tuumailu by the subject, for example, the following points:
1 The Fed and other major central banks are now have even more light on the monetary policy even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even longer still lower.
2 The debt is not for a long time been mad as cheap as ten years ago, but now is the cheapest velkaraha are literally cheaper than free.
So the debt load of finance and the real economy is not a burden, but now in different parts of the economy has taken a heavier debt load than before the financial crisis, or for that matter any time in the past.
3 More torrent wiser and less costly central banks issuing the liquidity that has gone largely unnoticed by the financial markets and crystal key to the Securities and expensive omaisuuslaji preceding peak or any time since the financial crisis.
And strategists have tempered the mood, but the warning signs of the financial market, but they also point out that the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and recession of the most burdensome for decades to model than it has in the past.
The eurozone economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak but at the same time, the pressures of the financial markets and the risks are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, the Fed will start to tighten up its monetary taps stronger.
Perhaps the French bank Societe General of strategist Albert Edwards's vision is not as strange as the kkiseltään can make a difference.
He is a long time in the preparation of the Bank of international investor customers following Federal Reserve täyskäännöksi's:
First Fed raises interest rates, then the bubbles burst - and soon, Federal Reserve, it is time to put out financial fires even bigger QE money injected with.

Ahtisaari in the Guardian: The West rejected a Russian proposal for ousting Assad
The West rejected Russia's offer more than three years ago, in which the Syrian president Bashar Assad would have to step down, says President Martti Ahtisaari for the Guardian.
According to the Ahtisaari plan proposed by Russia's UN envoy, in which Assad would take some time now for power with elegance.
The West does not have the proposal, because they believed Assad to fall anyway in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council member countries in 2012.
According to Mr Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Tshurkin listed her three point plan: The opposition has not been disarmed, in a face-to-face discussion between the opposition and Assad held as soon as the link to the speech and Assad from power that is needed to take a moderate pace.
I know Tshurkin's.
We may not agree on every issue, but we will be able to talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said that Alas, Martti Ahtisaari, so I will explain what we need to do, sit back in an interview with the Guardian.
The diplomats did not comment
Ahtisaari says the interim determination Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin not confirmed the substance of the debate, but Ahtisaari says that there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on the allegations, but said that the Assad forces were already at that time made a series of massacres and the main opposition groups refused all agreements, in which he would have remained in power.
The British Foreign Office's Middle East department of the former leader Sir John Jenkins is hesitant about the Ahtisaari speeches, in his experience, because Russia was not ready at any time to discuss the fate of al Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point of the argument is that Tshurkin spoke about Moscow's mandate.
If he tells me Tshurkin's speeches, I replied that I would like to hear the same President Vladimir Putinilta so that I can take it seriously.
Jenkins's claims that he had suspected in that case, it would have been Putin's trick to keep some sort of power by Assad supporters.
The influx of refugees in our own U
Ahtisaari, during the negotiations, some 7,500 people had been killed in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people to flee their homes as a result of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no other option than to keep these gaps in care of people.
We are now paying the bill, which itself caused our, Ahtisaari says newspaper.
The Torne imposed by the organizing centre for asylum seekers
The government is likely Torne is set up by the organizing centre for asylum seekers in northern Finland.
The centre would be established in the city centre to the Tornion empty yhteislyseo's building.
The Ministry of the Interior is looking for a suitable place, in order to better control the flow of refugees to the Swedish border.
Helsinki messages reporting on Tuesday that the council had already decided to make the condition of the school building as a solution to the problem of Homeland Security.
Tornion city council deputy leader Sauli Hyöpp of Mr Vas." says that it is not true.
When the council as a whole was not meeting and part porukasta wanted a formal decision, we decided to call the council meeting next Monday to decide on the issue, he specified for STT-AFP.
Present at the debate was 36 councillors from 43.
Arrangements centre against 13 councillors.
On the basis that it would wait for the decision to be positive, a Hyöpp says.
The city under Mayor Timo Nousiaisen was received on Monday, contact and reacting quickly.
The Poles have to accommodate an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
Experts have been checking in, that it would be appropriate for such use.
The location is a few hundred metres from the border, so it would be, in a sense, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä hopes to mount an option from the labour market adjustments
Under Prime Minister Juha Sipilän here. Public holiday money was sought by half to only part of the government to lower the price of the work.
The government, he said, but a welcome option package, if social organizations manage a fit.
Sipilä told reporters in the Swedish Parliament that he has not been in contact with social organisations.
He did not know how seriously the organizations are looking for ways to offset this, the government announced the work-life tension adjustments.
If such an agreement is created, we certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
Couples, half of the money would be Sipilän feel, in a way, because it would affect nearly all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government's planned cuts in the Sunday supplements.
The social partners to agree among themselves on a holiday to a cut of the money, because it is enshrined in law rather than collective bargaining.
The government says work blackmail government's statement to Parliament on Wednesday next week.
Sipilän proposals that organisations should be aware of this before.
The final deadline is this not the case.
The legislative work will then start on the other side of the train is on the move and it is becoming more difficult.
Now is a great time.
After all, in such matters, going for long if the will is there, Sipilä phrases.

FedEx's profit two-fold, drops in fiscal year 2016 prospects
FedEx reported disappointing results in the last quarter, and supply giant cut the outcome for the year as a whole, ennustettaan, due to weakened demand for freight services and higher costs for services in the country.
The company also said that it plans to hire approximately 55 000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it is to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its stock fell about 2.5% of the inaugural auction for 45 minutes before the bell on Wednesday's opening.
FedEx Corporation says that it expects next May at the end of the fiscal year - 10,90 10,40 USD, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.8 4, said the survey by Fact Set.
Lower outlook came despite an average of 4.9% in November despite the price increases, which come into force on January 4 a day, and started the higher and additional charges for transporting heavy or large parcels of land.
The company said that it expected business profits growing in the past year because they have cut costs, turnover has increased and online shopping is on the rise.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "is performing strongly in light of weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in the production and global trade."
The salary of the plans for the holidays came the day after rival UPS reported that will employ about 90 to 95 000 extra workers, roughly the same amount as it paid out last year.

The US Federal Reserve policy makers sit around a huge mahogany table for two days this week in a long-awaited meeting to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank hard chromium-plating seinämaalaus hunters on two floors of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues will put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
Congress has fallen on the shoulders of the Central Bank of mixed responsibility: They must maximize employment and keep prices stable in the United States.
After the Great Depression, the leaders of the central bank are accepted, however, that there is also a third, an unwritten mandate: Economic stability.
This is the third requirement can be a decisive factor in the decision published on Thursday, which is so tight that it cannot even predict. The decision about whether the US economy is ready vieroi for record of the decapitation, which has kept short-term interest rates at near zero until the end of the year 2008.
Although the vast majority of the data shows the economy growing strongly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets can be done in advance of the Central Bank officials wary even away more, as far as the increased volatility. There were, how would, if federal transfunds benchmark rate increase by at least a quarter percentage point.
"understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important points that are being monitored," says Lindsey M. Pieg Saitama, business broker Stifel Nicolas & Co's chief economic expert.
"I do believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for the normalisation of interest rates, increased uncertainty in world markets is enough to expect a valid argument yet," he says.
There is no consensus on the decision of the European Central Bank, which is in itself a source of nervousness about the economy.
Bloomberg's, according to a recent survey, about half of the economy, experts predict that interest rates will rise during the week.
While the financial markets expect the central bank to delay the increase as an opportunity for growth, according to a key indicator is only around 30%.
This implies a fall in the stock market, if the central bank to raise the level, unless leaders then failed to soften the blow by promising that the next drawing will not happen in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose 22 8,89 points, or 1.4%, with a new chapter 16 9,85 59.
The recovery brought expectations that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lon Yaroslavsky, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group - the main economic expert.
"is surprising, if the central bank to raise interest rates right now," he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates," they must see hard guidelines in order to support the financial markets so that they do not have to panic."
Some experts argue that the heightened level to calm financial markets, because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago seemed so this month that the central bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter percentage point, taking the first small step towards the tightening of monetary conditions slow, which would verify the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has said in the spring and early summer, that he expects the level projected this year despite the fact that the Liberals are calling for further economic development in their complaints.
Although the new job creation slowed in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, which is the lowest figure for seven years and close to the level that the central bank will keep the limit of full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of economic stimulation.
Although inflation remains below the central bank's 2% annual target, according to the central bank's policymakers, the main reason the temporary impact of the oil price is significantly lower.
Economic "reveal too much about the interest rates and also needs them, given the tight situation on the labour market," says Ian Shepherd Abbey, Pantheon Macro economics - the company's main economic expert.
Financial markets around the world, however, were upset last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average index fell as much as 16 percent in May from the slow, when investors feared China's economy also slowing global growth.
The market this month have recovered somewhat, and the Dow index is now nearly 10 percent below a record high in May.
The Central Bank decision makers in the market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation, which tells because interest rates will rise.
"Without these developments in the financial markets and the media in recent weeks, the weakness of the Chinese economy, policymakers would tighten the standard at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oli er, qualified Zim's Center for Real Estate's special investigator and a former central bank official.
He now predicts that the decision makers are waiting for at least a month to get a better idea of the effects.
"the potential impact on the economy of the United States are still very unclear, and do not have much information at their disposal, what will be the consequences of the events in China," Oli, says.
The international economic prosperity is not the key concerns of the Central Bank, so in theory it should not influence the decision-making process.
In practice, the Federal Reserve Board, however, has become the world's monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
In 2013, the then chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, suggesting that the central bank can "bridge" to increase the amount of money that caused upheaval in the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined in one, central bank officials are expected not only for the next development elsewhere, but also to consult the experts and other central banks in order to get a better idea of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science," says Zachary Kara Bell, asset management company not vest prompted Inc's head of global strategy.
The federal reserve bank in Virginia in Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey the pointed out this month, that "in the past, the central bank has overreacted movements in financial markets, which have had to be separated from the basic elements of the economy."
The decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and the decisions taken in the 1998/99, a member of the committee, invoking the example of recent years.
The Asian financial crisis was caused by the fact that the central bank cut its benchmark 0.75 percentage point during the trilateral meeting," despite its limited, identifiable from the effects of the US economic growth," says.
Years later, the central bank lifted these cuts.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during a major crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. province, a former member of the Bank of England, the Bank of England interest rate setting committee.
The latest turmoil does not come anywhere near the level of its province says.
"Nobody wants a situation in which an increase in the interest rate fears that piqued by the market," Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute the province says.
Federal law, the central bank, the Federal Reserve Act must still include the requirement for two forms, not to mention the financial stability. As long as this is the case, I do not believe that they should anticipate it.

University of Arizona's College of Medicine - Phoenix Blackstone says that although the study does not seem to be any survival or surgery after five years, there are the results of the study from Sweden, where the cuts led to longer life painav more people.
Swedish study found that slimming operation käynei by obese have had a 29% lower chance of dying during the period of 15 years, when they compared the group, which had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not seem to be any improvement to the survival of the surgery patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging, however, for people with a BMI under 35, and who are interested in a cut.

Why are witnessing the execution in Oklahoma
If any legal intervention does not happen, I believe, later in the day, when a man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I sit in the spectators gallery watching Oklahoma State Penitent Harding prison, when Richard Gloss ip executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses of his death.
Receiver request through his best friend in January, and although I was shocked, conceded.
I am a terrible start in the run-up to this day.
So why go on?
I agreed, because I thought that it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Journalists, of course, is the opportunity to watch the executions in America, and because the applications is often more than the available seats, the participants will be selected through the lottery of the horror.
Oklahoma has reduced from 12 to five seats reserved for the media.
Whoever is elected, though, believes the event cold.
I can do that.
I will sit next to Richard Gloss ip's closest friends, including my own, and I created him via telephone calls made in recent months, as well as one of the two and a half hour visit.
For me, man.
We often laugh at our jutellessa.
Prison authorities say that I cannot be both witnesses and a journalist, so I cannot be your agenda and a pen with me to record the sight of me.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One of the oklahoma journalist accused Twitter now that I am back to my parties.
This is the lesson.
The prisoner told his story as he sees fit, so pääset participate.
Complained to the reporter.
Hään admitted that "could have been the better word," but is still believe that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Gloss ip has disagreed with some of my messages, and I have written.
He did not tell me what I should write, and I would do so even if he would say.
I said to him that he may at any time remove me witness listaltaan.
But he insists that there is an international journalist, who writes on the subject.
If Gloss ip dies, he believes that the publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bell manpower is by my side.
If you want to know more, the affair, was able to listen to my podcast by a series of broadcasts.
I go through all the details again here.
I can say with certainty that Richard Gloss ip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Tree would make him an accessory to blame in any case.
But I think that is a very strong possibility that he is not guilty of murder.
I am sure that the evidence was sufficient to justify the death penalty.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And so, this is the aspect of it, which I think he will die.
I can say I am completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who care.
I have described what appears to be safe, when the man I love die unnecessarily.

Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria conference technicians tested by a cell spying share his talleihin last year, and threatens to stop competing with immediate effect.
He accuses toimitsijoita and Racing Victoria integrity chamber, claiming that they have a personal campaign under way against him. Wednesday Lady Tata's belated rejection of the treatment on the day of these Games as a result of the measure was the last neuronitis.
Moody told Fairfax media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the race, and that he has been in a difficult situation lidar's inexplicable positive cobalt after a sample.
He has held their tongues to spy on the doctoral student for a year and a half, and did, that "it would take cover."

They knew that the situation continued.
Sometimes just have to react and live with the sanctions, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and I sleep well.
I walk with my head held high, and I want the owners to think that I will do my best for them.
When they start to think differently, then I should not continue coach.
Then I would have to consider what I am doing for my license.
In the past, Moody tipaut racing.com - the site of the bomb in an interview in which he said that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall.
"one and a half years ago, Terry Bailey, Day le Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man by the name he asked my talleilla - and offered him a job, if he cares about what I am doing there.
They clearly see me as a charlatan.
If that is so, it is true, of course, they would be separated from her lawyer, because they have failed, I stole my role.
Robert Rou, Texas, the former chairman of Racing Victoria, David mode, the current chairman of Racing Victoria, as well as Bernard Saund Harding, the current chief executive of Racing Victoria, were all aware of the issue at the time, and are aware of today.
Should I start to think that this is becoming personal?
Whether Victoria Racing finally decided the 'masculinisation' a stand and perhaps shift the responsibility for any other than valmentajille about what is happening in the industry?
Am I a harmful industry?
Am I so detrimental to the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take away my license and pushed me aside, and I have no doubt that it is now saying those things might get them to think about it.
But I have now reached the point that I do not care anymore, and it makes me weep.
It really saddens me.
To put pressure on them to make a decision, which is their responsibility.
I have to support my family, and I can turn my back for that.
The frustration of the coach has grown long-held lidar's cobalt as a result of the study, and the late rejection led him to conclude that it could "throw their licence over the table."
Moody, who is best known can patch champion Black Caviar's valmentamisesta, has invited the rule on day care measures as 'ridiculous', after the mud or clay haude has been crushed by a horse, which is against the rules.
"it is against the rules of the competition.
I must take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly placed in the mud.
It could have been haude last night.
It might have been yesterday as it was.
It was one race day.
Moody can play a three months ahead of the Games Day haude for treatment, which conference technicians began an investigation.
It is a joke.
The people who create these rules do not know anything about hevosesta.
"Everything we understand the need for rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.

Melbourne Storm team coach Craig Bellamy attacking rivals wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised two of the NRL rugby league champion suosikin taklaukset allegations that his team would be part of a 'line'.
Sydney Roosters coach River Trent Robinson said erotuomareiden allowed the Storm "wrangling" on their side, when it unexpectedly won the Final karsinnan in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett, barely concealing his reference to the Storm, after it was won by North Queensland Cowboys Christian on Saturday evening Final karsinnassa. Bennett called the game of rugby league as a "shop window" and said that the two Queensland teams were "very enthusiastic" about the wrestling.
Bellamy taklauksia defended his team and said that they only focus on the "contact" takla expand.
Bellamy added that his confidence added two leading trainer towards storm of criticism, because it means that they are afraid of losing their team.
"This will always talk - I heard River Trent Robinson to speak of wrestling at the time, when we lost to them 24 - 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I cannot guarantee that we will not have any defence systems or our techniques throughout the year. During the last six weeks, we only have contact takla wedged, and it has led us to thrive.
River Trent has been to prepare the team for three years, and he is obviously a great team, so he is probably not accustomed to disappear, and this was a shock to him.
Funny how that always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby by recalling his mentor that Bennett's opening illative Field to St George Dragons won winning in 2010 gambling with 'dull'.
Wayne talks about the exciting rugby.
He was keen to compare our Saturday-night game Friday night in our game and tell us how exciting their games," Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St George team often criticised the fact that it is boring, and Wayne said, could not care less.
But now he is capable of playing a rugby team, which we see as an exciting, especially as he is quick to the young guys.
A game you play when you have the type of players.
He brought up the half of 2010, and now he wants all his tyylistään playing rugby - not every team has guys like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so to be able to play.
I think it will be more confident when they say such things, because they are a little bit concerned with playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably never thought of us contend the important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between the Storm and Roosters was richer than a game between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I have not looked at it yet, but how it ended? 16 - 12?
Our game was between 20 and 18, so we had to score two more, but is it an exciting rugby?
Or does it exciting the inaction of the Ministry of Defence and paint?
For me, this is about the lines.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
The Storm is off this weekend, as they have already won the right kotipeli either North Queensland Cowboys, or against the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night featuring finaaliin AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.
