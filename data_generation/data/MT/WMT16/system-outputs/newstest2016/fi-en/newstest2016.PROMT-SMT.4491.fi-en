The teacher admits shooting his girlfriend during an emergency call
It just a little bit of colors university teacher Shannon Lamb says during an emergency call the police that he shot his girlfriend and that police need to get their house.
Mr Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably upset, and said that a dead woman's next of kin details can be found on this phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss's body and the notebook page of the handwritten message: "I'm so so sorry I wish I could turn this I loved Amy and he is the only woman who has ever loved me," said in a letter, which according to experts, is signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that the Lamb, who taught two doing an online course Cleveland to Minnesota Delta State University, had already travelled almost 500 kilometres to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed at the history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, the office door.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford told university officials have heard about the shooting at 10.18.
He said Lamb called a dramatic 911 call for some time after that.
By the end of the day the death toll rose to one: Lamb committed suicide, police besieging sound.
Still, authorities tried to find out lamb motive of the day after pupils and staff had been due to the school shooting hide behind locked doors.
The researchers state on both sides have announced the information that the students and staff have been described by the gifted lamb as a teacher, which, however, may have had problems.
Students told me to have been waiting for her to their classes.

Schmidt himself was included in Lamb wrote a book which he thanked the "wonderful people," with which he distributed academic life.
Both taught political science and in the history department, which has a total of 17 members of staff, and many of the students took part in both a man courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of trouble.
A student named Brandon Beavers said lamb, but said that he was also nervous and anxious, "as if something was wrong."
Another student Mikel Sykes said Lamb, recounting that he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked for a sick leave Delta State University, saying that he had something of a health problem.
This year, he taught, only two doing an online course.
The recent changes at the university's pay principle meant that even though Lamb had worked hard in front of the Doctor value, it is not guaranteed at all to him as a career and automatic posts.
University principal William LaForge said that lamb and Schmidt in between his knowledge, there was no conflict, but that "clearly Lamb had in mind something."
These questions Lamb is no longer be able to respond.

Lamb was carried out by doctoral Educational Sciences in the spring.
One of the lamb from the old friends described him intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla hair ton said he was a 15-year-old and Lamb 20 years old when they met through friends in common.
Hair ton and his friends was in high school, and Lamb was nice, an older guy who tried to many years to teach hair Crete to play the guitar.
He was a charmer at the time.
All the girls were melting wax, when he was there, said 40 now hair ton, who lives in Jackson's Uptown Brandon in.
Lamb and Prentiss were apparently dating for some time.
For emergency call Lamb said he killed his wife, but their marriage is not a shred of evidence.
They had lightning called dog, who lived with them the river Gautier brick house.
Police said the dog to be in good shape.
Prentiss, a former husband Shawn O'Steen said they broke up 15 years ago, but had remained friends. They now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's very upset," O'Steen described her daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen said that there have been met with lamb, but had heard of the daughter of Abigail that lamb was interested in music and called the Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss, when the Lamb and Abigail were both performing summer market three years ago.
Later they called together someone even gigs.

Nothing seemed to be something wrong.
"Just happy the couple," he said.
We're just playing and we threw that sayings to each other.
So they were both quite clever.
The dead teacher Schmidt led to the first year student seminar program and was in with the Indians and colonial history, said the school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and he had three small children.
He studied at the Kansas Emporia State University and was order and the student government chairpersons.

UN leader says that the situation in Syria to be solved militarily
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the answer to the fact that Russia more military aid to Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "will not be solved militarily," and additional weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
UN leader once again called on all sides, including the divided the UN Security Council, to unite and to support the non-discriminatory political negotiations to find a solution.
Mr Ban said on Wednesday at a press conference that he intends to meet the five permanent member state - the United States, Russia, China, the British and French foreign ministers in the context of ministerial week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.

8 support the survey results which show that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to brand him pinwheels.
Some see him only as a joke.
Part of the wait for the crash.
Even though some Republicans have tried to heave Donald Trump the top spot in the away support queries, it's not ( yet) managed.
The last 11 national inquiry in 10 of Donald Trump has been at the helm that double digit in the 21st century, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means the real estate king the appointment as far as possible point of view.
The legislature, of course, have only just beginning.
These results are not yet mean that is likely to trump of the Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing its lead rising Herman Cain, neither of which has been backed by any state appointment procedure.
It is also the number of reasons why he would have a problem in general elections.
Outside groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative economic organization, the Club for Growth, however, have taken note of Trump resilience and started to use the money into his down a decision this.
The following recent the results support the inquiry suggest that the real estate king not just a passing phase:
Trump the figures come a have done a U-turn.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in the middle of June, Monmouth University support queries showed that only two Republicans out of 10 welcomed the property on the King.
By the middle of July, the figure was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 percent.
Currently, six out of 10 Republican is Donald Trump welcome.
About three out of ten, says that they are negative.
These figures are correct in the first the primary election in Queensland.
Making support for the survey by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week to 60 percent of Republicans said that they welcome Trump.
Two thirds of Republican voters would be happy if should trump of candidate.
CNN/ORC survey last week to 67 percent of Republicans said that they would be either "enthusiastic" or "happy," If Trump would be a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "shocked" if he should be a candidate.
Only Ben Carson will reach roughly the same level of enthusiasm than Trump (43 percent "enthusiastic" vs. Trump 40 percent).
Next, the most enthusiasm that causes?
Marco Rubio, only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent Republican voters would be "dissatisfied" or "shocked" if the favourite Jeb Bush should be a candidate.
Trump fiery nature is not a problem for the vast majority of Republicans.
Even if Donald Trump has been criticised for much of his speeches and pretentiously insults, on Monday, ABC News / Washington Post poll, according to a 52 percent of the Republican side trippers voters at national level, thinks that the property with the King is the President the right character.
Quinnipiac in recent weeks, according to a survey of the first Congress of organizing the Iowa State, the figure is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think that is the director of the Trump in the right character.
ABC / Post poll, 44 percent, however, thinks that his character as president, suited by the board, and almost six in ten is the view that his character belong to the White House.
Republican voters totuttelevat idea.
When Republican voters think such as the commentators, they have argued that Trump is a real option.
CNN/ORC, according to a survey of four in 10 people had to trump most likely option on the question of who most likely to be appointed to the Republican nomination.
Yet at the end of July, four in ten were in favour of Jeb Bush.
The data release: Republican voters do not always been in possession of the brightest possible crystal ball.
Last term, this time, four out of 10 Republican had thought that Rick Perry is appointed as a candidate, and only 28 percent in favour of the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters to trump the campaign as a credible.
Although Republicans will settle to support other candidates, Trump would win yet almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that fragmented field is likely to have contributed to trump leadership, as Trump support against is divided in a large number of other candidates in the middle.
Monmouth University survey, carried out at the beginning of September, however, showed that the hypothetical bilateral competition Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, between Trump gets majority support in almost all cases.
He will lead to Carly Fiore 13 points, Marco Rubio of 14 points, 15 points for Walker, 19 points for Jeb Bush and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie every 33 points.
He is equal number of points with Ted Cruz.
The only trump a winning candidate?
If they set off against each other, Ben Carson would win businessman Trump with 18 points of difference.
With just a majority of supporters of Donald Trump has said that they had made the decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the Trump in favour of the electorate has decided to their vote goes.
The situation, of course, can change, and no one can completely secure to say that never would change his mind.
46 percent said that they can possibly change candidates.
In any case, Trump, the biggest competitor at the moment, is another unlikely winner, a neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said that they had made the decision, are two times more likely to trump side.
Six out of 10 Republican says, that are with Trump agree on immigration.
Since then, when Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants to "rapist" I can start a campaign speech, immigration has been at the heart of the debate in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump bombast drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and harm retabled brands businesses.
Published on Monday, a new ABC / Post the poll, according to a six in ten Republican says he is with Trump agree on immigration.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is the Donald Trump.
The frustration of the government has risen reached a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their position outside of politics.
Six out of 10 Republican said on Monday, ABC / Post the inquiry, that they prefer politics than a third person, who has the government of experience.
They are angry at the federal government.
Two weeks ago, the Des Moines Register / as Iowa, the survey showed that three quarters of the Iowa Republican is frustrated by the Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent of the "really angry."
Jeremy Corbyn debut at Prime Minister's Questions
The first occurrence of Corbyn during question time has been eagerly awaited since his election
A new leader, Jeremy Labour, the Labour Party Corby faces David Cameron for the first time the prime minister's question time.
Corby will rise to ask for the first six question after a little at noon, and likely to be, and the media that Labour MPs are watching closely to his performance.
Corby has called for this weekly of the show "less theatre and more facts."
He has also said that could leave some of the opportunities of the hands of his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test of leadership, Corbyn after he was appointed the shadow of the board of directors and he was talking about Trade Union Confederation's annual meeting on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour leader's decision to stand silent during the national anthem of Tuesday's memorial, which took place in the Battle of Britain - the 75th anniversary of the air war, has attracted criticism on Conservative MPs and appeared in several front-page news stories.
Corbyn decision be singing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn spokesman said he "respectfully or so quiet" and that he recognised "the Royal Air Force's bravery the air war in Britain."
Mr Corbyn shadow, Owen Smith, said the BBC Twon Newsnight in the programme, that he had urged the Labour leader to sing national anthem, despite the fact that he believes that the king room should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow minister has refused to being involved in the inner circle Corbyn struggles on the grounds of economic affairs, defence and foreign policy. Originally, less than one sixth of the house party supported her leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that policy differences on the party's role in the European Union as well as the government the grant roof are "accumulated" also within the Labour party after the appointment of Corbyn.
Corby said Trade Union Confederation meeting that the Labour Party to make a change, which would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Smith said that the party was "very clear" about it, that they only oppose the government plans to calculate the roof of the 26,000 pound £23 0000.
Corbynista will be fifth in the Labour leader, which David Cameron has faced over the past decade, when he has been the Conservative leader.
Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he is "joukkoistanut" ideas issues, the prime minister, and received more than 30,000 proposal.
London borough of Islington North - the MP Corby has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is the nature of arranging too against each other and that he intends to abstain from both clever despite the verbal altercations that taunting, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corby has said that shadow financial secretary Angela Eagle works in his place at the time, inquiries and, when Corby will not participate in - for example, when Mr Cameron is abroad.
Corby has also suggested that other members also could sometimes be given to speak, and he has said approached the president of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on this occasion.
When Cameron rose to head in 2005, he said that he wants to move away from the kind of political theatre, which often associated with the prime minister's question time, but he was later to admit failure.
Since then, when they started to televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important indicator of assessing the judgement, the leader of his control of the House of Commons, as well as his position on the other MPs, although critics have been criticised on Question Time, that they have become just a caricature, which requires far-reaching reforms.

Metcash to start a grassroots campaign against the ALD invasion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA about his business ALD attack in southern and western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend market share IGA traders Southern and Western Australia before ALD $700 million in the attack.
Aldi is preparing two distribution centres, as well as the first store opening early next year, Southern and Western Australia, which is coming up to 120 trade. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen its relations with local the food and build IGA brand mainstream and social media through marketing and events, such as Adelaide show - the exhibition, through.
IGA traders and recruiters have jumped in, and brands such as Duns borough 'people of the future of ice cream manufacturer Simmo's offer us a tasting of IgA in the shops, and shop owners are selling concessionary tickets to the Australian football matches loyal customers.
Metcashin is expected to reveal more details strategic defense of on 29 September, when this food, alcohol and general hardware wholesaler investors to hold an annual strategy for today.
The game is a lot, because of the Southern and Western Australia are a total of almost 30 percent metcashin IGA shops region, and in the profit margins are higher than metcashin eastern provincial IGA network.
The South and West Australian shopping visitors are well known to be parochial, and IGA dealers in a much bigger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: More than 30 percent in the south and 24 percent in the west of the east, compared with 14 percent.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi grab around 5 percent of these two food market in the state within 12 months on the opening of the first movement. The turnover will be all the players, but mainly independent distributors.
In this week in its report, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA retailers may lose each year to $360 million in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year, in the South, 25 and 30 in the west of the movement, which produces 600 and $500 million in turnovers in these areas.
The food and food sales and volumes loss Metcashin high fixed cost base can pay Metcashille around $13 million a victory for the loss of movement before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash to lose market share in the eastern states, mainly ALD and Cole it, although in a recent Roy Morgan survey found that IGA customers were all of the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that metcashin food and food sales will fall to 3.8 percent in 2016; 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, so that its market share will fall in 2015-14, from 10.3 percent in 2020.
Last week, a leading investment fund manager and Magellan Financial Group founder Hamish Douglass said on a business dinner in Melbourne, that the Metcash to "very possibly lose a decade."
Metcash has refused to respond to comments made by publicly Douglass.
However, is understood that Metcashin member of the government would have taken last week, contact Douglass.
IGA market share has fallen since 2010 from 18 to 14 percent, and yields metcashin food and food business, who cares about the products in approximately 1200 the retailer a IGA, have fallen 43 percent since 2012. This reflects the reduction in debt financing, while sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler to assert themselves, and has invested each year more than $150 million for the calculation of the weekly prices of hundreds of products the same level with Coles and Woolworths, in helping to renovate the IGA retailers shops, adding to the faster growing fresh food, as well as bringing to market a better range of products private labels.

The Australian Tennis Association president Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more credit than criticism for its behaviour
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been suffering to a third party to the recent storm, which has been raging for his friend Nick Kyrgioksen around. He deserves more credit than criticism of their own behavior, says Australian Tennis Association president Steve Healy.
"The special see" - known as "gifted the pair, the younger Mr Kokkinakis had unwittingly public ex-case, where Kyrgios was irritated by Stan Wawrinka the Montreal Masters in the competition.
Shortly after a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati the referee was forced twice to distinguish between Kokkinakis and his opponents Ryan Harrison of each other when Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should use that kid."
While Kokkinakis was last seen tearing up his stick after a cramp ruined his possible Richard Gasquet win in the U.S. Open, Healy has been a staunch defender Kokkinakis.
Right now the young man is competing in Glasgow, Sam Groth for second place with two games with Bernard Tomic Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I'm pretty strongly believe that Thanasi has just been dragged into the fray," Healy said.
He broke his stick when losing because of cramp in the U.S. in open, but he is not the first player who breaks his stick, frustrated and I know thanas well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But he's been extremely well, also a pretty provocative images situations, the U.S. Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves the plaudits.
He is a great team around him, he is a great family around them, and I think he has been treated a bit hard.
He is very mature age 19, he works hard, fine, according to the teams and so on, and he has never had problems with the other players. He is held in the locker room, he trains hard, is in good condition and is very calm and mature young man, and I think he should be to assess the merits.
Healy has also supported the decision to be the exception of Kyrgio starting on Friday, according to the important games, describing this "codecisions" all good for a solution, but still, the employee's Canberra kind a return to the team.
"We want the team to be totally focused on games and all polemics [ Kyrgios] around them," Healy said.
And Nick has risen very quickly, so as, for example, Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he's going to grow up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all their criticism. However, we are trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of their actions, and I think that's the best, as well as the team that to him if he spends some time away from the public eye, reflecting on these consequences.
The immigration crisis: Hungary to declare a state of emergency, closing the borders, to arrest immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed eu-serbia of southern limits waiting with bated breath to see those who tried to enter the country illegally. The aim is stemming the flow of migrants coming to the country.
At the border was followed by chaos, when hundreds of migrants gathered in neutral territory, and react to the dismay of the Serbian authorities.
People who fled to domestic violence, have now put up a tent and settled in for an indefinite period reached a stretch between the two countries.
Frustration, however, grew up.
The police fuelled by a helicopter above them migrants lived during "open the border!" and exclaimed violations of the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Serbian foreign minister, declared that it is "unacceptable" for migrants return rktl, when they arrive for the whole time more Macedonia and Greece.
" ( Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause harm to civilians.
Debate has to be in the coming days and other countries with Brussels, "Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Chaos in Hungary and Serbia on the border was born after the nationality of the 28 of the bloc was creating a common immigration policy, contentious meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed in the division of responsibilities 40 000 people in the case for applying for asylum, who now have captured the Italian and Greek. They talked about hopes of reaching a final agreement next month, or by the end of next year - about what the EU countries having 120 000 in addition to escape the law, including some of the rktl.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for Tuesday next week, the extra EU summit to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary is not, however, put hope the fact that its neighbors or Brussels would work in the near future.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two in the southern region gave authorities greater powers to act in crisis and made it possible that you can be shut down and place in the right stuff can be accelerated.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now, when a fence on the border with Serbia is ready, the country will also set up the number of Romanian barbed wire fence to stop picking against a flood of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D 'Agata reported that even prisoners were being sent to refine the barbed wire fence, according to Hungary and Serbia, respectively.
In recent months rktl has become the biggest bottleneck and points of entry to the European Union for refugees, many of whom are in a war on the run from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
The Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has argued that the majority of the incoming are economic refugees looking for a better life, and who are fleeing the war itself, which are entitled to protection - this view is strongly against the other EU countries, including Germany, with.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now a crime, will be determined by the company's cross or harm 4 metres (13 feet) the barbed wire fence, which the government has built a eu-serbia to south of the border, as well as for those convicted include longer prison sentences for traffickers.
"Mass migration caused by the situation, the Hungarian government to declare a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the Southern in the town of Szeged.
We are very clear: The illegal crossing the border is a crime.
Parliament must still formally adopted next week expected the captain of the positioning, but the Associated Press journalists at the border have seen for days heavily armed military personnel means of transport and their dogs.
Orban's domestic security advisor Gyorgy Bakondi said that authorities were taken to the 45 people in their attempt to cross the border, and 15 for further in the country had a chance.
They got more than damaging the fence, have now captured by the police, and they are accused of the new legislation defined offences.
Authorities quickly fix the fence.
The Hungarian officials closed Tuesday morning, the two of the seven of the Serbian border crossing point, after they were sent by barbed wire wagon train of to close one of these places.
The main border crossing close to the Hungarian roszkessa was chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in the metal container for processing and the crowds came to shove inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left outside.
A group of immigrants blocked main engines between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to food and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.

A quarter said their support for him with reservations, and 15 percent would support him just because he is the candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It's not too surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be keen on his to support.
Opinions are sense those who are currently in favour of Clinton - only a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of voters Democrats says that they would support Clinton, Republicans looking forward to the top man Donald Trump of the same says fewer Republican voters (35 percent).

The Democrat voters generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically agree.
When you look at all these issues, about a quarter of Democrat voters says that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Even if Hillary Clinton's personal email address and the use of the server, in his foreign minister, raises more questions, the majority of Democrat voters is happy with his explanations on the matter and says that it affected their the general opinion him.
It is different, though, when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with his explanations, and only about a third is welcome.
The people's opinions were divided in March, soon after, when it came to light.
The majority of Americans, says that the Postal Service polemic backpressure affected their all the women's views Clinton, while 36 percent say that their opinions he has deteriorated.
More than six out of 10 Republican says that their opinions Clinton has become worse.

Five members of the order is accused of the first year of the Baruch College Student's Death
Almost two years after the student died of the Brotherhood mobbing ere many elections Pennsylvania in the Pocono Mountains in the region, a murder charge has been brought against five people.
The New York City, a Baruch College, Cambridge University Pi Delta Psi - the Brotherhood members were cruelly Chun "Michael" Deng's attacked membership rite in September 2013, during and after his lagged hospital it, thus contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say that Deng's eyes and was tied to his back more than 13 a kilo were loaded into a backpack full of sand, after which he repeatedly tackled in the country, when he tried to walk through the icy fields towards goal.
In the end of the Deng complained that his head hurts, after which he lost consciousness.
The Brotherhood members are called the emergency number Deng's light-headedness, but according to the allegations against waited an hour before brought him to hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change the Deng's clothes, to find online information about his symptoms, and to make contact with the Brotherhood, national chairman, Andy Meng asking for advice, chief officer Chris Wagner told a press conference.
"This is where members began to hide the ritual their equipment and so, in practice, imposed the Brotherhood welfare ahead of Michael Deng's," chief Wagner said.

This is what happens when the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates
Raising interest rates will be, and the emerging market rates fall, bond yields are rising and the economy falls into recession.
We know this.
What we don't know, it is how long until everything is going or how long it lasts.
History does not give little help in terms of timing, what comes to the economy.
The arrival of the recession has taken the first after harvest sometimes just 11 months, sometimes, meanwhile, has gone as long as 86 months.
Aggression to the US central bank lifting interest rates has often been, if not always, the determining factor in how the economic and financial assets will react.
That's why the U.S. central bank officials are so energetically insisted that investors should not focus on it, because interest rates start to increase, but mainly the normalisation of the situation in time to go to the development.
The equation is indeed a number of variables.
Ultimately, however, market participants can see that see an increase of all the fuss has been inflated.
"The central bank's first global financial crisis post-nice increase will inevitably be interpreted in some circles" cheap money "end of an era," said Capital Economics Global Affairs the Alou expert on heads Julian Jessop of the message to customers.
Instead, we don't expect that the U.S. interest rate a gradual return to normal, albeit still low, level is a disruptive shock, which many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it would have consequences.
Below is an overview of how some parts of the economy will react on the basis of earlier development:
As the market has seen about the last months, interest rate increase waiting can make the situation unstable.
When the increase will be a fact, the impact is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that the capital of the proceeds from tend to stop 12 to 24 months for the first after an increase of, which in turn, possibly delay reflects the monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study about what happens after an increase in the central bank.
Specifically, about the last 35 years, the market are usually in a strong, about 14 percent on the rise as we approach the increase, 250 days after the situation is relatively flat ( the average rise of 2.6 percent), and normal mode is reached 500 days after an average return in six of the last cycle, 14.4 percent, is reported to Nuveen Asset Management - the firm, a leading the capital of a strategist Bob ble in a recent analysis, which was published in Barron 'e-journal.
Deutsche Bank, according to the impact on equities is usually clearer the increase cycle at a later stage, when revenues are starting to fall.
Regressions are part of the economy, but the rate of withdrawals often contribute to their income.
In the current situation in the central bank is facing some challenges, which has not previously have been, and that can boost the recession.
This is, in particular, gross domestic product, which will be the closest to the lowest of all time, its level before the central bank rate hike.
Deutsche Bank in 1950, according to the 118 after lifting the annual nominal GDP is only twice been less than 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 percent, few believe it will remain when the third quarter is at 1.5 percent, says Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Lifting interest rates so the fragile the economic architecture can be risky and raises the question of "is this time different," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants are prepared for the central bank's base throughout the year, and all are waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee, the committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Even though many strategists and economists believe that the committee may accept the increase in this meeting, futures trading expects only 25 percent more likely.
"Our research shows that since 1950, all the increase cycles have so far occurred in the growing leverage super cycle where GDP has surpassed the previous recession peak very quickly after the recovery has begun," the report says.
By contrast, now there has been exceptionally slow recovery from recession, which has been the worst observation period.
Currently, ykl in central bank is expected by far the longest in the last of the end of the recession: The record has been 35 months, and now there is already 74. a month.
A fixed rate has also been volatile market while waiting for a rate hike, and the model recalls a certain amount of capital, the findings.
The main difference between the central bank is moving the line, its effects are faster to balance the books than equities.
Income from bonds, the trend appears to have a rotation of the first increase in the immediate cycle performed in the case.
At the end of the increase cycle bonds yields will fall immediately, "Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab - strategists believe that lifting interest rates cause longer and on a shorter time income bonds, smoothen convergence in yield curve.
High yield bonds are often better in this situation, even though "we are still cautious in terms of the search for yield," said Schwab's fixed rate of return on investment analyst Kathy Jones in one of the analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the central bank line expectations.
"Dollar strength and inflation expectations of the bill, in addition, there are several signs that the market has adapted to tighter monetary policy outlook," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more even, credit spreads have grown and volatility has grown - all of these are characterised by the market when the central bank has tightened policy on.
Generally speaking, the companies whose business is centered largely to the United States, win, when interest rates are rising and local products will be more attractive.
Multinational companies, which is a lot of debt, are performing worse when the dollar's rise in their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will be more expensive than what they have the funding.
"History shows that" quality "shares generally are more productive, the first three months following an increase in interest rates," Goldman Sachs analysts said customers in its report.
Companies with strong turnover, surpassed a poor turnover companies in 1999, 2004 and 1994, after increases in an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility, the shares, performed better than low end companies. The former had an average of 4( percentage points) and the latter 3( percentage points).
The debt will be a big problem.
Those companies, which is a lot of variable rate debt, are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside the stock exchange speculation and consumers have the opportunity to benefit from the dollar value increases.
Savers can also make a profit as a result of higher profits, although experts have different views about how quickly influence seems to be.

The Conservative MP Damien Collins criticised the at the Voice, the BBC music competition, which was bought by a Dutch production company enthalpy media, according to estimates of 22 million pounds.

Time for many, then standing on the common sense.
Asked whether the strike, when already is doing badly.
Has even created resistance.
Online more than 50,000 people have already been to announce that going to be part of the protest, but goes to work.
The good old days the consensus at the time such would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet, where the protest, but openly scab s declaration would have been a small human political suicide.

The University of lappeenrannan hard on the cost cuts: The aim to 8.5 million in savings, staff will be reduced 130
The University of Technology lappeenrannan start savings in, with the aim is to get costs lopped a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings the university to start the entire staff of cutbacks, whose savings target each year is 6.5 million.
In practice it means the reduction of about 130 employees.
Other activities aims to save the addition of two million.
Employer-employee negotiations in the background is in the 2016 budget, which anticipates operating to be 8.5 million deficit.
There are also affected by the government's budget cuts.
This year the university is doing about 2.6 million the outcome of the deficit.
Costs will increase by next year for a little bit, but at the same time to get the funding will be reduced from the Ministry of 2 million and the rest of the funding of EUR 3.2 million.
The university has a total budget of around 85 million euros, so the savings target is ten percent of the entire budget.
The massive research and education cuts in corporate finance, as well as the cumulative effect of a reduction in university is a very important, says the president, Ms Paul, the Bulletin of the university.
Before the summer of the effects of cuts still had the, but now an additional reduction in funding is manifesting itself in the new perspective.
Negotiations with the shop stewards will be launched on Tuesday next week and they last imposed by the law, six weeks.
Yle: Luck of the bus wants the railways
The cheap bus company owner, a British Sir Brian Souter says YLE that the company will aim for the rail in Finland.
I am very keen to leave, according to the rail.
My company Stagecoach is one of Britain's biggest railway companies, Souter says.
Rail is scheduled to open up competition gradually.
The first is the turn of the capital city transport in 2017-2018.
Traffic is followed by the interurban.
Souter says has already been approached Department for Transport.
The Department of Transport will be held, according to the company welcomed the plans.
Other international companies interest in rail transport, has announced that at least Transdev ( a former energy market), which is as well as rail and bus service in the rest of Europe.
The U.S. central bank has to make decisions on rates
The rest of the world is to watch, when the U.S. central bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision for them to increase interest rates in order for the first time in nearly a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economist in the heat a little more than half of those who only last week, believed the central bank raising interest rates, now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates will be held in the current 0-0.25 percent level.
It is a historic event, because of it, when the central bank cut interest rates to zero, is seven years.
For the first time we are approaching the situation in which at the central bank is able to get out of the zero level and to begin the normalization of rates, "said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institue for International Economics - Economic Institute senior fellow.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought balance sheets of trillions of dollars and created a bit of inflation.
The central bank, however, cannot ignore the less rosy global prospects.
It has warned of the market to the fact that they must be prepared for the increase, but the signs indicate they also believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be released on Thursday at 8 p.m. ( CET).
Delta State University shooter left apology message
After shooting girlfriend Mississippi on Monday morning - before he shot his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note which said he was "sorry" the first murder, and hoped "that could take it back," authorities said on Tuesday.
Gautier of Mississippi, police said that Delta State University geography and social sciences teacher Lamb called 911 around 10 a.m.
On Monday and said that he has shot and killed someone.
Lamb said the defendant, that the police need to send officers to his home.
He said, "he killed his wife last night," and also mentioned that the House is "a sweet dog," which "does not bother anybody," but it is probably upset.
Police asked the caller's name, but he never told me.
Lamb did not give an explanation for the shooting.
When police got here, there was Amy Prentiss 41 years of age of 45 years of age the body, as well as written by lamb from a message which read: "I'm so sorry I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and he was the only person who has ever loved me. "
For writing a message to Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers Delta State, where he was killed by a history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before eventually killed himself late on Monday police besieging him.
University principal William LaForge said that lamb and Schmidt in between his knowledge, there was no conflict, but that "clearly Lamb had in mind something."
Authorities said on Tuesday that the published on Monday, despite allegations that Lamb would have thought to have been Prentiss in relation to the Schmidt, was "not at all the information or evidence" of any sort of "triangle drama."
Shawn O "Steen said that he had been married to Prentiss around seven years and described him" a good person. "
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O "Steen said that he and Prentis was a 19-year-old daughter, who is" upset ".
O "Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were" simply the best of friends. "
Lindsay Knowles, Prentiss worked from home by hand on the web. The Sun Herald, Knowles was Prentiss, a close friend.
Knowles said that Prentiss, which was a dog named Lightning, Lamb had been dating for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at some point Monday to tell them that, "he's not going to jail."
When police officers reached lamb Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Mr Lamb stopped his car to the side of the road, left it there and started running into the forest, where he shot himself.
Lamb has a doctorate in education and Delta State in the spring of 2015, says the university's website in the record.
The Stars, who lost their charm
The actor ( left), pictured with son Redmond ( right), the last few years have been tough.
In 2001, he suffered from leukaemia, and in 2009, her longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
There are rumours that he has also been a drug problem, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All this really takes its toll.
Manchester United, Luke Shaw is out for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw was in his right leg double fracture Manchester United loses the PSV Eindhoven to the Champions League game.
Although the defender was left in tears and is out at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw would not be able to play again this season.
Hector Moreno of the injury was caused by reckless tackle the 15th minute after a 20-year-old PSV Shaw was much more significant in the region.
He was treated nine minutes on the ground and he had to give oxygen to the hospital before removal.
Van Gaal said: "He's got double fracture wearing, and he is now in hospital."
He will be transferred to tomorrow or maybe a day after that, and then cut in Manchester.
This is terrible. The boy will be Manchester United at the age of 18, is suffering from difficulties and since then, is playing brilliantly, and now this happens.
When I was in the locker room, he had oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but double fracture will take at least a half years, and he is playing to the group stage.
I hope that he will be able to play this season.
Moreno was lucky, when he was or the red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli has punished Mexican players.
Van Gaal suggested that an Italian official was wrong.
You can judge the situation, when I say that it became the penalty and a red card.
It was a really bad two leg of the tackle.
Shaw tweeted the following: "Thank you for all the messages, words cannot express how disappointed I am, my recovery is starting now, I come back stronger."
On this subject: Manchester United is suffering from Luke Shaw and loses PSV ex-case
British the defender is a further incentive to recovery next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "It's a really bad injury."
If a player is forced out of this because of injury, are all very sad.
Our players is not intended never to hurt opponents.
Moreno, a broken leg when he played the Mexican team van Gaal against Holland in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno will take this hard, because it is not intended to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is a really bad, it's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn't see in that situation.
The only thing that this was the ball, who was going a different direction, so it looked like he [ Moreno] would be unaffected by it, but I have seen Luke's tackling.
Moreno said for SBS6: "I know what it feels like, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel terrible for this reason, I'm so sorry. "

Of course, David Cameron knows the Lorax this better?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves something of the paper, it does not take long before it learns almost on the outside.
If you're not only is David Cameron.
When the holiday childcare, providing the service asked the Prime Minister his favourite a children's book, he chose the Dr Seuss's The The Lorax - the book, published in 1971, environmental story.
The choice was a difficult time, Mr Cameron writes the company's super camps's website published a message and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book for my children, because it always seems to be found the image or a message that we have not previously seen. "
All this is true, but the next paragraph, where Cameron presumably describes the book a coherent whole, it is a summary of the film version of 2012, where a relatively short on which they are written the original had been added to the new characters and the details.
"Within the walls in the tarvillen town where all of nature's lost and even the air is a commodity, ted-son hopes of winning the dreams of a girl's heart side by Audrey's desire to see the tree," and described the text says love story, which in 1991, died of Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, not written.
If this is not yet enough suspicious, Cameron, the text sounds in some places, as it would have been taken to the Internet Movie Database website of are the Lorax film plot summary, which starts with: "Within the walls in the Tarvillen town where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, ted-son hopes of winning the dreams of Audrey girl the heart of the side."
Given that Cameron has publicly active older, it seems unlikely that he would be so unacquainted with the book to drink. In a young, an anonymous boy hears how local natural has destroyed the greedy, trees for hacking and tarviksia weaving the Once-ler, regardless of the name of the story of issuing a brief, moustachioed The Lorax thing, "which speaks on behalf of the trees."
Such a relatively invisible public relations task has probably been outsourced assistant who does not appear to have ever read a book 20 times in a row for the child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman, said that the text is likely to become Cameron's constituency office.
Super camps confirmed that the text was Cameron's staff, but has not commented on it because of the moment any more.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being set aside the England team, but it was still a hard place
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see, what kind of Team England has opted for the tour, I don't think at the previous 3-0 series loss is likely to recur.
I would not rule profits ruled out.
Alastair Cook's side can be less experienced than three years ago, the team, but it is involved in the good the spiral batsmen and team philosophy is strong: They do not have the scars of 2012, only youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali develop flutterball and Adil Rashid's the striker option, although it is unknown at this level.
On this subject: Adam Lyth fell to the English cricket, he will be replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth, the team is understandably difficult to analyse me because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers challenging circumstances, and a simple but the sad truth is that the cricketer is criticised their on the basis of its performance.
The choice of Joe Root, for example, there was no uncertainty before release, because, as I've said before, the players are the best choice rightholder.
About 100 points higher, and Lythin season the team would have been able to continue, but he was in charge of their own destiny.
Hopefully, if he gets more home runs, one of the Yorkshire the opportunity comes to the front.
The England head coach Trevor Bayliss has praised Lythin attitude even when he was not performed quite as well as we should have, and it surprises me. Lyth is above all, a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the batsman will mark the filing.
Lyth was elected to seven times the national team, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was nine.
Only the Compton got the chance to play, both at home and in.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first to the Caribbean when Lyth was on top form, but it missed the opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales will be included, and it is a batsman that I appreciate.
There is a cricketer it something that we in Yorkshire we saw in the early hours of this season, when he made 236 points against US Trent Bridge on the ground.
He will have to make at least the same opportunity than others before him, but this of course, depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea has shuttled Moeenista shot in the opening Cook's side, when on the ground would be an extra pitcher but can be kept four quick, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why the batsman could hit there, and this left-handed has already shown that he was a bit of a cricketer.
Moeen is not necessarily done the job the county municipality Worcestershire, but he is giving them a three and there is little difference.
An old team mate Justin Langer played the first 38 games in the first gate of fell before being moved to the opening in 2001.
He made as soon as three hundred points and recalled the past.
Zafar Ansari will see backup pitcher, and, what little I've been in contact with him, he seems very impressive young man.
People can watch his unvarnished statistics - to slam average of 31, with the ball 35 - and think that it is a gamble, but there's not too much feeders and the voters chose the young.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
A team of outside England, appears to be a few tough addition to the side of the coach.
Striker Sri Lankans Mahela Jayawardene consultant appointment of the games may prove to be brainwave.
He is one of the game of the nicest guys, and brings a huge amount of experience, because it's done it all in all situations, and all sorts of attacks.
Paul Collingwood will, according to the white ball games, and brings with it, and that a whiff of the relentless energy.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, then it was playing or coaching, and he's the same sense than to be exploited Mahe Lalla.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can boost the team, although their message would be the same as before.
Collyn teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, the rest day-long, The Root was given a break against Australia, and I do not have any problem with this.
Though not all are agreed, trainers and chose don't make the schedule.
And we must remember that, just as the players, their job depends on results.
Such decisions are never done lightly.
A British departure from the EU ( Brexit) will support will be able to take victory, if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron half-woolen retabled negotiation strategies in order to keep Britain in Europe are becoming increasingly larger problems, although would not take into account even our most heartfelt Jeremy "is it Yes or No?" Corbyn selection Labour leadership of the Trade Union Confederation, or get upset for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also has its own Corby and Nigel Mr Farage.
European a diplomat friend explained recently that because the EU is so deep in a variety of crises, all of whom are not their fault, some member states are tired of the British self-centered agenda, which is full of friction, causing the concessions and disrupting amendments that these countries are the most part, want.
The annual meeting in Brighton trade union confederation decided that it did not want them, if they undermine the social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George the serving of selfie.
The Prime Minister and Finance Minister arrive late or summits in foreign capitals, there will be bilateral meetings, take a picture of himself famous local memorial in front of the local of the eye to do either with or without him, and then come home, saying that will win support for the reforms.
It's all about me.
A European friend, who wants to outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says - to suggest that certain capitals lyhytnäköisimmät ministers and officials are now at a point, that they don't care then we'll go.
The German cautious and restrained chancellor Angela Merkel's ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave their action before it goes by the same way as it was too long stayed Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
The French Francois Holland about in front of a re-election or the replacement in 2017.
He is the strength of the fugitive.
Poland may soon be the nationalist right-wing government, Spain leftist.
It is difficult to see these countries self-sacrifice on behalf of selfie Brit road when their energy would be better to direct it, that Scotland will leave the United Kingdom - they don't want that either similar own a separatist tendencies as a result.
So, my friend to make some such ministers may even planned consciously useless notation in the style of the Scottish National Party of Great Britain 2017 during the referendum campaign to accelerate Brexit process.
"Re-negotiations was setup" and "the renegotiation there was no difference to the United Kingdom."
Europeans have had personal experiences of how greedy Fleet Street related either by the press can be and how eu-skeptical press the mighty have what they were not Tony Benn, inspired by the 1975 referendum at a time when that started in 1973 received confirmation of our membership, the ratio 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest the euro opportunistic, who made a name for himself, writing "The EU's direct bananas" when he was as a correspondent in Brussels in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband was perhaps a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They belonged to a diverse range of taxes away from other strangers, phones hacking foreigners, and the people, whose office is nominally noneuropean and who own the bulk of the big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought of them just as well, but realized that if you're in a cage with the gorilla lustful, bananas have to be abandoned because of the decoys, if they don't want to be that the gorilla lunch menu and later still, at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was blairilaisempi than Blair, in what will be Cameron to renegotiate the trick resistance. Bair, in fact, the EU had agreed to the principle behind the rejected constitution, which the French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, thus giving the Blair a way out of the situation.
The press did not give him that either never forgive.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who patted me kindly in the back of the Westminster Parliament House on Monday ( I told him that he no longer have time to waste me), appears to be at risk to play again, Neil Kinnock's 1980s Murdoch boycotted strategy, which was a mistake and then that now.
Even though it may take time, however, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not me, but there is no doubt that Andrew to Marr, whose the BBC the couch Corby went on Sunday.
Corbyn official status in Europe is, to put it politely, evolving.
He says, that would want us to remain a newly renovated in the EU.
Well, the majority of people, the UK Independence Party UKIP war paint enthusiasm, as well as conservative Wilder outside the nationalists can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn fan" Benn said so, as well as on the radio that on TV this week, when his internal the Boy Scouts would have liked to admit that Corbyn choice to appoint rugged John McDonnell shadow minister of finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the Seventies, when his dad stretched on TV, trying to be disloyal Labour government colleagues points without, however, that would go so far, that would lose the government of place.
Hilary to pinch it were more attractive.
But in the fight on behalf of that to stay involved "in a situation where any" - Benn utterance - was not what McDonnell said, and all indications are that what Corby told the stretcher and elected representatives in a private meeting on Monday night.
Any sort of thing is it non-hierarchical, emotional and personal picture that Corby wants to convey ( remember that he even touched me), communications discipline is important, 24-hour TV era, and in particular at the forefront of social media, which is at a breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, is only fair to give Cameron to get free of charge to Europe by allowing her to keep Labour support in the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins at least thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn the initial beating on EU membership ( and therefore in line with their Benn intellectual fully regulated, its economy and the anti-capitalist with its past) is no longer just abstruse that thought that the left debate on the small differences in which narcissism is a central dogma doctrinal bickering in.
What will be his duality Nato's relationship with ( Tom Watson is convinced siitäm that Corby campaigned for collecting), the foreign country Diplo countries of the road just have to try to explain the superiors.
Why the Paris or Berlin would spend political capital ( they, too, is sceptical voters) to make concessions to Britain, when it can be completely pointless?
The United States has been somewhat disappointed with the British military's poor performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even to cut the cost of the Conservative government in power, as I was reminded on Monday, British Influence Security Forum starting up the forum for security cooperation.
Experts are critical of the Public Health England electronic cigarette assessment
The researchers have said that state funded the agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than traditional, was born in 12 of the meeting, which some had links with the tobacco industry.
The British Medical working for the Journal ( BMJ) write experts shared the Lancet criticizing Public Health England ( PHE) used by the evidence in its report, electric tobacco.
PHE published this "milestone" - its report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive a review of the evidence."
Several scientists, however, have questioned the sustainability of the data and pointed to some experts and links between the tobacco industry.
Medical the magazine The Lancet, published last month, the editorial, which was attacked PHE the main conclusion of "exceptionally brittle base" against.
The other two BMJ wrote researchers have considered whether the allegations "built on the rock or on sand."
The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the European School of Public Health Professor Martin McKee, as well as the University of Liverpool clinical epidemiology professor Simon Cape well says: "Public health the guiding principle is that practices need to set up a proof of the required effectiveness."
They say that the public expect that PHE premiss "the current best estimates that e-cigarettes are around 95 percent less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on evidence and a detailed assessment of modelling.
In fact, it will be one of 12 of the meeting, which was developed in many of the Criterion decision analysis model ( MCDA) synthesize their opinions disadvantages associated with different products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting intensified research.
McKee and Cape well say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company nominal the euro for Swiss Health, which is reported to have been previously managing director of the funding your Bris Tish American Tobacco company for independent research.
He also supported the bat the people's health authority sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people announced that it has received funding from the manufacturer of electric, but it is not funding, which he is reported to have been earlier in the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
Members of the panel selection criteria is not being reported, but the panel includes several widely-spread electric supporters, some of which also show that it had received funding from the field of study.
Others, there were no widely-spread their expert in tobacco control.
PHE also attended the meeting director of tobacco.
The research group "suggestive admits," that there is a gap "undoubted evidence on harm in the majority of the products and the vast majority of the criteria," McKee and Cape well write.
None of these connections or restrictions, however, is not to mention the PHE report.
McKee and Cape well PHE claims say about that, "so far, there is no evidence that electronic cigarette is route to incineration kids or non-smokers" to be premature.
The Department of Health and Welfare, PHE director Professor Kevin Fenton says that the BMJ allegations have been answered in the past.
He says: "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Half of their lives her dependency smokers will die.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks are caused by a relatively small, but we must continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE is a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence seems to be and what it does not appear to be, especially when compared to the relative dangers of tobacco is so much public but doubtful.
Nearly 80,000 people each year die from smoking related disease and smoking costs NHS each year to 2 billion pounds.
The current evidence explaining - in other words, even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their drawbacks are only a fraction of the traditional tobacco harm - our national responsibility.
The BBC should give up on EastEnders, says former Channel 4 - leader
The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, sending, and that commercial competitors "would give anything" for hits like this, for example, Albert Square - on the street, taking place at saga.
Johnson said that fees should only be used to make the programmes that other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticised the BBC that it put on a public service of the programmes that are likely to have lower the public, difficult delivery time competitors against the most viewed programmes and to those channels, like BBC4.
After BBC director-general Tony Hall said the company's willingness to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he was Channel 4 at the time in six years to develop a relationship with the BBC, in vain.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC to produce and distribute programs, which would be clearly Matt subsidised by their own competitors," Johnson said the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its research into the future of the BBC.
If the license fee is considered to be caught - and I'm not sure that it would be for this station or in the long term, a good idea - it should at least limit the scope of its production to programmes that others do not do and that.
The at The Voice will be sent to the scheduling of the most important, because its future is to collect as much support as possible.
The idea that no one else would the programme, is a joke, it's ridiculous, it is clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why regressive tax should be to fund programs that could be used to finance the without state aid.
The Voice is one of those and EastEnders, the second, admittedly, within the house have been taken.
Frankly, other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand how it is about public service broadcast.
I don't think it would undermine the BBC at all. "
Channel 4 2004-2010 led to serial entrepreneur, Johnson said that the BBC is guilty of hunting, the number of viewers "people working there objectives, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
The BBC he comments on the most popular series are reminiscent of the former Sky's leader Tony Ballin comments. He spent in 2003 in Edinburgh MacTaggart lecture to propose that the BBC would sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC a smaller audience public service programs "go on BBC4, which often cannot be measured the amount of viewers, but the BBC to fill in a way of their responsibilities and can then £4 billion in defence of the licence fee revenue hypocritical to say that 'of course, we are doing all these unknown programmes that no one will look at". "
They are putting them in the place of dispatch, which no one will ever see them.
Royalties on on the committee, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find the report system there, who will be the highest value for money.
Of course you all think, we all think that £150 a year will be a lot of value for money, but I don't know if that's true for those people for whom £150 is a lot of money, because they do not use the BBC that much.
The former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elst, who also testified on Tuesday, the committee, said that the BBC should be to revise its Reith early to do "to inform, educate and entertain."
He said that only a small part of the BBC production is classified as today, he also said the figures to be 1% TV production and 0.1 percent on the radio - and that it should take inspiration from the Australian and Canadian yleisradio and change to be done to "inform, educate and entertain."
What will be partnership issues, Elst said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he said, are shown on television, only some fishes, and form an alliance with commercial companies so that all of these should be made available online.
"The voice of the genetics" allows the management of the sound waves
Video shows how the nematode change direction as soon as voice impulse hits them.
The researchers have increased the worms, which is genetically edited the nervous systems, so that they can be controlled ääniaaltopurkauksilla.
Tiny nematode change tack immediately after the hits voice impulse, which is too high human ears to hear.
On top of the impulses are genetically edited by connecting the motor neurons, which is ultrasonic waves react membrane channels.
On this subject: The researchers read and write the brain active new light
The researchers said that the worms, a new show, the designated äänigenetiikaksi, this method works. That's a big difference can be used to activate certain the brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body by hand.
In La Jolla, California, the Salk Institute researcher Sreekanth Chalasani told The Guardian for, that the method may one day replace deep brain stimulation. It's invasive procedure, which the human brain are led by electrical impulses to treat Parkinson's disease.
Do not normally nematode reacts to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they are surrounded by liquid, which is small microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He found that the bubbles have confirmed the ultrasonic waves, which then go in the worms.
The ultrasonic waves, affect 4's ion channels structures, which has some of the cell membranes.
Sound waves get these ion channels to open up and attached to activate the cells, told the journal Nature Communications journal published a report.
To prepare with ultrasound steered nematodes, Chalasani adapted worms genetically modified so that part of their nerve cells is 4's ion channels.
When Chalasani used an ultrasound custom built earthworms, micro bubbles confirmed sound waves and gave the earthworms, which they switch dressed on top of the motor neurons.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, cutting-edge tool, which will give scientists the opportunity to connect nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
Chalasani, however, says that sonota genetics there may be some benefits compared to optogenetics.
Unlike valo, who have to send an optical fibre along the desired) within the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can travel through the tissue of unchecked, so they can be sent to the brain's skull off.
"We believe that gene therapy and therapeutic virus using can't be possible to get the human nerve cells temporarily to react to ultrasonic signals in certain neurological treatment in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
The other where threats such as viruses can focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells, he added.

Eight golden rules to live on a student residence
It's been 11 years since I moved to the age of 19 unaware of the second year student dormitory. Then I believed I was still leopard skin and moral relativism, but only now I can remember ärsyttämieni constrained people smiles and a number of complaints, long remember.
A large part of the gathered at the school can be summed up to eight a simple rule.
Of constitutionalisation dormitory can be any nerves fair quite frightening.
Chatter is attractive: Tell me where you're from, did you like a gap year and where, what do you think Corbynista, and why "quite seriously, I don't love or hate a draft of the Marmite brew because really it's just yeast extract HAHAHA me find my room."
Take a breath.
And help the other to take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It is driven by a debate and help you find those people that you like, and those for whom even if you don't want to talk to your lashes are on fire extinguishers and they share.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often a cocktail party, movie nights for holding and YLE recreational opportunities, but they are also one of the places where people dress and corrective underwear.
On this subject: Don't even imagine a start-up University while partnership
University is a tough place introvert.
Your room should be resting place, but many hostels of migration from the room to another culture, which is a friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It can mean the hell to someone who is trying to get some rest.
None of this culture does not give you permission to say "I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but you have to leave now that I can to collect back energy that I spent in my conversations with you."
Try to sense when student guy a junk is tired and maybe send a text message to the door knocking instead.
Of knocking when it came to the speech: knock.
One guy university housing was the view that if the door was unlocked, he was invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends through baking.
Because you start university in peak periods leipomistrendin, people's doors knocking chocolate Leivo plate himself with the presentation and appears somewhat less strange, less "Welcome to the neighborhood, I made you something, I smile when I ask you some personal issues" - 1950s.
Self-made food provision is a great way to make friends.
Your partner feel obliged to talk to, and may be that they continue to connect your face tasty gun surprise.
This of course, depends on it, you know how to bake.
Poorly mixed Sugar Fat blob flour are likely to be the only people who pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common criminal living in student dorms.
Understandably, the chicken to someone's stealing, but what if you take a drop of milk tea?
Ask and check your milk from the owner.
It is quite possible that they give you permission, while boiling internally.
If someone steals your thing, it is annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to take that adult more than my dormitory friends who mixed up their milk detergent to punish those who stole it.
He is now in prison.
You should not make noise, so that people are not allowed to sleep or studying.
Not only to be a decent human being, but because you're like the proverb pata finding mass pot.
In my hallway neighbor girl asked if they call drum and bass music so loud, because it was three o'clock in the morning and he was a test in the morning.
The answer was to turn the volume up.
When they eventually slowed down at five in the morning, she kindly gave them sleep two hours before he put his own music, the roaring of the locked their doors and left three hours exam.
It would not be romantic, if the future of your partner were to change at the same dormitory with you?
Or conversely, it would not be an incredibly awkward, if you like I live Tola partner next his wife, 'd hook up with Terry, you separated, and then you could see him every day and possibly losing all common friend to him.
Of course, the heart wants what he wants, but if hot I live Tola partner is certainly not the future of your partner, you could even try to talk sense alapin.
In the hilarious moment when you notice that someone has left his keys unlocked room, the line between playing pranks and bullying is thinner than it appears.
A good prank is funny, but it is reversible overnight.
You can give a useful and fun safety education by hiding something but don't ever leave some room toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys of a glass of water, which then you put in the freezer - but don't pay their property blue sticker through the roof as no more than twice.

Sixten Korkman wrote chapter of the capital - the paper: "Marx is worth a look at."
The global economic crises have brought to the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work published in 1867-1894, the capital, writes as a former chairman of the Communist Party, a well-known yrjö hakanen paper published today the timeliness of Marx's Capital.
"He will now be taken more seriously than a long time," Hakanen writes foreword.
Marx's estimates of the capitalist economy of development, and the access by more and more widely to all areas of life, capital concentration and imaginary money capital and the growing role of the capital have proved remarkably visionary.
Organised by the hook capital seminars the writer of the list can be found in a book based on the University's professor, a respected economic experts Sixten Korkman.
The paper Korkman writes Marx was timely "now and forever."
You don't think the Research Institute and former business delegation, however, the executive director of the Marxist not?
At least there is no.
Korkman says on the phone, he doesn't like Marx timely economic thinkers, but rather as an attractive social theorists.
Today, the social sciences are segregated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, a historian, the sociologist, an economist, a journalist, political agitator and knowledge of literature.
"The usual perception is that intellectual history says the dead men's distort the views," Korkman start.
It is true that Marx's predictions were drastically wrong.
Although Marx understood the industrial revolution and the nature of the importance of capitalism, he pulled the beginning of the journey too far exporting conclusions Korkman wonders.
But Korkman, however, sees value Marx's radical mentality.
"More relevant Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now will be discussed again Marx interests such as wealth distribution.
"Marx may be able to provide inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, technical upheaval as a result, changing the world," Korkman analysed.
But that's what the government should tomorrow to decide, not Marx to not help.
His Miele capitalism was a hopeless case, which should just stop.
Still, Marx korkman believes that it is worth a look at.
"In the 1970s Marx couldn't read," Korkman says.
"The Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects hated all capitalism, but still more to each other."
Today, the debate is more varied, and the Marx can approach without back the years of ideological and political baggage.
"Every sociologists should have access to Marx, the idea of the world - like other classics," Korkman says.

Traffic is expected to be standing on the morning until early evening.
Arriving from elsewhere as a result of the demonstrators in Helsinki is also becoming a lot of charter buses.
They will not be allowed to enter the railroad.
The buses are basically kind of consensus.
Then have to walk the rest of the site of the demonstration, "Kujala says.
A demonstration to stop in the public transport.
The police perspective this is the positive side effect.
Public transport flow issue, which is normally available in these big at the gatherings, can be now, then the 200810 themselves.
The organisers of protest have informed police that Helsinki could be tens of thousands of government opponents of economic policy.
Police expect of protest to go quietly.
People are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, the Finns sensible and peaceful people are, "Kujala says.
Across the country will be held on Friday, the local protests.
Friday's demonstration in many ways, is an exceptional - do you remember these strikes and protests?
Organised by trade unions on Friday, a big demonstration in many ways is an interesting and unusual.
It is, for example, found in the political history, very good benchmark, says Jyväskylän University sociology professor emeritus of Martti Siisiäinen.
In itself is not surprising that the trade union movement protested.
If it does not do so, it would raise the government in front of their hands up, Siisiäinen says.
Very right-wing government has hit the heart of corporatism tradition - and the sort of points that have been the welfare state in the development of the important.
The government's tough approach is a lack of contract law.
This is a lot of features to the fact that the trade union movement really trying to get to its knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement in the mirror is watching the place.
The Mirror is needed, for example, because of that trade union movement by no means all the support of Friday's demonstrations.
New is now the sharp division between a demonstration, which will bring with it there, which the trade union movement would not want to take part in the demonstration.
Across the country gathered unemployed people protested in the parliament building in November 1993.
If Friday's statement we have is looking for the benchmark, could it be mind shows left the unemployed, in 1993, organised adolescence Thursday, siisiäinen says.
In the middle of the deepest recession in adolescence Thursday was the subject of one of the 20 000 unemployed.
The number of ( centre), the government stumbled the social crisis to another.
It said that the government and the employee relations were never previously been as bad as the number of during the Conservative government.
Now the government and trade union movement, relations are perhaps even worse than adolescence Thursday in a long time.
Besides, in power is now the very right of centre government ever, Siisiäinen says.
The current governing coalition is still in a way interesting that it is so tight, despite right-wing rhetoric the True Finns.
Yet a big splash at the time of the old Labour movement was certain elements.
It is expected to attend on Friday, several thousand demonstrators.
A demonstration to stop the public transport and closes, potentially, nurseries and schools.
Even though a demonstration will be the undivided support, it can become the biggest in years.
In Helsinki in recent years has been the subject of approximately 300 protests every year.
They have a whole range.
Traditionally, Finnish trade union movement of the demonstrations have been very calm - even if practices have deteriorated in recent years.
Traditionally, in the demonstration to avoid conflict, we are law-abiding.
The protesters are trying to avoid harm or destruction of property, Siisiäinen says.
The end of the 1990s, however, brought to the new directions.
Protest culture has changed.
EU membership by the farmers to throw eggs and police would be looking to get on top pigshit.

The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995

The threat of mass resignations were driven by the negotiations in the end result.
Doctors went on strike in 2001

The media researcher: Sipilä, take a big risk
Sipilä, communication, we need a diverse range of channels, and the prime minister's television and radio speeches are one of the Channel, among others.
In such a direct speech on the channel is needed in the future.
This is not going to stay in the last time, he told reporters in Parliament.
He did not want to assess how often repeated way the Prime Minister's television and radio speech will be.
Sipilä, according to the rhetoric does not necessarily always ignored in the future of the channels.
If other channels as a conduit for reports, so we'll see.
Now is used this channel this evening, he said.
Sipilä, according to the state of the economy is so serious that it requires the television and radio speech marketing citizens.
This issue, what we are talking about, is quite complex and requires a longer period of argument.
That's why we came up with this channel of, he explained.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 in TV1 and that the radio in Finland.
It can also look at the arena.
Sipilä, take a big risk
The media researcher hopes that the TV script Sipilä, tell me more general government inwards reversing this trend.
Is an effort to take the public debate on the right to define tightly into their own hands, and ways to refuse public debate? Wonders of the Stockholm University Professor Anu Koivunen.
It comes to mind the secretary of state ( Timo) Soini recent comment that she comply with the media agenda and not let it define themselves.
Democratic debate and in the name of the publicity I hope that these things are not related.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is outraged Sipilä announcement.
It would be strange if media environment did not react.
Policymakers are not things to say communication styles in a democracy.
The representatives of the media is by definition, to try to ensure that politicians agendas are not given.
Koivunen Sipilä, according to the TV script is a big risk.
Sipilä should be in a speech to bring down something new and special, so that speech the exceptionally high expectations are fulfilled.
Today, there is more what we have already heard?
Or will he be able to speak to a different tone, in a different way, or different I said or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there's just more of the same old, have to wonder why such a great gesture was made and the YLE gave it an extraordinary time.
YLE had to take this risk in that sense, if it is not a special situation but the routine among others.
The danger is that the politicians are labeled or speaker of parliament and government in the media, which is certainly not the interests or the public in the line.
Sipilä a clever move
The forthcoming speech Sipilä, it is important too, what the prime minister not to say, the media researcher stressed.
In the evening will be to look carefully at what he is missing and what not, says Jyväskylän University research coordinator Heikki pup.
Kuutinkanava tv-speech is Sipilä, according to a clever move, because this is how it will be able to bring their own views up without any dissenting voices.
This message will be a big audience without journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference, where journalists can make the critical issues.
Sipilä to bypass the media and speaks directly to people.
However, there is a risk that the media will interpret speech something wrong, because going questions is to get to.
Kuutinkanava says it is very important, how Sipilä appears on TV - we spend perspiration, my hands are shaking hands.
He compares Sipilä father figure, who is now telling people what to do.
If he can present themselves well, it can work.
The situation is different than at the time, if the government to communicate something, because this person as if speaking directly to another person.
This kind of ( US President Barack) Obama and partners have regularly.
A truly exceptional
Political scientist ERK crevasse to keep the prime minister said the public really exceptional.

Psychologist advises: So you tell children refugees
Many parents have had in recent days to think about how to tell the child into the numbers of refugees of the situation.
Or is it worth it to tell at all?
There was no need to take to force the phrases on the team member, a psychologist Ferdinand garofita advises.
The smaller children is worth protecting, for example, and let them watch news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they saw, and it can stay in rolling out and make, he says.
If a child, however, has discovered a television news images of the refugees or heard about it from elsewhere, it should be taken up.
The debate is good to go to the child's terms and to listen carefully to what he asks.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily those older thinks he's afraid of.
Children should not be bullied in vain, although the haunting yourself and you're terrified.
Lower the child will closely monitor the behaviour of their parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the debate, every child feels safe.
The bigger children are refugees to the debate is likely to be at school, with the boys or online.
Parents have a good thing to take with them up, if it is children.
The truth is that all people in the world have things well.
Parents can, together with children to think about how our family this is going to be taken.
Is the world in our view, ultimately, however, safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational point of view - some people may want to protect their children as much as possible to fear.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about the difficult issues, the child gets to model for how to deal with life in front of future difficulties.
This can be beneficial to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help weaker."
At the end of their own forces?
You can still be your child a good parent

This is why you don't get rid of the futile the iPhone programmes
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least part of Apple's iPhone phones involved in the future of the programs can maybe sometimes in the future to remove - but not quite all.
Apple plans to potentially in the future of their own programmes, removing some of the iPhone phones, says the company's chief executive Tim Cook BuzzFeed magazine in an interview.
Apple's iPhone can be found in a series of programmes that relatively few people use: For example, a newsstand FaceTime calls, health, the stock exchange, podcasts and tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programmes is the Apple Watch, which became forced to updates iPhone phones, even if it is a necessary only Apple smartwatch owners.
Cook's Apple, according to the removal of the programmes is more complicated than meets the show.
Some apps have been linked to another of the iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems elsewhere on the phone, Cook says BuzzFeed.
Cook did not mention what Apple's iPhone applications are working closely together with other programmes.
There are other programmes that are not doing this.
So with the time, I think we can develop a way to give the user to remove them, Cook added.
Cook, according to Apple, are investigating the matter, because the company does not want to waste storage and retrieval unit iPhone phones users.

The US Fed is trying to tighten monetary policy next
The U.S. The next recession begins a peak of less than a year later, but likely within three years after the country's central bank, the Fed will start again after a long time to raise interest rates.
And financial markets, the rot begins, in turn, before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted at the start of the interest rate increases, possibly as early as this week, and by the end of the year.
So the next downturn could push on top of the highest seen by this autumn and the financial exchange rate crash it before.
Or at least that is what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets operate as they have been used to - and if they react to the Fed as racketeering, money will have done before.
Such conclusions have come up with the German bank, Deutsche Bank strategists in the London market research Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in a broad long-term market and in the economic study.
The bank distributors in more than 60 page the long term Asset Return Study - a report to international major customers last week.
The research and produced a report of strategists do not pretend that they know exactly when the Fed will start to raise interest rates or what the economy and markets happens after that.
Instead, they are cool facts and statistics estimates of how the economy and markets have previously been increases in interest rates the Fed, time and after them.
Historic observations in addition, they are looking at what the economic and financial markets in the key variables are now at the same or different shape than previous increases in interest rates to time - and what it potentially follow.
It is apparent that, as the economy than financial markets are now a shape to withstand the rise in interest rates earlier than at any time since the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not even a year
The Fed and its current state of the monetary policy stance will be decided by the leaders have throughout the last summer and early autumn, tried to insinuate that the time to be ripe to increase interest rates.
The first rate hike of more than nine years may come as early as this week.
There will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the Fed board so-called sector will meet to decide on the matter of the two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed picked up the so-called Fed funds interest rate in June 2006.
Then it ended exactly two years of relatively regular but at a time for small 0.25 percentage point to a series of increases in interest rates, which the Fed raised interest rates 1.25 percent to 5.25 percent.
The financial symptoms began in 2007, the United States, the riskier housing finance, and years later, the financial crisis was torn into a global doomsday into a nightmare.
The great recession was in 2009.
Last time the financial and real serious setbacks began at a slower pace than previous increases in interest rates after the Fed has typically been the case.
Similarly, the test were then harsher and more than at any time since the 1930s depression.
Deutschen strategists are elimination of the world's largest economies, as well as the highs and lows of the financial events since 1950 and in some places ever since the beginning of the 19th century.
The Fed rate hikes and their economic and the financial impact they have accounted for since the 1950s.
The start of the recession is the first of those who decided to raise interest rates now at the fastest time of less than a year, mostly in less than three years and an average of less than three and a half years.
Financial market prices have closed a year or two later, the Fed start of the increases in interest rates.
The Fed has alternately raised and in the 1950s, cut its fallen since the start of a dozen different length of the cycle.
Each time is called in some respects, others, and times to the review is relatively tight, so on the basis of their hardly suggests nothing is certain the effects of increases in interest rates.
Strategists resemble that this time, a lot has changed.
Not only better.
Interest rates too low for too long
Decisive factors in the financial crisis, let alone the culprits may not be conclusively out even after decades of research.
But three points of the crisis and the juggernaut that most increased reasons will be somewhat indisputably clear:
1) The Fed, the euro area, the ECB and the rest of the world's major central banks were too long in the 21st century rates too low.
They paikkailivat the techno-bubble traces, and raised at the same time, the next.
2) Finance and different parts of the real economy, accumulated over the decades and the already excessive indebtedness grew ylilöysän central banks of the impact of monetary policy even higher.
Until then, was born in the history of the biggest debt bubble.
3), especially in the financial economy roughly pidäkkeittä inflated packed mad cheap debt financing for most of the financial areas of economic history until then, the biggest the rate bubbles shares in property, bonds and commodities.
There is unlikely there will be very fierce controversy, that more and more complex leverage heights on rising financial markets were unusually dangerous and unstable position today, when the Fed and other central banks, most recently, drove interest rates upwards.
On leverage primed financial structures, let alone valuation bubble did not survive as a certain amount of time after the interest rate increases were begun and debt financing costs were on the rise.
The risks were as a financial, and it was followed by the Great Recession.
A bigger bubble and more debt
Deutschen strategists do not guess what happens next, but give been thinking subject, for example, by mentioning facts such as the following:
1) the Fed and other major central banks are now believed to be its monetary policy stance yet lighter even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were before the crisis for too long too low, they have now been even longer even lower.
2) debt does not have long been mad cheap as ten years ago, but now has the lowest price of debt money literally cheaper than express.
So, financial and real debt load does not have a lighter, but now mired in different parts of the economy plenty of heavier debt load than before the financial crisis or its half never before.
3) more and more rapid and less costly central banks issued left liquidity has largely been financial market and key hilannut securities and asset allocation is the most expensive during the previous peak in the financial crisis, then or never.
And strategists LVL atmosphere just a financial market signs, but they also point out that even the U.S. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and recession in decades, the most burdensome to the model as has happened in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
The real economy is in other words, an unusually poor shape but similarly, the financial pressures and risks incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed's next will start to tighten further money taps tightness.
Perhaps the French bank Societe Generale a strategist Albert Edwards of the future of the picture is not as weird as at first glance may seem.
He is already a good time have been trained by the Bank's International investor-clients fed the following a difficulties:
First, the Fed to raise interest rates, then the financial bubble burst - and soon the Fed's look at the time to turn off the financial fires even larger QE provision of money.

Ahtisaari, the Guardian: The West have rejected the Russian proposal overthrowing Assad
The West have rejected more than three years ago, the Russian offer, which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have been to relinquish power, says president Martti Ahtisaari, the Guardian for.
According to the Russian UN envoy has suggested the plan, which Assad would be some time after receded from power in style.
The West, however, did not come to grips with the proposal, because they believed Assad to fail anyway a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012, the UN Security Council with the five permanent members of.
According to the Russian ambassador Vitaly Tshurkin listed him in a face-to-face debate three point plan: The opposition was not allowed to arm, the opposition and Assad had to immediately get between speech connection and al-Assad from power of the Treasury had to take the discreet.
I know tshurkin.
We may not agree on all of them, but we will be able to discuss openly.
I told him what I did there and he said that sit down, Murray, so I'll tell you what we need to do, Ahtisaari remembers in an interview with The Guardian.
Diplomats have not commented on
The academy says conveyed tshurkin message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the page content of the debate, but Ahtisaari, it is not two words.
The UN diplomats refused to do so on the allegations but said that Assad's forces were already at that time have made a series of massacres and the main opposition groups refused to all the agreements, which he had been in power.
The British Foreign Office the Middle East title, a former leader Sir John Jenkins takes Ahtisaari rhetoric hesitant because of his experience, according to Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Assad.
Officially, Russia has backed al-Assad for the entire war.
The weakest argument is that Tshurkin said Moscow with a mandate.
If he had told me tshurkin speeches, I would have answered that I want to hear the same President Vladimir Putin, so I can take it seriously.
Jenkins says he would be there, too, suspects that it would have been Putin's trick to power in one supporter of Assad.
The flow of refugees own-resources gone that way
During the negotiations between the Syrian crisis had been about 7,500 people.
The UN estimates that the death toll in excess of 220 000 at the start of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe's own-resources did that.
I see no other option than to keep these poor people good care of.
We are now paying the bill, which we have done themselves, the academy says the page.

The Prime Minister Juha Sipilä ( centre). In the public, according to a halving of the holiday money would be responsible for only part of the government from seeking a job to lower the price.
The government to take, however, he said, delighted to receive option package, if the social partners succeed in a fit.
He said the journalists in Parliament that he has not been in contact with social organizations.
He also does not know how seriously they are looking for alternative ways of working to blackmail the government has announced.
If this agreement is reached, we'll take it, of course, welcome as part of the package.
Halving the holiday money would be Sipilä believes that as a way of working, because it would focus on almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government proposed by the Sunday supplements the surgery.
The social partners to be able to agree to cut holiday money, because they have been recorded in the law, rather than the collective bargaining.
The government says the likely next week's parliament on Wednesday to Labour to blackmail of the government.
Organisations Sipilä, according to the proposals should have known this before.
The final deadline is not all of this is not.
The legislation leaves at the start of the train is on the move and it goes all the time it more difficult.
Now it is a very long time.
After all, in matters such as this long to go, if the will is there, he said.
The government last week by publishing the list is, among other things, Twelfth Night and Ascension Day constitutionalisation unpaid free days shortening annual working hours.
In addition, the first paid sick days will be cut, a cut in half, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75 percent and holidays will be reduced.

The U.S. central bank policy makers are this week, two days surrounded by a huge mahogany table long-awaited meeting, deciding whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
The other end of the central bank's decorative, two-storey is hunted mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the central bank, Janet Yellen, President of the Los Angeles, and his colleagues should be on the nation's economic interests above all else.
Congress has fallen on the shoulders of the central bank, a dual responsibility: They will have to maximize employment and the United States to keep prices stable.
After the Great Depression in the central bank leaders, however, have accepted that there is also the third, the unspoken mandate: economic stability.
It is this the third requirement can be a key decision which will be published on Thursday, which is so tight that it is not even be able to predict. The decision about whether the US economy ready weaned unprecedented stimulus, which at the end of the year until 2008, stayed near zero short-term interest rates has brought.
Although the majority of the data shows the economy to grow steadily, the recent turmoil in the global financial markets can be done in advance of the wary of the central bank officials ex-article säikymmiksi, what will be greater volatility. There are fears, how would, if the federal funds rate - the benchmark even percentage point increase in the quarter.
"Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors, which will be monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, brokerage business Nikolaus Stifel & Co's The Alou expert on heads.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for the legitimacy of the interest rate unchanged for lodging, increased uncertainty in global markets has enough valid argument is still waiting for," he says.
Central Bank's decision is not reached an agreement, which already nervous about it, too, to give birth to the economy.
Agency, according to a recent study of about half of the economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets, meanwhile, expect that the central bank to delay the increase, because, according to the possibility of a key indicator of growth is only about 30 percent.
This refers to the stock market decline if the central bank to raise the level of, if policy makers and then failed to soften the blow by promising that the increases will not happen in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, a new chapter in the 16 599.85.
The recovery brought the wait for the fact that the central bank to keep a level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group the Alou expert on heads uen group.
"It is surprising, if the central bank to raise interest rates right now," he says.
If policy makers will raise interest rates, "they need to see a lot of effort into policies and guidelines in order to support the financial markets, so that they don't panic."
Some experts argue that the elevated level to reassure financial markets, because it would remove uncertainty about when the central bank works.
Just a month ago it seemed that the central bank would be in this month, raising interest rates a quarter of a percentage point, so taking the first small step towards monetary tightening up space in the slow, which to certify the stability of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen has said in the spring and early summer, that he expected the level to rise this year, despite the fact that liberals are calling for appeals more economic development.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, which is the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level of which the central bank to full employment, the limit.
Wage growth has shown signs of a pickup.
Even though inflation is still below the central bank's 2 percent of the annual target, the central bank policy makers, according to the main reason for this is a lowered the price of oil in a temporary effect.
The economy "comes out of the cases even major for interest rate levels and also needs them, taking into account a tough situation of the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics - the company's The Alou expert on heads.
Financial markets around the world, however, the global economy shaken last week, when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index fell by up to 16 percent in May to record on, when investors feared China to slow down the economy to slow global growth.
Markets are this month, recovered somewhat, and the Dow index is now almost 10 percent below the record high in May.
The central bank policy makers to market turmoil has aspect of this complex equation, which says because interest rates will increase.
"Without these financial market events and the last few weeks, the news of China's economic weakness, policy makers would tighten this level of the meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Zima Center for Real Estate - the centre of the senior researcher and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that policy makers are waiting for at least a month in order to get a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the U.S. economy are still very unclear, and they have no information at their disposal, what will be the consequences of events," Oliner says.
The international economic well-being is not the key concerns of the central bank, so basically, it should not affect the decision-making process.
In practice, the federal government's central bank, however, has become the world's the money authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence is enormous.
In 2013, the former chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, suggesting that the central bank can "to narrow the" increasing the amount of money, caused upheaval in markets around the world.
In the world, where the markets and economies are increasingly intertwined together, the central bank officials are expected not only the next development elsewhere, including consult experts and other central banks to get a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science," says Zachary Kara Bell asset management company Envestnet, Inc., head of global strategy.
The state of Virginia in Richmond, a Federal Reserve Bank ( the Federal Reserve Bank) President Jeffrey Lacker pointed out this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market unrest, which has had to be separate from the economic fundamentals."
Decisions for the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee has called for interest rate increase, and Lacker, voting member of the Committee, calls on as an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian financial crisis caused it, that the central bank has cut the reference value 0.75 percentage points to three during the meeting "despite its limited, identified the impact on the U.S. economic growth," Lacker said.
Years later, the central bank set aside these cuts.
The central bank should be put to economic stability a priority only during the crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, the Bank of England ( Bank of England) koronmäärittämiskomitean, a former member.
The latest turmoil will not come anywhere near that level, Posen says.
"No one wants such a situation where the interest rate increase is feared because of that market bothered," Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute president-in-office Posen says.
Federal law, the central bank ( the Federal Reserve Act) is still look like a twofold, and does not mention the financial stability. As long as this is the case, they do not believe there should be to predict it.

Bariatric surgery can help to put it mildly obese people with diabetes
A new study, according to the mildly obese type 2 for diabetics weight loss surgery the benefits can last for at least five years.
However, there is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics after weight loss surgery for longer than those that are treated in other ways as a cut.
"Mortality data to get to take a long time," Dr. Robin Blackstone says. He is the expert on slimming operation, who wrote the editorial to the new research periodical JAMA Surgery.
Slimming, or Tris Barr Issa surgery is used for different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce their hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatriset cuts has been found to be effective to treat type 2 diabetes, but the majority of those surveyed had a morbidly obese, and their BMI ( BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, or weight ratio length is considered normal, when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI of more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person's BMI is more than 30, he is thought to be obese.
You can put their own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
This new research for the researchers Taiwanese min Sheng General Hospital - in the hospital used data collected from 2007 to compare two kinds of Trista Barr surgery, gastric bypass and gastric reduction, type 2 diabetes for medical treatments in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that people cut the average BMI fell 37 from 24.5:een fifth by the end of the year.
At the same time, those who were being treated by means other than a cut, BMI remained roughly the same in 29.
The reduced 36 percent of diabetes improved altogether and 28 percent semi-milled.
For the sake of comparison, medicinally there in a group of diabetes improved altogether, only 1 percent and, in part, about 2 percent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, as well as the "bad" cholesterol in LDL "were generally better the surgical team," the authors said.
The researchers also followed the patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, blood sugar levels which reflect the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c - value should remain below 7 percent, the researchers write.
Surgery post-nice hemoglobin A1C - level fell around 9 percent to about 6 percent.
The medicinal treatment group, however, it remained stable at around 8 percent.
This better "glycemic control," which improved levels of hemoglobin A1c describe, did not reduce mortality rates five years, says principal investigator Dr. Chih Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the mean score of between two different surgery.
In the case for the fifth year, when it was compared with gastric pienennysleikkaukseen fermented group had gastric bypass group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), fallen body mass index more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased hemoglobin A1c, level of their more (3.1% and 2.1 percent), and was more likely to be achieved perfect diabetes Remi commission (46.9 procent and 16.7 percent).
University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix Blackstone, says that although the research does not seem to be producing survival or surgery after five years, there is a research findings from Sweden, where the surgery led to longer life the people.
A Swedish study found that to weight loss surgery visited obese was 29 percent less likely to die 15 year period, when they were compared with the group, which had tried traditional treatments.
Although a new study does not seem to be producing an improvement on surgery patients, survival, Blackstone, says that the results, however, are encouraging for people whose BMI is under the age of 35 and who are interested in surgery.
"The findings are crucial to precisely that they show that the surgery is safe for the group with lower body mass index," and has raised the death or the risk of kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take the weight very seriously at that stage, when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when the man has been collected by these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body obesity and diabetes, the cancellation of the situation is very difficult.

Why I'm going to prove his execution in Oklahoma
If any judicial intervention does not happen, later today, I think when the man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I sit in the gallery of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary - in prison for watching, when Richard Glossip executed lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the death of four official witnesses.
Receiver request in January, through her best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I started to abhor in this day its approaches.
So why I said yes?
I said yes, because I thought it would be a good way to tell the story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
The journalists, of course, is a chance to watch executions in America, and because the applications is often more than available seats, a sinister participants are selected via the lottery.
Oklahoma has reduced to the media reserved seats out of 12 to five.
Whoever then Val, believes the event cool.
I can't do it.
I'm gonna sit Richard sipinen positive impact next to the closest of friends, and I have also created her own connection to months of the telephone as well as one of two - and the half-hour through the visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often as we talked.
The prison authorities say, I can't be, as well as a witness that the journalist, so I may not be with me the notebook and pen save I've ever seen.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One oklahomalainen journalist accused on Twitter that I've compromised impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of his own way, so you get to participate.
I complained to a journalist.
He admitted that "would have been able to adjust his words better," but is still think that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has been a different view of some of my messages and I wrote with the issues.
He did not tell me what I will write, and I would do so even if he would say.
I told him that he can at any given time to remove me witness list.
But he wants to, that there is an international journalist who writes about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public to help the death penalty for the opposition trend.
The Huffington Post reporter Kim Bell Ware is by my side.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to a series of my podcasts.
I don't do this again all through the details.
I will not be able to say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His business Barry Van Treesen after the murder would make him in any case, guilty of the relief effort.
But I think that is a very strong chance of the fact that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe that the death penalty was sufficient evidence enough.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And so this is the point of view, which I watch him die.
I can't claim to be completely impartial.
There will be other journalists, who take care of it.
I get a description of what it feels like to see when the man, which I think, are dying unnecessarily.

Moody told Fairfax Media that his aim has always been to do it, what is best to competition, and that he has had a difficult situation lidar unexplained positive Cobalt visions do after.
He has had his tongue in check a spy that Øystein relationship and a half years, and didn't want that, "it would envy."
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I have long been quiet about it, but sometimes it frustrated so much that everything is dissolved in the first time," Moody said.
They knew that the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with it, what I have said.
I'm going home today and I sleep well.
I want to walk upright owners and I would like to think that I'll do my best for them.
When they are starting to think differently, then I should no longer continue to coach.
Then I'd have to consider what I do licence.
Earlier in the Moody significant negative effect on the bomb racing.com-sivuston in an interview in which he said that in its own dust Usos Aston had tried to spy on his Talia.
"And a half years ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting room with a man - I'll name him on the question of - and offered him work Tal, if he cares about what to do there.
They clearly think I'm a crook.
If the thing is, of course they would be separated from his lawyer, because they have failed my to catch.
Robert Roulstone, Racing Victoria, a former chairman, David Moodie, Racing Victoria, as well as the current chairman, Bernard Saundry, Racing Victoria's current chief executive, were all aware of the matter at the time, and are aware of it today.
Should I start to think that this is becoming personal?
Victoria's Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps to transfer responsibility for other than the coaches about what is happening in the field?
Am I detrimental to the sector?
Am I so detrimental to the sector?
Perhaps people think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me out, and I have no doubt that now I say things possibly get them to think of that.
But I am now at that point, I don't care anymore, and it grieve me.
It really saddens me.
I push them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back for this.
The coach's frustration has grown long lidar cobalt investigation as a result, and a late rejection prompted him to say that could "throw their licence over the table."
Moody, who is best known as the invincible champion Black Caviar, a race day, has called on the management of the rule "ridiculous" after the mud or clay tomb is put on a horse in ruins, which is unlawful.
"It is against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
One of the mud by mistake on my staff put it in the foot.
It would have been able to be a poultice last night.
It could be the last, as it was.
It was the race day.
Moody may be facing the three months of a race day, which is why a poultice treatment officials began their investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules, don't know anything about the horse.
"We all understand that the rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.

Melbourne Storm - the team coach Craig Bellamy attacks against rivals wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised two NRL Rugby League champion favorite claims that his team at that time, tackling would be part of the "line."
Sydney the Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the Storm have allowed the referees "wrestle" in their side, when it unexpectedly won the final qualifier in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett had barely cover reference storm after it won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night the final qualifier. Bennett called game rugby league "showcase" and said that two Queensland teams were "very enthusiastic" wrestling.
Bellamy defended the team in tackles and said that they just focus on "contact" tackled.
Bellamy added that his confidence has added to the two leading coach criticism of the storm, because it means that they are afraid to lose to the team.
"It always comes up - I heard Trent Robinson talking wrestling when we lost to them 24 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not exchanged any defence or technolo throughout the year. The last six weeks, we have only highlighted the contact tackles, and it has led us to thrive.
Trent has been the team three years, and he's obviously a great team coachee, so he is probably not used to losing, and so this was a small shock to him.
It's funny how it always comes up this time of year.
Bellamy challenged the idea of Bennett's "exciting rugby" by reminding a mentor for Bennett to coach St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "boring".
Wayne is an exciting rugby.
He was keen to compare our Friday night game Saturday night, the game and tell you how exciting their games was, "Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George, often criticised the fact that it's boring team, and Wayne said he could care less about.
But now he is the team who will be able to play the kind of rugby, which we consider to be exciting, especially when he's quick young friends.
In a game you want to play, when you have the type of players.
He brought it out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team is not friends such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, in order to play so.
I'm going to be more confident when they say such things, because they are a little bit worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't pay us the resistance to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the storm and the Roosters game was point of the rich than between Broncos and Cowboys staged.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I have not seen it yet, but how it ended? 12 16?
Our game was 20 18, so we had two goals more but is it exciting rugby?
Or will this exciting line of defence and the mark of failure to do so?
For me, this is about policy.
If they give us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
This weekend's storm in a free, because they have already won the right home game, either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla next Saturday night against shark organisms esifinaaliin Brea Park. Tickets are on sale next Tuesday morning.

The Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that the team mates have to support the injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb drawn
Wenger has also stressed the importance of Wilshire that now has until September and that's assuming he rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason why he would not be back playing by Christmas.
This is the case for the best of the Wilshire will be missed at least the next four of the English game, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he or she will participate in next summer, the European Championships.
The biggest shame in this latest problem is that Wilshere the end of last season was a strong individual after ankle injury, and he commemorated the old sharpness before the start of the season.
"This kind of injury is not a threat to a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone, which is not healed properly.
It's no surprise.
It was just an accident.
It is not linked to his ankles or previous injuries, what he has been.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as well as Wenger admitted the player's attempt to return to the middle period is always a risk of additional injuries.
It is also becoming uncomfortable model.
Premier injury Ltd - the company's research shows that Wilshere has been 23 different injury after he debuted six years ago.
In addition, he is the last five of the season played for Arsenal 157 to a league game just 65 of the game.
Arsenal viewing of a broader picture of the season since 2007-08, six of the season of the eight it's been one of the Premier League teams, which has lost the most days because of injury.
Wenger admits a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their last season injury statistics will continue their cure upon us.
"Sometimes when to return to the injury may be vulnerable to the season, when the need to strengthen the body and get the competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope that stabilizes his body, I am sure that happens, and that he can't make a career than he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle the team, when Arsenal to start the Champions League games on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb on computers since then, on Saturday, Chelsea ' ( a) and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be starting up.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Nacho Monreal, Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott instead.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give some breathing space it to those nostalgic for the players," Wenger said.
While Arsenal have a clear the sequel's favourite f-block European mirin stadium in Zagreb, is the frightening.
Dinamo is also not lost 41 of the game after they produced their own "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium shook Tuesday night, an earthquake, which was the magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learned the lessons of last season for the Champions League capitulation against Monaco, and he is motivated by becoming a distant dream to lead the team its first European Cup victory.

Friends Fest: sitcom, which taught us serious things men between the friendship
It is striking how similar descriptions is not the series, particularly given that men need to open up is more desperate than ever, and the young men of the suicide rate higher than the last 15 years.
2013 suicide was the biggest cause of death 20 45 olds men in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than women.
The company to address the problem Campaign Against Living Miserably ( CALM) announced in 2015 men in the years. The aim was to challenge the culture, which prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the challenge at the heart of the meeting.
In a recent study involved was more than 2000 secondary schools and pupils live, which showed depressive symptoms. According to the study, a person's chance to recover from doubled if high enough prosenttiosa his friends was "a healthy mind."
As well as those who were not depressed, the likelihood of any mental health problems, halved, if they were mentally healthy friends.
But in order to make friendship could work, it needs to be the first available.
In this through social media to communicate the content of the time the style is over and answer a direct approach is often more important than meaningful human contact.
Digital Life to have nearly doubled the necessary seems strong, happy and successful, although in reality, isolation is dominated by.
This superficial success are dominated by values, which psychologists call external: The money, image, social status. All this is internal values - the desire for personal growth and friendship - at the expense of depth, which affect mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer, recently explained the money really cannot be greater happiness.
Friends of gentility was right there, that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the figures are not defined their work, but rather their personality, which departed much interaction with friends.
Joey and Chandler's many hugs, moments from comfortable chairs watching football, Ross Miss Rachel - these comedy came in the knowledge that yes, men can identify with all of this, even though they often hesitate to explore their feelings perfectly.
As the Samaritans volunteer explained to me: "Listening to people who are depressed and suicidal, I'm really understand how any interaction with a friend can't make you feel better."
Often contact us to take the men feel that they can talk to friends.
The old adage "more than of getting" is a strong, as well as feeling that if the window of the problems, is seen as weak.
Friends is one of the series, which comes to mind when I'm trying to offer longer-term survival.
It was highlighted by the men of friendship between the little moments.
Although unpartisan, outside the station at the end of the phone to help people moments of despair, long-term support comes from the nearby, personal family and friends of the network.
And so, if you are taking part in the Comedy Central friend what a tee this weekend, and all of the filming locations is in honour of the planned retabled, why don't you take your friends for coffee Central Perk.
Or, better still, if you see at Starbucks someone a lonely, smile and say hello.
You can never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be sent to the start of the Comedy Central in the end, all 236 episodes, part of # friends Fest '
