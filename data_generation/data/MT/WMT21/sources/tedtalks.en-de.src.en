I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that, by far, most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light.
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes.
The Sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected off the Moon.
And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the known universe has come to us through light, across vast eras in cosmic history.
And with all of our modern telescopes, we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang.
And yet, the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent.
I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself, because space can wobble like a drum.
It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.
Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition.
And while we've never heard the sounds from space, we really should, in the next few years, start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.
So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have, because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song, which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like.
We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background, but we haven't yet.
And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen, and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.
But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space.
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Now even light will be bent by those paths.
And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun, as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.
These are the natural curves in space.
What Einstein did not realize was that, if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across, you would make a black hole, an object so dense that if light veered too close, it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe.
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.
He did not believe they existed in nature.
He thought nature would protect us from their formation.
It was decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime.
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.
It's actually not massive enough.
But if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers, and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit, maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun.
And it would be self-illuminated, because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light -- so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.
And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.
It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan.
So we move this Earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.
There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but you actually have to get very close to fall in.
But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind the black hole.
The light from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it's not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.
We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape.
But even though the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark on the inside, because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.
And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience.
(Laughter) And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they're not seen.
Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.
Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the Sun.
So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second.
At the end of their lives, they're going around each other very near the speed of light.
So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and as they do so, they not only curve space, but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space, an actual wave on space-time.
Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.
This was one of the groups.
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other, again, with these helpfully painted curves.
And if you can see -- it's kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out, those are the gravitational waves.
They're literally the sounds of space ringing, and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning, quiet black hole at the end of the day.
If you were standing near enough, your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space.
You would literally hear the sound.
Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully, so you might have trouble understanding what's going on.
But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict.
This is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close.
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.
And we can predict what the sound will be.
We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder.
And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.
Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic.
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.
It's sort of like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I'm not showing you any images, because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink, and space is not painted, showing you the curves.
But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this, you want to get moving.
(Laughter) Want to get away from the sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer together.
In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.
And then they're going to merge.
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end.
Now that's our prediction for what we'll see.
Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.
And surely, somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged.
And surely, the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years, at the speed of light to get to us.
But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.
There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth -- one called LIGO -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers.
It's a remarkably ambitious experiment, and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up.
There's also a mission proposed for space, which hopefully will launch in the next ten years, called LISA.
And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun.
In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.
They look like they're frozen in some embrace.
And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core.
But they're not frozen; they're actually merging.
These two black holes are colliding, and they will merge over a billion-year time scale.
It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration.
But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe's history, the last 15 minutes before they fall together.
And it's not just black holes, but it's also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
When that expression was coined, it was derisive -- like, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.
We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.
So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
It's everywhere, it's all around you, and the space is wobbling chaotically.
Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us.
Galaxies form, and generations of stars form in those galaxies, and around one star, at least one star, is a habitable planet.
And here we are frantically building these experiments, doing these calculations, writing these computer codes.
Imagine a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
That song has been ringing through space for all that time.
We weren't even here.
It gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.
If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up, it would sound like this.
It's literally the definition of noise.
It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.
But it's around us everywhere, presumably, if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe.
And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation, of our observable universe.
So within the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit, render the universe in audio.
But if we detect those earliest moments, it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.
If we run the movie of our universe backwards, we know that there was a Big Bang in our past, and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it, but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?
Will it happen again?
I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever.
But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history?
Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us?
So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse, are there creatures?
Here's my multiverse creatures.
Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about us and wondering about their own origins?
And if they are, I can imagine them as we are, calculating, writing computer code, building instruments, trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
Many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see.
A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task, until now.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired.
So before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself.
You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination fully autonomously.
So in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition.
So about that time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently.
We decided to give it a try, because we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?"
We have already an autonomous vehicle.
We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?
(Laughter) We couldn't have been more wrong.
What NFB wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
So we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch.
So to test this crazy idea, we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment, in a flat, closed-off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a rather complex system, but let me try to explain it, maybe simplify it.
So we have three steps.
We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Now obviously the driver cannot see, so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.
For that, we use an initial measurement unit.
So it measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like a human ear, inner ear.
We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car.
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser range finders.
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles -- a car approaching from the front, the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads, any obstacles around the vehicle.
So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.
One is, first of all, process this information to have an understanding of the environment -- these are the lanes of the road, there's the obstacles -- and convey this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car.
So we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle.
But the problem is this: How do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive?
So for this, we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology.
So starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip, even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot.
But today we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interfaces.
Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip.
So these are a pair of gloves, and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer -- the direction and the intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
So this is a chair -- as a matter of fact, it's actually a massage chair.
We gut it out, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns, and we actuate them to convey information about the speed, and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal.
So over here, you can see how the computer understands the environment, and because you cannot see the vibration, we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening.
This is the sensory data, and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer.
So these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip, are very effective.
But the problem is these are instructional cue devices.
So this is not really freedom, right?
The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, speed up, stop.
We call this the "backseat-driver problem."
So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices, and we're now focusing more on the informational devices.
A good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called AirPix.
So think of it as a monitor for the blind.
So it's a small tablet, has many holes in it, and compressed air comes out, so it can actually draw images.
So even though you are blind, you can put your hand over it, you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles.
Actually, you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature.
So it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
So here you can see the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix.
For this, we're showing a simulator, a blind person driving using the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
So basically that's how it works.
But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle, and it's not going to be on the road until it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle.
And I truly believe that this can happen.
But still, will the society, would they accept such a radical idea?
How are we going to handle insurance?
How are we going to issue driver's licenses?
There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project.
The sensors that are used can see through the dark, the fog and rain.
And together with this new type of interfaces, we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people.
Or for the blind, everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting, in the office setting.
Just imagine, in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what's written and read using these non-visual interfaces.
This is priceless.
So today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
As an artist, connection is very important to me.
Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.
The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg, that they're isolated, that they're separate and alone, much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.
But the reality is far from it.
As an iceberg melts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life.
I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again.
It is not a death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life.
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old.
And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.
It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling.
So here it is.
You can see on the left side a small boat.
That's about a 15-foot boat.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline.
You can see here, it begins to roll, and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.
It's about 120 feet above the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is real time.
(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?
There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about -- a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are a real bugger.
They're really difficult for plants to produce.
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.
Why would they go to that bother?
And the answer of course, like so many things in the world, is sex.
I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.
And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important -- there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.
You can take cuttings; they can sort of have sex with themselves; they can pollinate themselves.
But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches.
Evolution works that way.
Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these.
And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen, and that's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets up our noses so much.
Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it, hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells, which are held within the pollen, will somehow reach another flower just by chance.
So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops, and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen.
But most species actually use insects to do their bidding, and that's more intelligent in a way, because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.
The insects and other species can take the pollen, transfer it directly to where it's required.
So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship between insects and plants.
There's a symbiotic relationship there, whether it's flies or birds or bees, they're getting something in return, and that something in return is generally nectar.
Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations -- the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets something, and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.
Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way.
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it, the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.
And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws, and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out, getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.
Orchids: there are 20,000, at least, species of orchids -- amazingly, amazingly diverse.
And they get up to all sorts of tricks.
They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid.
And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar.
And Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with this."
And sure enough, there's the insect.
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away, but in its erect form, that's what it looks like.
Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators, then, just as in human sex, people might start to deceive.
They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"
Now this is a plant.
This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love, and they've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom.
And this is the mimic.
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.
And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card.
(Laughter) Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.
This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot.
(Laughter) And when the insect gets there and lands on it, dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant, if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture, you can see that there are actually some patterning there, which is three-dimensional.
So it probably even feels good for the insect, as well as looking good.
And these electron microscope pictures -- here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye, have very, very different textures to what an insect might perceive.
And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles.
And under the scanning electron microscope, you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even to us.
I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful, amazing thing.
This one's clever. It's called obsidian.
I think of it as insidium sometimes.
To the right species of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee, and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away, and, of course, covers itself with pollen.
The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects.
And this one doesn't have anything for them.
So it's deceiving on two levels -- fabulous.
(Laughter) Here we see ylang ylang, the component of many perfumes.
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.
And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.
They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that'll have it.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that really, really smells pretty nasty and is designed, again, evolved, to look like carrion.
So flies love this.
They fly in and they pollinate.
This, which is helicodiceros, is also known as dead horse arum.
I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like, but this one probably smells pretty much like it.
It's really horrible.
And blowflies just can't help themselves.
They fly into this thing, and they fly all the way down it.
They lay their eggs in it, thinking it's a nice bit of carrion, and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die, but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited, because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.
Here's arum, arum maculatum, "lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.
This thing heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature -- amazing.
And if you look down into it, there's this sort of dam past the spadix, flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container.
They drink this fabulous nectar and then they're all a bit sticky.
At night they get covered in pollen, which showers down over them, and then the bristles that we saw above, they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen -- fabulous thing.
Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.
This is the philodendron selloum.
For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long.
And it does something that no other plant that I know of does, and that is that when it flowers -- that's the spadix in the middle there -- for a period of about two days, it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals.
So instead of having starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it's burning fat, metabolizing, about the rate of a small cat.
And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight, than a hummingbird -- absolutely astonishing.
This thing does something else which is unusual.
Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days, but it keeps constant temperature.
There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature.
Now why does it do this, I hear you ask.
Now wouldn't you know it, there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.
And they get inside, and they get it all on.
(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and off they go and pollinate.
And what a wonderful thing it is.
Now most pollinators that we think about are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate.
And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue and see that spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they see various shades of ultraviolet.
So there's something that goes on off the end there.
And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is, I hear you ask.
Well yes we can.
So what is an insect seeing?
Last week I took these pictures of rock rose, helianthemum, in Dorset.
These are little yellow flowers like we all see, little yellow flowers all over the place.
And this is what it looks like with visible light.
This is what it looks like if you take out the red.
Most bees don't perceive red.
And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very, very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what I got.
And that's a real fantastic bull's eye.
Now we don't know exactly what a bee sees, any more than you know what I'm seeing when I call this red.
We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's -- another human being's mind.
But the contrast will look something like that, so standing out a lot from the background.
Here's another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators.
And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.
Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed -- then under ultraviolet light, look at that.
And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful.
Finally, there's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern.
And I love the idea of something hidden.
I think there's something poetic here, that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter, the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus -- actually the clouds of Venus.
That's the main use of that filter.
Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility, which is the flower story.
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding, they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death, and particularly at marriage, which, when you think of it, is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Today I'd like to show you the future of the way we make things.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, replicating and repairing themselves.
So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare that to some natural systems.
So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [of assembly time], 500,000 to a million parts, fairly complex, new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years [of assembly time], 2.5 million parts.
But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems, we have proteins that have two million types, can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour.
So there's all of this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They're far more efficient in terms of energy.
They hardly ever make mistakes.
And they can repair themselves for longevity.
So there's something super interesting about natural systems.
And if we can translate that into our built environment, then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.
And I think the key to that is self-assembly.
So if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there's four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build -- so our buildings and machines.
And we need to decode that into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up, or reconfigure.
We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate, allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.
And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want.
So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.
The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot.
So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.
They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; so a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the string.
Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that, checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor.
So these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, designers that worked on this project.
And I think it really brings to light: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?
The next one questions that and looks at passive nature, or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability.
But it goes a step further, and it tries to have actual computation.
It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into your parts.
So this is a NAND gate.
You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One of them is the input from the user, as you're building your bricks.
The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.
And then it gives you an output in 3D space.
So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.
It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do.
And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down.
So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.
On the right-hand side, [0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.
And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.
So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.
So that means that we can have some form of self-replication.
In this case I call it self-guided replication, because your structure contains the exact blueprints.
If you have errors, you can replace a part.
All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one.
It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.
So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems.
So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system.
So basically you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical, and they're biased.
So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in -- so in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.
So you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively.
So what does this tell us about the future?
I think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, our buildings, machines.
There's new programmability in these parts.
And from that you have new possibilities for computing.
We'll have spatial computing.
Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines, all of our bricks could actually compute.
That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So it's exciting potential for this.
So I think these projects I've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future, if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution.
What's changed is we now can look at the evidence, we can compare societies, more and less equal societies, and see what inequality does.
I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist.
But first, see what a miserable lot we are.
(Laughter) I want to start though with a paradox.
This shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average.
And you see the countries on the right, like Norway and the USA, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.
There's no suggestion of a relationship there.
But if we look within our societies, there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society.
This, again, is life expectancy.
These are small areas of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top.
So income means something very important within our societies, and nothing between them.
The explanation of that paradox is that, within our societies, we're looking at relative income or social position, social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us.
And as soon as you've got that idea, you should immediately wonder: what happens if we widen the differences, or compress them, make the income differences bigger or smaller?
And that's what I'm going to show you.
I'm not using any hypothetical data.
I'm taking data from the U.N. -- it's the same as the World Bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies.
The measure we've used, because it's easy to understand and you can download it, is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country.
And you see in the more equal countries on the left -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.
But on the more unequal end -- U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore -- the differences are twice as big.
On that measure, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.
We collected data on problems with social gradients, the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, on kids' maths and literacy scores, on infant mortality rates, homicide rates, proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates, levels of trust, obesity, mental illness -- which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility.
We put them all in one index.
They're all weighted equally.
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.
And there, you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you, which I shall use over and over again in the data.
The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems.
It's an extraordinarily close correlation.
But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, gross national income, there's nothing there, no correlation anymore.
We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence, so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being.
It has 40 different components put together by other people.
It contains whether kids can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.
Everything goes into it.
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.
Highly significant relationship.
But once again, if you look at that measure of child well-being, in relation to national income per person, there's no relationship, no suggestion of a relationship.
What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing.
The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth.
That's very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.
But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much.
I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.
Here, for instance, is trust.
It's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted.
It comes from the World Values Survey.
You see, at the more unequal end, it's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others.
But in the more equal societies, it rises to 60 or 65 percent.
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital, very similar relationships closely related to inequality.
I may say, we did all this work twice.
We did it first on these rich, developed countries, and then as a separate test bed, we repeated it all on the 50 American states -- asking just the same question: do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures?
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality.
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust.
Same thing is going on.
Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed.
We're not just talking about a fluke.
This is mental illness.
WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year.
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others.
And again, closely related to inequality.
This is violence.
These red dots are American states, and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150.
This is the proportion of the population in prison.
There's a about a tenfold difference there, log scale up the side.
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison.
That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime.
In some places, that's part of it.
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing, harsher sentencing.
And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty.
Here we have children dropping out of high school.
Again, quite big differences.
Extraordinarily damaging, if you're talking about using the talents of the population.
This is social mobility.
It's actually a measure of mobility based on income.
Basically, it's asking: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship between the two?
And at the more unequal end, fathers' income is much more important -- in the U.K., USA.
And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important.
There's more social mobility.
And as we like to say -- and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here -- if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've shown you just a few things in italics here.
I could have shown a number of other problems.
They're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.
Think of the expense, the human cost of that.
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points.
One is that, in graph after graph, we find the countries that do worse, whatever the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality.
It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's most things.
The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that, if you look at the bottom, Sweden and Japan, they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.
The position of women, how closely they keep to the nuclear family, are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world.
But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality.
Sweden has huge differences in earnings, and it narrows the gap through taxation, general welfare state, generous benefits and so on.
Japan is rather different though.
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.
It has lower taxes.
It has a smaller welfare state.
And in our analysis of the American states, we find rather the same contrast.
There are some states that do well through redistribution, some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax.
So we conclude that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality, as long as you get there somehow.
I am not talking about perfect equality, I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.
Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's "No man is an island."
And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy.
This is just one example.
It's infant mortality.
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.
And so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations, so single parents go on their own.
But then where it says "low social class," that's unskilled manual occupations.
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle, then the junior non-manual, going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors, lawyers, directors of larger companies.
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy.
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society.
We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.
And that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.
But I should say a few words about what's going on.
I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality.
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, of being valued and devalued, respected and disrespected.
And of course, those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society.
It also leads to status insecurity.
We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others, whether we're regarded as attractive, clever, all that kind of thing.
The social-evaluative judgments increase, the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.
Interestingly, some parallel work going on in social psychology: some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones, their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.
And in the review, what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol, the central stress hormone.
And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat -- threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance.
Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress.
Now we have been criticized.
Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising.
I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we never pick and choose data.
We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at, it goes into the analysis.
Our data source decides whether it's reliable data, we don't.
Otherwise that would introduce bias.
What about other countries?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals.
This isn't confined to these countries here, hiding a very simple demonstration.
The same countries, the same measure of inequality, one problem after another.
Why don't we control for other factors?
Well we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference.
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on.
What about causality?
Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.
We spend a good bit of time.
And indeed, people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes.
The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system, the cardiovascular system.
Or for instance, the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.
I should say that to deal with this, we've got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things.
We've got to constrain income, the bonus culture incomes at the top.
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can.
I think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us.
Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies, and that's exciting.
Thank you.
(Applause)
