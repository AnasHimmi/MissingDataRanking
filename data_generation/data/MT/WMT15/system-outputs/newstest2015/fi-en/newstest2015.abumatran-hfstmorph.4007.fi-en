Therefore, for Shakespeare gave rise to fear in me.
All of our shortlisted countries in the programme - Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench - said to me: My &quot; kokeile.
Don 't reject the whole idea before I know what they are talking about.
The words tapaile and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 lines Othello 's last speech for documentary and he was sold.
I felt that I can do this.
It was almost as if a part of me would nut intervene earlier, and now it was laid down.
This involves &quot;, this is important, and so do not take it seriously, do your lines, do a little background research.
So the training process was a tough one, and I read the spectacle kaus months before it was carried out.
The drama was ultimately a success.
It evidently expected an onni stuva, but it does not quite hold nyt.
Soon after Henry played a leading role in a comedy of errors.
Suddenly, I played in Britain 's national theatre, and rightly nut can.
At one stage, the idea came to my mind: Oho &quot;, have changed &quot;.
Once again, the spectacle had technical problems, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the public.
&quot; is a small voice in my mind said to me: 'You have to be able to survive &quot; 10 minutes alone, until the computer works again &quot;. &quot;
Instead, the assistant director, said that the move will resume as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I left the scene, and part of me, heaved a sigh of relief.
It is not my duty,
I will leave it to others.
Part &quot; you are going to play a role in keeping &quot;
Henry &quot; Fences &quot; -näytelmässä Duchess-teatterissa
Through the training &quot; Fences &quot; -näytelmään was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes the man 's more durable.
This spectacle was well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; &quot;, this is what you should be doing &quot;.
This KUMEALLA, Henry says, of course, that voice.
So I decided to stick with this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comedian: Small, cocky young humour, our debate was interrupted repeatedly when he exchanged imitaatio to another.
No Stand-up-komiikasta minen is a question of will, for the immediate thanks to an unknown from the general public seems to be dangerous.
If ever it covets, it can lead to an impasse.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time Apollo by cinema, it seems, but in general it will no longer inspire me in the same way as before.
I ask Henry, does he aiko leaving another stand-up-kiertueelle.
It gives me real pleasure to sit together with the guide, which will help to shape the whole country at the beginning of the journey, the middle and the end, and I do not believe that I would never give up on feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I see näyttelemise -
It is really fun.
When play is constantly being told a story, and I feel at ease in this task.
I love stories.
People love the stories.

He was a senior tul lut south with the mobile partner, Kevern presumed to be his aunt. Nyt täti was recovered in the house, which was located in a wet paratiisimaise while in the Valley, and the valley 's name was conveniently Paratiisi Valley.
In the house had not been inhabited nut anyone for years.
The pipeline was leaking, and all bathrooms were hämähäkke, snail nee had left their mark on the windows, the whole place as their own, in the garden, weeds kasvoi, which were huge that I create.

To tell us about the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel &quot; J &quot; is a condition for receiving Booker-kirjallisuuspalkinnon in 2014.
The candidates will be published next week
Kevern was seated nut hand-in-hand with dilapidated Ailinnin, with a long patio chair in the middle of July, enjoying surprising on a warm spring afternoon, listening to both the arrogance vastaanotin, which was heard across the whole country to contain music and reassuring news, when does Ailinnin ristit, solar ruskettama are the feet brought Kevernin recalls a song that was long ago forgotten nut sing esiintyjä black and his father was often heard säle of lut their kaihtime are low.
Football might be too great.
The songs were basically too aggressive, and they no longer been rung in the receiver.
They have not been banned - no actual sti had been banned - they are no longer just been rung.
They wanted to leave unhola, as the actual word unhola.
Public opinion was prompted by what the laws and the declaration had not been achieved: Just as in the field of literature, people chose to read his memoirs heroes, cooking books and romance; music, they prefer ballade.
As the day villiinnyttämä Kevern began to dial an imaginary piano, singing serenadi Ailinnin to big noble to the outrageous comic voice.
Ailinn nyt are not understood.
It was going &quot; pianisti Fats Wallerin famous song &quot;, Kevern told him, and at the same time, by raising two fingers in their mouth.
That his father was always doing nyt before &quot; j &quot; -kirjain eht had to escape his lips.
It was the start of an nut game between him and his father when he was small.
His father said that he played the same game with his own father.
If you did get his j: The word, and you remember nut put two fingers into your mouth, I had to pay a penny themselves.
It was not a very fun game, and it was not so now.
He knew that it was expected of him, that is all.
Her pit did explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of.
There had been no jazzi sti declared itself to be banned, it has not just been rung.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
In life, there was only room for one jos-sanalle.
At the beginning of the song, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
For wiliness nyt, was held in the same way.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the music via nokkeluut.
While Kevern was 10 years of age, have heard of Sammy Davis junior, going lut tul was music to him to know his father through the half CD-kokoelma of salaise.
Well, at least he does not need to tell nut Ailinnille that Fats Waller was black.
Taking huomioon Ailinnin iän said it was likely that he did not remember nut era when popular singers were not black.
Again, not having been lake or coercion.
A simple society meant that each of its parts approved ina gratitude - gratitude ina, that they were as good at the commercial nee are spared - to the principle according to which each group made it a natural thing.
His temperament wins out and their physical characteristics based on African karibi are sexual juure by their own people are best suited to entertaining reason urheile and the country, and so they sang and ran out.
Initially, India from the continent were as natural to a talented with electronic equipment, so their job was to ensure that every family had a telephone, which was used for things.
Those who were left in the Polish community, were working as plumbers; the last Greeks were broken plates.
When SE, happened MITÄ, JOS took place, it was proven that they were from the Gulf and hail Lähi-Idästä, whose grandparents were not pelo paen nee are swiftly so that they would be accused of flames roihahtamise, for fear that they would reach the flames next to them, opened up restaurants that served labneh-jogurttia and burned water smokestack, and continued with their lives in their country created ina and depressed tylsyyte of ina.
Everyone must act according to their talents.
Ailinn was heard only ballade, and he said it was difficult to understand how Kevernin just sing the offensive words had never been puke can be music.
Through music, expressing love.
They are not actually &quot; are insulting &quot;, Kevern said.
Except, perhaps, that big cephalopods.
My own father never loukan nut anybody, but this song made him happy.
He was already nut said too much, but were rejected for Banks created an illusion of security.
Not a single word is circulating among a huge supply of crops through the soundproofing of newspapers.
Ailinn nyt are not yet understood.
Why did your father he did something like that?
He aiko was trying to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but it does not want nut to raise two fingers to his lips Ailinnin club.
Ailinn pit told him strange now.
The father &quot; thought it was amusing &quot; &quot;, he said instead.
Ailinn pudist was its head in disbelief, and she covered her hair Kevernin points.
There is nothing to be seen in the whole world than Ailinnin enormous varikse, with hair pehko.
Anything he does not want to see nut.
Once &quot; if &quot; by saying so, he said, but it does not sound nut convinced.
It does not, however, explain why they sing it to me.
Ailinn seemed to be genuinely baffled.
My feet are so big?
He looked again.
Did you get your foot in the actual sti are not large.
Ankle could, perhaps, a little bit...
And you hate me because my foot is too thick?
I hate you?
Of course, I hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He would have been able to say nut &quot; &quot; I love you, but it was still too early for that.
For me, the charming &quot; are thick because of your ankles &quot;, he tried to remedy the situation.
I have a perverse sense.
This did not help.
He had to ask nut it sounds nice.
Often, when he wanted hauskuutta, the effect was quite different because he, like his father, was lacking in a convincing charmi where vits brutality can control.
Perhaps his father was mean nut to be cruel.
Perhaps he, Kevern, wanted the same.
Indulgent, in spite of his eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was blush with patio and rose from his wheelchair and tipped at the same time, the receiver and wine läikytt said that they were just nee by drink.
The wine was only selja ty put on flowers, and so he does nut can use the reason törmäily.
In his nervousness, he seemed tärisevä, like palm trees in the storm.
The Fat &quot; and you got is what appeals to you in shouldering &quot;, he said...
Except that does not seem to me.
Kevern was sorry Ailinnin, as well as their own, is unnecessarily cruel because they say that because of its pelo, which was reflected in the eyes of this moment when Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Ailinn any thought that she would beat me?
He had never told nut Kevernille during a life of dealing in the north of the island, where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it was essentially the same as life here too.
The same enormous hyinen sea, who aaltoil went against them.
The same confused men, albeit after the event pirullisemma still kalpeamma and the great sala kuljettaja-, which their vanhempa, moved from pub to pub, appearing ready to long-standing every woman who would dare to oppose kiusoitell or to them.
Thick head?
Yet she would see a thick nyrki, if not be careful!
Imuta force.' - pussaamise had tul lut routine.' of a man and a woman 's erotic encounter a telling word; a receiver out of the orders placed by extraction of meaningless ballad love imuta are an antidote - first and attack.
The latter Kevernin thought that was too much, because it was already imuttaminen itself hostile.
Ailinn Solomonsin body language called him to leave for good reason.
He pulled himself up on the patio chair rather than an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of the sorrow Kevernin has surprised him.
No, this was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn resulted in her spending - just as he watched his travelling companion Kevernin entering the upper floors from the window - a man who was personally responsible for heavy life.
On leaving the garden aatami, he thought.
He 's an hour Keverniä sense of pity and towards men in general, even though some of them were nut put his hands against him in order to attack.
Backs turned nyt - kumarainen, shame vä, being beaten, a man who had lost all desire to fight - and why he felt that it was so familiar to him, even though he does not remember nut that had never previously before this moment we saw nyt drill?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A couple of years before I have just described what happened to the intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in measuring public opinion in private institutions Ofnowissa, made a brief inquiry into small and medium-sized kova valla continued violence in the country, in those areas where the reduction in violent valla, or even end, was most likely taking huomioon Nice.' rooting out of money and energy.
Getting &quot; much has already been achieved, and much remains to be done, without reason &quot;, he wrote, in order to offset &quot; thousands of years I fought and won most of the nation 's natural aggression, particularly those abandoned and isolated kolk options.', where over hedgerows, despite church towers may lempeyt people aiko are rarely known over time.
Some issues, however, does not go away entirely.
The higher the Tower, the lower it is, the reason the kicks.
The nation is crying ballad of sentimentaalis, was the age of bytes adversity telling stories and is married and family life by virtue of its name, but at the same time, the old tripartite cruelty must be unrelenting in its grip in both rural communities and subject to common residential areas, and there is evidence of a new, on the goodwill pahasieluisemmasta row kode, in the workplace, on our streets and even in parks.
There is an unfortunate tendency &quot; you dramatise &quot;, its director, commented on her to read the whole report.
I would like to suggest that you read less romaane.
Nussbaum was putting his eyes on the country.
In addition, I have to ask: Are you an atheist?
I believe &quot;, there is no need for me to answer this &quot;, Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you lesbo?
Putting was still right to be responding to a world without personal questions.
A feminist?
Once again, silence.
I do not ask &quot; &quot;, Luther Rabinowitz said, "since I oppose &quot; ateismi, lesbian seksuaalisuut and feminism.
In this workplace, it perpetuates prejudices.
We are open-minded society 's servants.
Although a certain degree of sensitivity in itself is perfectly acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what has just been said to me.
Obviously, you have something against the church - and what you have described as cruel or evil thinking, others tend to appoint as a natural energy and physical strength ".
There was talk minen of MITÄ, JOS happened, as if it were happening nut yesterday, if it happened at all, would destroy the country 's fundamental vitality.
Putting Rabinowitzin Nussbaum felt around while talking.
Behind the main flamingo cocky Rabinowitzin vaalean instruction through LED light declared that Ofnow jaka nut had been in the country during the last quarter of the century, or longer.
There were neighbours, appreciate your partner, listening ballade, is conducting musikaale, do not use your telephone, discuss, explain, listen, does not agree, asking for an apology.
Talking is better than silence and raised the word is better than it has been written, but nothing will love.
&quot;, I understand very well what I have to say &quot;, Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice when it was certain that his driver had finished, only &quot; and I would like to say that we are not equally effective cure than we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we were not warned, we see samo, we repeat the mistakes which originally led MITÄ happened, JOS took place.
This time we vuodata, our anger and our confidence in each other.
Luther Rabinowitz formed with his fingers in the pyramid.
This gesture meant endless patience.
&quot; &quot; goes too far, he said, would describe &quot; &quot; error &quot; those acts which our grandparents are likely nee to do or not to do, without good reason.
They also go too far in saying that they were crying &quot; in their hatred and mistrust of their other &quot; &quot;.
When would you like to be in a position, should not have to remind the world that, when it comes to the understanding of the past, or present, we are not talking &quot; &quot; of &quot; &quot;, or about them.
There was no &quot; &quot; us &quot; &quot; and others.
It was a time of chaos, and that is all we know about it.
&quot;, if we are quite honest, it was in chaos &quot;, Esme dared go to countries, no society &quot; 's group cannot say he behaved very well.
I am not accusing anyone.
What was done, was done, whether it was good or bad.
It was at that time.
There is no need to speak any more - and here we agree with.
And just as it is unnecessary to distribute accusations, nor does it need to make corrections, whether justified or not, and even if there were some way to make them.
But what for the past is there, then, if it does not take the lessons...
The past is there, so we can forget it.
If I may add one thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
Your report &quot; run through &quot;, he said, and indicated that it was time to leave Esmen.
The next day, he went to work in a normal way, he hit the pavement driving va motorcyclist, whose driving &quot; by passers-by who were described as evil and furious &quot; bid.
Accident occurs.

Four vinkki to be superior to the underwater pictures and videos
If you want to take pictures or video under water, you have your choice of several different equipment options.
The low-cost option is water resistant, then kompakti point-and-shoot-kamera, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 action-kamera, or, like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver editio, who both were paid around 300 dollars.
Personally, I took these pictures at a family party, using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are certain rules that should be adhered to.
Always check your device twice over.
If you had the camera was watertight, do not guarantee, however, that the camera akku and other sections have been closed water pitävästi.
In addition to setting the camera 's description Regulation to countries respond to images or video.
Some cameras or cameras and video cameras in the combination of a regulation, which helps to optimise crew conditions under water.
In addition, before we jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can bring.
Some of the cameras only 5 feet depth, some 50-60 feet depth.
Agenda for both ordinary and watertight malle points to our purchase guide digikamero and the criticism.
Take several pictures were mone of them - have failed in some way.
The cameras kompakte has lcd-näyttö, which enables sommitell can image, whereas action-kameroissa often do not have this quality.
If you have an LCD, it is difficult to see under water, and the image sommittelu can either succeed or fail.
So take lots of pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows haarukoinni, which means many of the images taken at different regulations, not taking advantage of this quality.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is falling significantly deeper.
If possible, stop at or near the surface would describe it as in the pool, lake or ocean.
Thus, the pictures could also get more colours; the deeper you go, the less visible colours.
Try to get close to the subject matter to be portrayed.
This is an important piece of advice when we describe in this country, but even more important under water because of light conditions are scarce.
It is very important, when there is an action-kamera: These devices are often fixed linssi, which has a broad picture, namely the cameraman should be close to the site, so that an object meets the frameworks of the whole picture.

Perspective sus of ulvonta (even): The growth of the fan numbers, how can you explain it?
Fiilis today was quite amazing.
This was Sakari Pehkonen basket world stature in 1995, when Finland had pelan nut EM-loppu in the tournament against France Maroussin palloilu hall in Athens.
No Pehkonen are exaggerated.
I remember the game when it was there.
It was also about 100 Finnish who shouted 20 000 spectators to pull, otherwise empty, to manage the uproar.
I wonder what would be said Pehkonen nut 19 years later in the World Cup after the Ukraine match Finland?
In Bilbao, hundreds of Finnish fans eight troops are 50 times.
The European Championships of 1995 was the game of the Finnish etsikko era.
These men were searching their way to the win by countries including Russia, muun selection match in Helsinki in the sports department.
This victory ove opened the cream.
Everything seemed good.
It was a promising young people, such as Hanno Möttölä.
The main managers Henrik Dettmann Möttölä went through the chalk for the club championships are at the end.
The solution, which many people had a different view.

This phenomenon has grown to such proportions.
No one will know the exact figure Finnish Games tourists.
The estimates are moving between nee 500-10 000 7.
Whatever the figure was that sometimes, it is quite incomprehensible.
This is sports sosiologe for an explanation.
In a globalised world economy, companies are moving across borders.
In sport, there is still an opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
The increase in mobility, we will have to see how our girls and our son in the business world, says sports sosiologia 's professor Hannu Itkonen.
Certainly, both in Spain and in the air of the World Cup in Poland is the Finns who elämys were looking for.
A common experience.
It still does not explain everything.
In fact, sport must become more attractive.
Itkonen brings the sport into the popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to start sports Games than to Berlin to see art.
Without success in the masses still does not move.
Just look back to 1995.
Then the managers Dettmann challenged basketball league and players to indulge his long-standing elite in a professional manner.
For almost ten years it took.
Then the tide turned and the team activity was paramount.
These air Earth saman did move a bit earlier.

As Itkonen says, both species have managed to land their elite products, in which the holy triad operates: Sports media sponsori are.
It will also take an interest in the public.
And the media has taught nut, what kind of support it karnevalistinen, Itkonen recalls.
Whether palloilu species are transferred to a long-standing interest in this massive sarjo also killing?

A smart way to save in textbooks
The cost of university documents mone were Amerika are exceeded in the case of USD 1 000 students, so soon after the second year of study establishing the Matt Schroeder came up with clever tavan to save costs.
He has developed a system in which subsequent annual rates were students who borrow their books against nominal compensation instead that they would sell the books - with the saman route.
My &quot; mathematics book nut would normally cost $180; I paid it for use throughout the academic year to 10 dollars and a hefty sandwich &quot; says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying in the Covenant College in the State of Georgia.
Schroeder says that in his last academic term, his book would normally pay nee from $430.
Instead, he used them to $120.
The Executive Board of the universities, the average student spends more than 1 200 dollars per year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have at their disposal a number of ways of reducing these costs.
The students were increasingly getting used to long-standing Schroederin online shops, an idea of the kind of creative approaches.
More and more students to rent textbooks, which they can use to book the entire academic period and pay were considerably less than the book was bought by students.
More than 250 campus book trade, according to the ex-rebels Neebo inc -yrityksen rent textbooks nut, has doubled since 2011.
The statistical data reveal that approximately a quarter of university bookshops books last spring was temporary documents Neebo-yrityksen chairman Trevor Meyer says.
The National Association of College Stores -kauppajärjestön says that less than half of all books purchased in the campus book stores.
This is the simplest way to save real money.
The online trade
Online shops in the new book saad can only one third of the price of what it would cost kampukse in the book trade.
Ron Larsoni, Bruce Edwardsi and Robert Calculus Hostetlerin &quot; &quot; -kirjan during the 9th edition of Recommendation price is almost $290, but special documents on-line Chegg.com, the book will cost 239,99 dollars.
Buy used
The books are a good option, if the reader do not interfere with other notes and passed the appearance.
For example &quot; Calculus &quot; -kirjan gets used Chegg.com-verkkokaupasta 93,49 dollars.
Brigham Young Universityn last year 's student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says he bought the book &quot; Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business &quot; used Amazon.com net trade only 0.42 dollars.
As a new book nut would cost $48.
The University of Massachusetts Amherst &apos; 's College Without Walls -koulun director Ingrid Bracey and other academics would recommend that students ask professors to whether previous versions used in the course.
Sometimes, the new edition of the reforms are not essential for education.
In this case, the old edition can be found only a fraction of the price, which should pay for the new.
Amazon Chegg- and book shops, eBay 's Half.com inc &apos;, is popular with the purchase of books.
Rental
Rental of textbooks is worth considering if you consider them good care, I can remember back to them and you do not need them, of course, be completed.
Rent in the world can save more than 80% of the cost of the new book.
For example, Calculus &quot; &quot; -kirjan rental for the entire academic year at a cost of about 20 dollars.
Agenda of the hire company 's rules, such as notes, the criticisms raised perhaps use and wear and tear on subsequent payments.
Vuokraaja, not your guard: If you forget to bring a book, late payment cannot be greater than the purchase price of the books.
Their e-kirja
Acquiring e-kirjo vehicles instead of ordinary paper tull can also be a question.
Sometimes, these books are hired, paid e-kirja, of the holder, for example, Amazon.com-, inc Chegg- or Barnes &amp; Noble -kirjakaupoille.
No Chegg-kaupasta &quot; Calculus &quot; -kirjan e-kirja during the six months by approximately $61.
According to Braceyn mone by literature students are saving the most, because a number of quote from ladat can now free of charge, while science and technology books can be very kalli.
A comparison of the various sellers, which option then chooses.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon begin Pepperdinen Faculty, recommends a good reason to use a price book ISBN-numero out because it will be able to ensure that proper records were sought.
Before the web site, to ensure that this book is certainly in storage, Gault says.

He bought his home delivery of the paper was on the ice for four weeks, and he was eventually forced to land purchase the book at full price, the university bookshop.

Putin calls on Kiev to open land uut government negotiations with the eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted on Sunday that Ukraine 's government to stop the fight against separatists in the east of the country, and to immediately start negotiations with the region of outgoing &quot; valtiomaisuudesta &quot;, Russian news sources are telling.
His representative Dmitry Peskov, clarified later that Putin will mean nut that separatist forces control the country from the eastern Ukrainian region tul part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine should think again so that we can give to the Russian-speaking population of the region 's power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin 's government in Kiev to give mä insistence on negotiations with the rebels, Russian equal ina negotiating partners will respond to her obvious strategy, which he follows nut since the violence began five years ago: He is trying to help the country to separatists to power with countries of the region and thus forcing countries to grant the Government of Ukraine, in practice, to long-standing Novorossijalle to newly proclaimed independence, enabling it to turn to Russia instead of the West.
The State Kanava -tv-kanavan 1 interview Putin condemned the Ukrainian army 's efforts to take back the separatist ma full control of the Eastern Luhanski of Donetski and the region that the separatists stormed huhti in March and Moscow annexed Ukraine 's Crimea peninsula itself on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently baptises &quot; of nee region Novorossijaksi &quot;, for a new Russian &quot; &quot; - this term to remind the Russian major valla revolutions of the previous glory days.
The Russian news agency Itar-Tassi, Putin said that the planned peace talks are an illusion &quot; &quot; as long as Ukrainian politicians 'campaigns were carried out on 26 October to the parliamentary elections and the government' s jouko are attacking the separatists in the regions controlled by civilians.
We have commenced &quot; va immediately after extensive negotiations, not just technical seiko, but also the organisation of society and the State of south-eastern Ukraine status; it takes huomioon people living there &quot; interests, he says.
According to Mr Putin 's reference Peskovin &quot; valtiomaisuudesta &quot; are associated with greater independence, which has been discussed for months kaus with Kiev 's leadership as it tries to dispel the Russian-speaking regions 'fears that their cultural and linguistic rights would be endangered ina.
Only the government of Ukraine can be granted to the eastern regions of a country 's independence, Peskov says.
This matter is not void to hold talks between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, then &quot; because it is not the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but Ukraine 's internal conflict &quot;.
Heckling by a representative of the Kremlin, whose aim was to put Mr Putin 's comments &quot; an erroneous interpretation &quot;, pointed out that the Russian administration will deal with the eastern regions 'separatist rebellion in a different way than in the Crimea, where it was virtually occupied a territory whose 2 million population is ethnic Russian majority.
Moscow would be much more difficult to link itself even Luhanski Donetski or the region in eastern Ukraine, because most of the territory of 6.5 million people is not ethnically Russian and because of prior to the conflict, according to opinion polls, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
Independence, which Russian diplomats already lee are discussed in international forums, would allow Ukraine to local governments the right to set their own trade deals and foreign relations, which would give the Kremlin virtually power in a region that links Russia with Crimea.

The Russian Rostovin between Crimea and the region also has mines, factories and metal sulattamo growers who produce the Russian army vital products.

His vision for independence, however, there appears to be a sharp difference between the Kremlin and Moscow 's armed and stirring up the separatist view.
Putin made his latest call for the government in Kiev for talks with the Russian rebels ina equal partners since the rebels went further last week by Russian tanks and troops to eastern Ukraine invasion of a previously peaceful region Azovi off the coast of the sea.
Ukraine 's security authorities were afraid that Russia sponsored separatists Novoazovskin to take possession of the city is the beginning of a larger effort, the purpose of which is to take over the strategically important coastal area up to Crimea.
It has led to massive nut civilians and military personnel in the country to reinforce Mariupoli city of half a million inhabitants of the Mariupol steel known as productive as a port city, which is located on the Crimea Peninsula Novoazovskin and a leading niche between the land.
On Saturday, Poroshenko was speaking in Brussels as European Union leaders ano, with additional measures to prevent attacks from Russia in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic valla, which has been independent for 23 years.
