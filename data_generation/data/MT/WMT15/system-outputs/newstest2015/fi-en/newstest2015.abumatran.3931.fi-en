After receiving Othellona kriitikoilta much good feedback on the role he is immersed in the making of the theatre.
The next item was a comedy series and fences, August Wilson ("Fences").
The conclusion of the theatre, offers a different experience than sitcomit and komediat, which Henry has done throughout the busy careers.
Henry started only 16 when he was in the area of a factory worker.
At one stage, he saw a DJ doing imitaatioita and contacted -kykykilpailuun New Faces.
In the middle of the 1970s Henryn tv-ura began. "For quite a long time I was TV 's only black imitaattori and the comedian", he says.
The work of Henry learned in doing so.
I had to grow up in the spotlight, I had to learn how to produce jokes a few years 1975-1985, while at the same time the body tähteyttä and I was on television. It was a difficult time.
Lenny -kykykilpailussa New Faces in 1975
Henryn managerilla had näyttämöoikeudet The Black and White Minstrel Show 'hun, light-touch viihdeohjelmaan, where people appeared mustaihoisiksi meikattuina, so Henry koomikoksi went on the programme for a period of five years.
My family did not like that.
On the other hand, I would hope that I would ever be involved in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was a bizarre and objectionable, I got to do some work on a massive events, and I learned how to deal with the public.
Still, "britti-tv 's rewarded, multiannual viihdeohjelma favourite and light at the same time" was a "grotesque parody blacks of people".
Henry worked in the 80s in the second komediasarjassa, which both made fun of that - black British culture being under.
In The Lenny Henry Show, the first episode was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s, for example, was once known as the Henry hahmostaan chef Gareth Blacklockina komediasarjassa Chef!
It is the next decade of Henry observed advertisements, the dokumenttien, with tv-sarjojen and elokuvaosien, but the BBC in 2008 after he undertook LennyHenry.tv-sarjansa said to themselves: 'What are you going to move on to the next, Len - it now seems that only poljet paikallasi kuljet or processes ".
The next item was Radio 4 Abandoned dokumenttisarja 'What 's So Great About...? ".
The first part was devoted to Shakespeare.
I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It has not really been taught to us in school properly, and I think it was the white middle class, which uses sukkahousuja, and who has the money.
Therefore Shakespeare-aihe gave me the fear.
All persons in the programme haastattelemamme - Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench - said to me: "To investigate.
Don 't reject the whole idea before you know what you did.
The words tapaile and ymmärrät, why do we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry Othellon said 20 lines of the last speech for the documentary, and he had been sold.
I knew that I will be able to do this.
It seemed almost as if a part of me had been missing before, and now it is marginalised.
'This is what it is all about, this is important, and so do not take it seriously, do our säkeesi, doing little taustatutkimusta.
It was, therefore, a tough Harjoitteluprosessi, and I read the scene for months before it was carried out.
This show was ultimately a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but that is exactly what has happened.
Soon after that, Henry komediassa errors played a leading role.
The British suddenly näyttelin kansallisteatterissa and I really could not believe it to be true.
At one point I was thinking of the idea: "Oho, you have changed".
Again, the play had technical problems, and Henry knew clearly that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A small voice in my mind said to me:" You have to be able to survive alone for 10 minutes, until the computer works again "".
Instead, an assistant director, announced that the motion will resume as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked out of the scene, and part of me huokaisi a sigh of relief.
It is not my responsibility,
I can leave it in the hands of others.
"You are part of the spectacle, hold roolissasi '
Henry -näytelmässä Duchess-teatterissa 'Fences'
Training vuorosanojen -näytelmään "Fences" was a challenge.
Panic is a good thing, it makes the man 's more sustainable.
This, too, this show was well received, so it was as if a sign jumalilta; 'This is what you have to do ".
This, of course, Henry tells KUMEALLA voice.
So, I decided to stick to this.
I love most sincerely for this work.
I love harjoitteluhuoneita.
Henry is, however, still essentially a comedian: Small huumorinpoikaset continued to interrupt our conversation when changing her imitaatiosta to another.
Abstinence Stand-up-komiikasta has tahdonkysymys, because getting immediate praise tuntemattomalta from the public seems dangerous.
If it is constantly janoat, this can lead to an impasse.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time Apollo-teatterilla, when it appears, but in general it will no longer inspire me in the same way as before.
I ask Henryltä, whether he or she will no longer have to go for another stand-up-kiertueelle.
It gives me real pleasure to sit together with the director, which will help to shape the whole journey of initial, mid-term and at the end, and I do not believe that I would never give up the feeling.
This, then, is his novel jälleensyntymisensä?
I think so.
I consider näyttelemisestä -
It is really fun.
Constantly Näytellessä told the story, and in that role I enjoy.
I love stories.
People love stories.

A high level 's promoter Berkeleyn founder and chairman Tony Pidgley said on Monday that "the current talousvuoden, from the outset, the number of markets and shops have returned normal after the 2013 piikin" and added that this has made it possible to achieve a "stable environment".

Only we Jacobsonin Howard 's grip on the praise for the contribution of the new novel, which tells of love and j-kirjaimesta
They liukenivat, it is best described as what has been happening, gradually they irtosivat each other than pahvilaatikko has been left out of the rainfall.
Only then, he heard a woman, that it was too serious, arduous, intensive, disengagement, and perhaps also a little piikikäs.
Then he heilautti put it.
He identified piikikkään.
Yes, he had piikikäs, than siili.
Her piikkiensä was the most recent victim was in the early stages of a relationship, which had, however, been a promising; had seemed that this relationship would have been able to make it easier for his lonely tylsyyttään, and it would perhaps have been able to bring to his life even as something of substance.
Ailinn Solomonsilla had kesyttämättömät hair and he was at the heart of the delicate hentoinen kaunotar iloluontoisella, a northern village, which was even more prosaic and away from everything as Port Reuben.
He had come to the South with the older matkakumppanin, which had expected to be his Kevern tätinsä. Täti had inherited a house, which was situated paratiisimaisessa kosteassa but in the valley, and the name of the valley was conveniently Paratiisilaakso.
No one in the house has not been lived in for years.
Pipes vuotivat, in all kylpyhuoneissa had hämähäkkejä, then etanat had left their mark on windows, the whole place as their own, the garden grew from weeds, who reminded the gigantic kaalinpäitä.
At all mökki had as children, while at the same time, threatening and magical, puutarha full of secrets.
Writer said: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" has provided over Booker-kirjallisuuspalkinnon in 2014.
Ehdokkuudet is published next week
Kevern Ailinnin had sat hand in hand with a long rikkinäisillä terassituolilla Hay should in the middle, enjoying surprisingly warm keväisestä in the afternoon, both listening to a receiver costing hajamielisesti, via which the whole country has heard tyynnyttävää music and reassuring news, whereas Ailinnin ristityt, solar ruskettamat feet brought Kevernin reminiscent of a song, which was a black laulanut long ago forgotten esiintyjä, which his father had often listened mökin sälekaihtimet low.
Jalkasi is too great.
Such mighty songs were, in principle, too aggressive, and they played no longer vastaanottimessa.
They have not been banned - nothing has actually been banned - they are no longer just played.
They wanted to leave to oblivion, such as myself, the word unholakin.
Public opinion has achieved what the laws and put julistamisella has not been achieved: Just as in the field of literature, people chose from heroes muistelmia, of keittokirjoja and romansseja, music, they prefer balladeja.
Kevern villiinnyttämänä today began to dial a fictitious pianoa and sing the arrogant serenadia Ailinnin big legs koomisella voice.
Ailinn is not understood.
"It was Fats jazzpianisti Wallerin a famous song", Kevern told him and raised at the same time, by its very nature, the two finger at its mouth.
That is how his father had always done, before 'j' slip she -kirjain went on.
It began as a fight between her and the father when he was small.
His father pelanneensa told the same game with his own father.
If päästit suustasi j: The beginning of the word, and you are remembering to express two finger at the front, the jouduit to pay a penny.
It was not very nice at the time of the game, and it was not one now.
He knew that it was expected of him, that is all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of something like that.
The banned Jazziakaan had not actually been declared, it has just been played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
In life there was only room for one jos-sanalle.
At the start of a song, people wanted to know exactly where it would come to an end.
Nokkeluudelle had been in the same way.
Its unpredictability brought people on edge.
And jazz was the music that expressed via nokkeluutta.
Although Kevern has not been heard from 10 years of age, by Sammy Davis junioria, then jazz-musiikki had become familiar with him through his father puolisalaisen CD-kokoelman.
Well, at least he did not have to tell Ailinnille that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailinnin age was likely, that he remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Here too, therefore, did not require laws rather than coercion.
Obedience society meant that each of its parts, accepted with gratitude - the gratitude, for the fact that they were saved from trade than happiness - the principle according to which each group made it the natural elements.
On the basis of their characteristics temperamenttinsa and physical afro-karibialaiset sukujuuret histories are best viihdyttämään and into sport, so they, and ran for it.
Initially, India were coming from the continent as inherently talented with electrical equipment and, therefore, their task was to ensure that every family had a telephone, which was used to deal with matters.
Those who were left of the Polish community, worked putkimiehinä; Greeks broke the last lautasia.
When the SE, then MITÄ happened, JOS happened came true, they were Persianlahdesta and hail Lähi-Idästä, whose grandparents were not swiftly fled for fear of being charged with flames roihahtamisesta and the fear that those flames reach the next to them, have opened restaurants, where I saw labneh-jogurttia and burned vesipiippua, and prolonged the lives and eyes of the country luotuina tylsyyteen masentuneina.
Let each and every one, according to lahjojensa.
Ailinn was heard only balladeja, and he was difficult to understand how Kevernin just laulamat offensive words had never been musiikiksi to dress.
The love expressed through music.
"No, they are not really insulting", Kevern said.
Except perhaps isojalkaisten thinks.
My father never offended anyone, but this song got him.
He had already said too much, but rejected puutarha created an illusion of security.
Not a single word of levies be passed through a giant kaalinpääkasvien newspaper äänieristyksen.
Ailinn is not yet understood.
Why should father loved something like that?
He intended to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but did not want to raise the finger at two company huulilleen Ailinnin.
Ailinn gave him strange right now.
"It was a father 's people laugh", he said instead.
Ailinn pudisti its head in disbelief, and he covered his hair Kevernin terms.
Nothing else to see here in the whole world than Ailinnin huge variksenmusta hiuspehko.
Nothing more than that he did not want to see.
"If you say so", he said, but not did vakuuttuneelta.
It does not, however, explain why tune it to me.
Ailinn seemed to be genuinely baffled.
Whether or not my foot so big?
She looked again.
Are you really jalkasi are not large.
Nilkkasi, perhaps, a little bit...
And you vihaat me because nilkkani are too fat?
I hate you?
Of course, I hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He would have been able to say 'banner you', but it was still too early for that.
"You are, I think, because of the charming paksujen nilkkojesi", he tried to remedy the situation.
I have a perverse sense.
This was not helpful.
He had wanted it sounded nice.
Often, when he wanted hauskuuttaa, the effect was quite different, because for him, as for her isältäänkin, was missing from the convincing charmi, where vitsien cruelty can control.
Perhaps his father was meant to be cruel.
Perhaps he, Kevern, wanted the same.
Despite lempeistä sight.
Ailinn Solomons terassituoliltaan punastui and went up and down at the same time läikytti and a receiver of wine, which they just were drunk.
Only viinikin had been seljankukista, and so he could not have used törmäilyn, is the cause.
Hermostuneisuudessaan, he seemed tärisevän, than palmupuun press storm.
"And you have got into the thick of it, what consequences sinussa appeals to me", he said....
Not only does it seem to me.
Kevern was unhappy Ailinnin, as well as their own, unnecessarily cruel because of the words that, because of its fear, which was reflected in the eyes of this at a time when Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Ailinn Luuliko that he would?
She had never told Kevernille life hyisessä northern archipelago, where he had grown up, but the Kevern was sure that, in essence, it had been the same as life here too.
The same huge hyinen sea, who aaltoili against them.
The same mixed feelings about men, albeit after what has happened, yet kalpeammat and pirullisemmat than salakuljettaja- and hajottajaisovanhempansa - vaelsivat pubista pubiin, ready to kill each and every woman who would dare to oppose kiusoitella or to them.
Thick head?
Yet he could see a thick nyrkin, unless, of course, be careful!
First - Imuta pussaamisesta had become the most common cause of a man and a woman 's erotic encounter a telling word; a receiver out of the orders placed by extraction imuta petty rakkausballadien antidote - at first, and then attacked.
Kevernin is of the view that even that was too much, because the already imuttaminen itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomonsin kehonkieli urged him to leave.
He withdrew himself terassituolista up like an old man.
Ailinn uupuneeksi also felt, but the depth of grief Kevernin has surprised him.
No, this was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed his move on - just as her matkakumppaninsa watched the rigid Kevernin yläkerran window - a man who was himself responsible for the heavy lives.
Departing aatami puutarhasta, he wondered.
He did an hour towards säälintunnetta Keverniä and men in general, even if some of them had raised their hands against him iskeäkseen.
Their back turned, then kumarainen, of häpeävä, a beaten man, which had disappeared from all starts - why he felt that that was a sight so familiar to him, even though he failed, that would have never previously seen that, before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was once again alone, he felt that the legs.
A few years before an event that has just been outlined in an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked for the opinion of Yleistä mittaavassa Ofnowissa private institutions, did a short study on the continuation of the violence to low keskikovan and the country 's regions, where violence reduction, or even an end, was likely, given its eradication spent money and energy.
"A lot has already been achieved, and much remains to be done", he wrote, "in order to be able to compensate for thousands of years, and in most cases has won the nation 's natural aggression, particularly in those rejected and remote corners of the globe, where the felling of hedgerows over paedophile kirkontorneista despite ihmislempeyttä has historically rarely known.
Some things, however, will not be lifted completely.
The higher the Tower, the lower are the whim.
The nation cries sentimentaalisten balladien, see ahmii voitetuista hardship stories and will be married and family life should name, but at the same time, an unreconstructed atrocity hellittämättömässä maintains the grip that both maalaisyhteisöjä kaupunkimaisia yhteisasuinalueita, and, in addition, there is evidence of a new form of, then pahasieluisemmasta riitelyntahdosta in their homes, at work, on our streets and even leikkipuistoissa.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to over-dramatize", her ohjaajansa commented on his reading of the entire report.
I would suggest that luet less of the Roma.
ESME Nussbaum fell by looking to the country.
In addition, I have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I believe there is no need for me to answer that", Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you are a lesbian?
ESME still appealed to the right not to answer personal questions.
A feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I am not going to ask", Luther Rabinowitz said, "since I oppose ateismia, of lesboseksuaalisuutta and feminismiä.
This bias in the workplace is not maintained.
We are the servants of a fair-minded society.
Although a certain yliherkkyys in itself is perfectly acceptable and praiseworthy, it can sometimes lead to perverse results, such as, what exactly esitit to me.
You obviously have something against the church - and what you invitations julmuudeksi, or pahasieluisuudeksi, others call usually voimakkuudeksi luontaiseksi energisyydeksi and fyysiseksi.
It hokeminen MITÄ happened, JOS happened, as if it had happened yesterday, if it happened at all, is destroying the country 's fundamental dynamics.
ESME Nussbaum felt around Rabinowitzin spoke.
Behind Rabinowitzin flamingonvaaleanpunainen LED light heads declared the formula, which the Ofnow had divided the country already has a quarter of the previous century, or longer.
No naapurillesi, value kumppaniasi, listening balladeja, becomes musikaaleissa, using puhelintasi, discuss, explain, listen, not agree, asking for forgiveness.
Talking is better than silence and have the word is better than it was written, but there is nothing to win the love.
"I can understand very well what you want to say", Esme Nussbaum replied in a subdued voice, when it was certain that her ohjaajansa had finished, "and I would just like to say that we are not as efficient as it becomes as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we do not label, we see the same mistakes toistavamme, which originally led MITÄ happened, JOS took place.
This time, however, we do not intend vihaamme and our contempt for others.
Luther Rabinowitz sormillaan formed the pyramid.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far", he said, "kuvaillessasi" a mistake "for those acts, which the grandparents might have to do or not to do.

Four vinkkiä better vedenalaisiin images and videos
If you want to take pictures or video under water, you have several different valittavanasi laitevaihtoehtoja.
The cheapest option is an vedenkestävä - kompakti point-and-shoot-kamera, as in the case of the Nikon Coolpix AW120 action-kamera, or, as in the case of the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, which both cost about 300 dollars.
Personally, I took these pictures perhejuhlassa, using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
There are a few of the equipment, regardless of the rules, which deserve to be respected.
Check laitteesi always twice.
If you were a watertight camera, make sure, however, that the camera akku and other parts have been closed to seal off.
In addition to calling kuvausasetukset camera appearing to respond to the images or video.
In certain kameroissa or camera yhdistelmissä videokameran and a regulation that improves kuvausolosuhteet under water.
In addition - before you boarded the water, make sure how deep laitteesi can take.
Some of the cameras will take only 5 feet depth, others even in the depth of 50 to 60 feet.
That, both on ordinary tutustu vedenpitäviin models osto-oppaassamme and digikameroiden arvosteluissa.
Take a series of images - many of them fail in some way.
Kompakteissa kameroissa has lcd-näyttö, which can sommitella image, whereas action-kameroissa often do not have this quality.
Although you might be in LCD, it is difficult to see under water, and the image sommittelu can either succeed or fail.
So, take a series of images.
If, in addition, allows kamerasi haarukoinnin, which means the inclusion of several images at once in different regulations, not taking advantage of this quality.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is falling significantly deeper.
If possible, stop at the surface of the near kuvatessasi uima-altaassa, a lake or in the ocean.
So you get kuviisi also more colours; the deeper you go, the less the colours can be seen.
Trying to get close to the site kuvattavaa.
This is an important piece of advice on land kuvattaessa, but even more so under water, because valo-olosuhteet are scarce.
It is very important, when we have an action-kamera: These devices often have a fixed linssi, which has a large kuvakulma, in other words, the cameraman must be close to the site, in order to meet the target for the whole picture of the frameworks.
China will not allow Hong Kong to elect their leaders - and the protesters swear revenge
China 's parliament decided on Sunday that Hong Kong 's voters are allowed to choose their candidates for the 2017 elections growing, democratic reform, despite the exacting rauhattomuudesta.
The decision is likely to spark of Hong Kong 's business district long odotetuille protesteille activists have begun to plan and implement protests just hours after the publication of the decision.
The decision of the Chinese National People 's Congress will, in practice, the power of the Communists to stamp out all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it is still an outrage", says the chairman of the Democratic Party, legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They are lying hongkongilaisille.
It is clear that we are acting with a dictatorial regime.
The Committee of the Chinese National People 's Congress of China, the Deputy Secretary-General Li Fei, defended the administration, saying that the general as a candidate for settling down in Hong Kong 's leader selection would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, the United Kingdom with Hong Kong China Beijing promised the residents of the region, that it should not be allowed to choose their own leader from 2017 onwards.
China 's leaders, according to Sunday 's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it will allow Hong Kong to be able to vote for direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to control strictly to the electoral process through nimittämiskomitean, being managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong", is adopted.
The decision on the summer was held in Hong Kong, some of the region 's biggest and most attention inspired protests in years.
Democracy campaign was largely behind the Occupy Central with Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the activity of the business district, if Beijing does not grant authentic universal suffrage for Hong Kong.
On Sunday night, only hours after the publication of the decision, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong met for rainfall päähallintorakennusten.
The organisers of the demonstration movement declared the movement to move into a new era and they would achieve protestiaaltoja in the coming weeks.
However, they did not tell the details, apparently for fear that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In its communiqué, published by the online organisers have said that the move "must be the last resort of Occupy Central -tempausta, which will be released only if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way".
We are very sorry when we announce that today the last chance of dialogue has foundered and occupying the centre is going to happen.
The Hong Kong authorities have prepared for the Beijing announcement in the early days, and there were strict security measures on Sunday near päärakennusten government. There was, for example, the police and the barricades; instead.
Hong Kong unrest feeds many of the feeling that residents are slowly losing kaupungistaan power.
The wave of the continent has caused competition for products and services.
In addition, live in fear that Hong Kong 's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the growing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement, because of its exhibitions are threatening Hong Kong elinehtoa - encouraging business people.
"The protest, in which they speak, can lead to major economic losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it lasts", says the legislator, Mrs Regina IP, which has long been critical of the movement.
We do not want that, spreading concern that Hong Kong is slipping away otteestamme.
Such an image would be bad for investment.
China 's state-run media has also been presented with the stories, according to which the Hong Kong fuel demokratia-aktivistit are a revolution in the Western powers "stooges".
This summer, activists held an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which was attended by 780 000 people - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the region 's largest demonstrations in favour of democracy.

Ice Bucket -haasteeseen osallistujalta leuka sijoiltaan
British Isabelle Roberts karjui so hard when his bucket jääkylmää went down the water, that his damaged kasvojensa luustoa.
This Ice Bucket -haaste ended painfully badly.
A woman has been taken to care for her karjuttuaan Ice Bucket -haastetta while carrying out so loudly that her leukaluunsa went sijoiltaan.

Videonpätkästä has become Internet-sensaatio, and it has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitterissä.
From the perspective of wolves ulvontaan (even): How fanimäärän growth can explain?
Today was quite a formidable fiilis.
In this way, said Sakari koripalloilija Pehkonen in 1995, when Finland was played for Athens EM-lopputurnauksessa against France Maroussin palloiluhallissa.
Pehkonen is exaggerated.
I remember the game when it was present.
So too were those of some 100 Finnish, who shouted at 20 000 spectators vetävään, otherwise empty halliin fuss.
I wonder what Pehkonen had said after the World Cup Suomi-Ukraina-ottelun 19 years later?
Bilbao is a 100 suomalaisfanin forces kahdeksankymmenkertaisesti.
The European Championships of 1995 was Finnish koripalloilun etsikkoaikaa.
The men prepared the way for, among other things, overcoming lopputurnaukseen Russian karsintaottelussa Helsinki urheilutalossa.
This victory opened the doors to the cream.
Everything seemed to be a good one.
It was a promising young people, such as Hanno Möttölä.
Raised päävalmentaja Henrik Dettmann Möttölän kalkkiviivoilla lopputurnausjoukkueeseen.
The solution, which many people had different opinions.
Now we can say that, from a distance, Dettmann was a wise one, even though all sujunutkaan did not, according to the script.
After Athens koripallomaajoukkue crashed deep.
The Athens games here on the Finns, was reportedly a total of slightly more than 100.
The group included journalists, players 'relatives, the Finns koripallovalmentajat and a few fans.
Bilbaossakin is journalists, relatives and trainers, but there are also fans.
And there are many of them.
This phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
No one will be able to tell the exact figure suomalaiskisaturisteista.
Estimates have been on the move between 7 500-10 000.
The figure was between anything over there, it is quite incomprehensible number.
Here is the explanation urheilusosiologeille.
In a global economy businesses move across borders.
In sport, there is still an opportunity to look at how we go internationally.
With increased mobility, we can go and see how tyttömme and our sons will be successful in the world, says Professor Hannu liikuntasosiologian Itkonen.
Certainly, both in Spain and in Poland in the World Cup lentopallon is the Finns, who are seeking elämystä.
A common experience.
However, it does not explain everything.
Personally, you must have an appeal.
Itkonen populaarikulttuurin put the sport into the.
The threshold is lower than urheilukisoihin to go to Berlin to see art.
Without success in scale, though, does not get off the ground.
Just look back to 1995.
Then päävalmentaja Dettmann koripalloliittoa and challenged pelaajiakin heittäytymään concerning in a professional manner.
It took almost 10 years to do it.
Then the path changed and it maajoukkuetoiminta was placed on a pedestal.
The movement lentopalloväki did the same a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruits of that work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed tuotteistamaan huippu-urheilunsa, which operates as a sacred triad: Urheilu-media-sponsorit.
The public will then be interested in it, too.
And the media has taught us what kind of supporting karnevalistinen is, Itkonen reminds.
The transfer of this massive palloilulajit are also in the interest of the Sates sarjoihin?
Hundreds kori- and lentopallossa is played, on average, or a little over 1 000 katsojalle.
Itkonen sees the issue as a good, and not necessarily to give an answer, which promise very good species.
The second one, believes in the interest of moving.
The second is the one who does not want a sweet mahan täydeltä.
This elämysmatkaan cohorts is ready for the World Cup, but their perusajattelussaan domestic sarjat kaksisesti are not interested in it.
That is a challenge in the midst of an emotional seuraihmisille.

A smart way to save textbooks
In America Yliopistokirjojen costs exceed $1 000, in the case of many of the students, so there will soon be another incoming opiskeluvuotensa Matt Schroeder fiksun can find a way to save on costs.
He developed a system where subsequent vuosikurssien students borrow books against the nominal compensation, instead, that they would sell books along the same path.
"My mathematics would normally cost $180; I paid $10 for the use of its entire lukukaudeksi tuhdin and the butter", says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his last lukukauden book would have normally paid $430.
Instead, he used them for 120 dollars.
According to the Board of the university keskiverto-opiskelija spends more than 1 200 dollars a year for textbooks and koulutarvikkeisiin, but students have access to a wide range of ways to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly using verkkokauppoja and Schroeder 's idea of the kind of creative approaches.
Increasing numbers of students rent textbooks, when they will be able to use the book lukukauden during the whole time and pay for much less than a book to buy for the students.
More than 250 kampuskirjakauppaa to Neebo Inc rental textbooks, according to the company, has doubled since 2011.
The statistics on the sector reveal that around a quarter of university bookshops books this past spring had vuokrakirjoja, chairman Trevor Neebo-yrityksen Meyer says.
The National Association of College Stores -kauppajärjestön says that less than half of all books are purchased campuses in bookshops.
This clearly means to save money, however simple they may be.
Verkkokaupat
Online shops in a new book can get only a third of the price of what it would cost kampuksen bookshop.
Ron Larsonin, Bruce Edwardsin and Robert Calculus Hostetlerin, " -kirjan Ninth painoksen suositushinta are nearly $290, but the price of a book gets erikoiskirjojen regarding internet sales Chegg.com 239,99 dollars.
Buy used,
Second-hand books are a good option, if the reader do not interfere with the appearance of other notes and passed.
For example, "Calculus", when used -kirjan receives Chegg.com-verkkokaupasta 93,49 dollars.
In the last year of the Brigham Young Universityn student Matt Casaday, 25 years, says it was a book 'Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business', when used only Amazon.com-verkkokaupasta 0,42 dollars.
As a new book would cost $48.
The University of Massachusetts Amherst 's College Without Walls with leader Ingrid Bracey and other academics are recommending that students ask professoreiltaan, can also make use of the lessons of the past.
Sometimes painoksen new reforms are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old painoksen can only find a fraction of the price, which should pay for the new.
Besides Amazon-kirjakauppojen Chegg- and eBay Inc 's Half.com is popular ostopaikka of used books.
Rental
Leasing of textbooks is worth considering if pidät of them to take good care of, you will remember to restore those suoritettuasi and you do not need them in this course.
Hiring you can save over 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, "Calculus" the whole lukukaudelle -kirjan rental costs about 20 dollars.
The company tutustu vuokraavan rules, such as notes, the following payments korostuskynän use and wear and tear.
Vuokraaja, not varuillasi: If unohdat put back in a book, a book myöhästymismaksu can be greater than the purchase price.
These books above
Acquiring e-kirjojen instead of ordinary paper can become also a question.
Sometimes, these books are rented when the owner is paid for the right to use its e-kirjan, Amazon.com-, for example, Chegg- -kirjakaupoille or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Calculus Chegg-kaupasta receives -kirjan e-kirjana" for six months, around 61 dollars.
According to Braceyn, many students of literature are the most, because several klassikoita can now download, free of charge, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
A comparison of the various sellers are worth, as an alternative to the then valitseekin.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon begin Pepperdinen law, recommends to use the book ISBN-numeroa in discovering the price, because it will be able to ensure that, in search of the right book.
Before sitting in the grid, to ensure that the book is certainly in warehouses, Gault says.
He himself has learned this the hard way.
The supply of buying his book had on ice for four weeks, and in the end he was forced to buy a book at full price, the university bookshop.

Putin calls for negotiations on the opening of the new countries Kiovaa Itä-Ukrainan with
Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government will put an end to the fighting against the separatists in the eastern part of the country and start negotiations immediately in the region of the outgoing "valtiomaisuudesta", Russian uutislähteet are telling.
His representative to Dmitry Peskov, clarified later that Mr Putin did not mean that, in the face of the separatists in the eastern Ukrainian region to become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine, need to look again and again, in order to be able to give the power of the Russian-speaking population in the region to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin 's Kiev venäjämielisten government 's call for talks with the rebels as equal neuvottelukumppaneina is responsible for his apparent strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: He is trying to help the separatists to take over the region and force, in this way, the Government of Ukraine, in practice, to grant the newly julistetulle Novorossijalle independence, through which it can be directed towards Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the country 's Kanava -tv-kanavan 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army 's attempts to flood back into the separatist region dominated by Eastern Donetskin and Luhanskin, which the separatists captured in March and April in Moscow annexed Ukraine 's Crimea peninsula itself on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently dipped in the region 's 'Novorossijaksi,' 'Uudeksi Venäjäksi' - this term to remind the Russian superpower revolutions that preceded three-dimensionality days.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tassin, Putin said that the planned peace talks are "an illusion" as long as the Ukrainian politicians are carrying out campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and attacks by government forces against civilians in areas controlled by the separatists.
"We must immediately begin comprehensive negotiations, not only on the technical aspects, but also the organisation of society Kaakkois-Ukrainan and the status of the country. It takes into account the interests of the people who live there", he says.
According to Peskovin Putin 's reference to the "valtiomaisuudesta" is associated with greater independence, which has been the subject of debate for months, with Kiev 's leadership in its efforts to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be under threat.
Only the eastern territories of Ukraine 's government can provide for their needs for the independence, Peskov says.
This issue will not be able to hold talks between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but Ukraine 's internal conflict".
The Kremlin 's representative for heckling, whose purpose was to correct Putin 's comments "a wrong interpretation", pointed out that the Russian administration is dealing with the rebellion in eastern regions the separatists in a different way than in the case of Crimea, leaving it virtually occupied territory whose 2 million people, the majority of the population is ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to link itself even Luhanskin Donetskin or regions Itä-Ukrainassa, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region is not ethnically Russian, and because of the conflict in the previous opinion polls show that the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
Independence, on which venäläisdiplomaatit are discussed in international forums, would allow Ukraine to local governments the right to agree for themselves their own kauppasopimuksistaan and ulkosuhteistaan, which would give the practically Kremlille power in the region, which links Russia with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed by Russia five months ago, is located in the Russian päälaivasto, commercial maritime satama-alueita and historical rannikkokohteita.
The Russian Rostovin and the Crimea in between the region is also in mines, factories and metallinsulattamoita, which produce the Russian army of vital products.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed virkaanastumispuheessaan on 7 June that Ukrainian legislators - after the new elections - are considering constitutional amendments, so as to increase the decision-making power of the Ukrainian ydinalueesta disparate regions on their own finances and the status of the languages.
His vision of independence, however, appears strongly differs from the Kremlin and Moscow lietsomien signs, perhaps, and the sentiment of the separatists.
Putin presented the latest demands to the government in Kiev venäjämielisten negotiations as equal partners with the rebels, after the rebels went further last week by Russian tanks and troops from the territory of the invasion Itä-Ukrainaan earlier rauhanomaiselta Azovin off the coast of the sea.
The Ukrainian security forces fear that the Russian Novoazovskin separatists supported by the erection of the city is the beginning of a larger effort, which is designed to take over the whole of the strategically important coastal region Crimea up until now.
It has led to massive civilian armeijahenkilökunnan to take Mariupolin and the strengthening of the city. Half a million inhabitants are known as the Mariupol steel as a productive satamakaupunkina, which is located on the Crimea peninsula Novoazovskin and leading a narrow area of land between.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday in Brussels, European Union leaders begging for additional measures to prevent future violations by Russia in Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach the point of no return", Poroshenko warned.
Ukraine 's territory is now in the hands of thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks.
The EU Summit did not take decisions on direct action; leaders came lisäsanktioiden issued, so that they can be introduced, if the Ukraine crisis will flare up in unexplained circumstances.
The Ukrainian soldiers were to withdraw from the region by two Russian Ilovaiskin panssariosaston and 1 000 troops Donetskin transition last week to the region, in order to strengthen the struggling separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, Ukraine 's National Security and the representative puolustusneuvoston, told reporters on Saturday in Kiev.
According to the first Russian Ilovaiskissa Lysenkon saartamasta Ukrainian 63 soldiers, was exchanged for 10 Russian laskuvarjohyppääjään, who was imprisoned in Ukrainian territory a week ago.
