Flying Henry says that my father has never hug me.
He never said I love me
Henry was born in the Dudley family of seven Jamaica in the British Midlands in 1958.
The father of the was a factory who was killed at the time of Henry Henry, and the relationship between the Po and the father was remote.
Henry train is currently Rudyard 'Bobsleigh show', which is based partly on a fictional debate with his father and developed on the basis of Radio 4.
The is a mixture of, and Arap up.
Mr is has had to go through the painful childhood of childhood.
He has been a number of therapy after the death of his mother, and he is considering a lot of relationship with his father.
It was very difficult to read the father.
His face has never been seen, only the voice said: there is a fuss.
I would like to leave his brother to peace.
Let us move on!
I am now looking at the cricket.
The old brother and Hilton, which were already adults when I was a child, had a father in pub and discussed, for example, the form of beer or cricket.
I never spoke to him about things.
The majority of my life was a smile man, Mrs corner, to read the newspaper.
Henry to digest in many Dudley and got the impression of what his father's life has had to be, although the working conditions are better than that at the time.
, are a little brighter today, but they are in practice dark, smoke, labyrinth depths in which they eat cheques, smoke and soot.
Father was used to go to the bathwater, and only in our country, and in silence he began to sing in document with a number of dirt.
On a number of occasions, I understood that he had done it for many years to get us to the table and I started to appreciate him more.
Despite this, there was a lack of the proximity of parents from the point of view of Henry 's childhood.
My father was never hug and never said that I love me.
Only when my mother began to sick, before his death, we began to start by repeating ourselves to each other that we love each other.
Henry has the Bill daughter of and, through their own child, he has been able to share his love of a child.
I have to repeat the 'I love you'.
Let us stop the hug!
Father, I am 22!
. with of.
Why should we not be friends?
He is a great mother
Henry is still a good friend of of, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawit is a good person.
Why should the Dawn and I not be friends?
He is a great mother.
Henry mother was diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the death of the mother.
When I started to suffer a lot of overweight and diabetes, my doctor asked me to make a U-turn.
Since then, I began with a great deal, and I also had to start hard to reduce the symptoms.
It is very difficult -
and boring.
No one enjoys carrots.
Henry is well known to the short term, perhaps, as a result of his change in the career process.
Having received a great deal of good feedback on the role of Otho, he is immersed into a theatre.
Next, it was a comedy of mistake and August Wilson's Fender Pisces ('Aid for Aid').
It is a different experience from, and comedy, which Mr Henry has done throughout their urgent career.
Henry began in the field when he was a 16 factory of the 16 factory.
In the counter euphonia, he noticed that he was in the hands of of and contacted the new capacity for competition.
In the middle of the 70 'TV, I was the only black Oxime and comedian', he says.
In doing so, he has done.
I had to grow up in the spotlight, I had to learn to produce jokes from conveyor in 1975 to 1985, while living in 1975 and I was on television, and it was a difficult time.
Johnny New Face in 1975
Henry manager had the scene for the scene Show Show, the light of the lightly entertainment programme, where there was a black Demolished, so the Henry ended up in a programme for five years.
My family did not do so.
On the other hand, I would like to say that I would never have taken part in it, but I do not regret it.
Although it was strange and regrettable, I was able to work in huge events and I learned how to deal with the public.
However, 'British TV rewarded, a multiannual favourite and light programme' was, at the same time, 'grotesque for black people'.
Henry worked in a second farce in the 21st century, in which it was pollutants and admired the black British culture.
The Flying Henry show was set in 1984 and, in the 1990s, the Henry was figure in Gary Black in a comedy series!
For the next decade, there was a number of Henry, documentary, TV and film parts, but the BBC in 2008 said that he said: 'What is going to happen now, it seems to be taking place or moving on'.
The next item was the Radio 4 documentary series' What is the Great About,... '.
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It is not really good for us at school, and I think it was one of the white middle class, which is using stockings and which has money.
That is why I am afraid of Shakespeare.
All the people who are in the programme - Mr Hall, Mr Tre Nunn, Mr Le Rochester, Mr Le - said to me: 'We.
We do not reject the whole idea before we know what we are talking about.
textiles words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry 20 of Mr 20 Mr of the last speech for a documentary and he was sold.
I felt I would be able to do so.
I felt almost as if something had been missing in the past, and now it was put in place.
'What it is about, this is important, so we take it seriously, to learn the learn, to do a small background to the background.
It was therefore a tough process, and I read the play for months before it was implemented.
It was finally a success.
It was apparently expected to fail, but that was not the case.
Shortly after that, there will be a majority of Henry in a comedy of mistake.
All of a sudden, an active player in the British national theatre, and I could not believe it to be said.
I am reminded of the idea: 'O Hedgehog, you have changed'.
For once, there were technical problems in the play, and Mr Henry clearly felt that he had his role to entertain the public.
'small, I said to me:' 'you will have to do 10 minutes alone, until the computer works again'.
Instead, the director of the director announced that the proposal will continue as soon as the problem has been rectified.
I would like to get a facilitate out of the scene, and some of me would breathe a sigh of relief.
It is not my duty,
I can do that.
'You are playing a play, stay in the role'.
Henry 'Fender' in Duchess
The learning of the 'Fender Pisces' play was a challenging one.
panic is a good thing, it makes people more sustainable.
This play, too, was well received, so it was a sign of the gods; 'this is what you have to do'.
It is, of course, the case that Mr Henry has the voice of A.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this work.
I love training.
However, it is still in essence a comedian: the small young of humour are constantly interrupted by the young of his exchange of Mutation.
logistics for up up is a question of will, because it seems to be dangerous for the public to have an immediate effect.
If we are constantly hungry for this, it may lead to an impasse.
I sometimes spend a lot of time in Apollo when it seems, but in general, it will no longer inspire me in the same way as before.
I would like to ask Mr Henry whether he is going to go to the new up tour.
It gives me real pleasure to sit together with the director, who will help shape the whole journey from the start, the middle and the end, and I do not believe I want to give up the feeling.
So this is his new them?
I think so.
I think it is necessary to play a role -
It is very good.
It is a fact that it is a story, and it is a task.
I love stories.
People love stories.

For the sake of the hunger game, the representative confirmed that the images are genuine and condemned the 'arrogant privacy of privacy'.

It is too high.
These Song were, in principle, too aggressive, and they were no longer received.
They were not banned - nothing was actually banned - they were no longer for.
They wanted to leave the oblivion, as was the case in the word itself.
The general opinion was that the laws and the declaration were not achieved: as in the case of literature, people chose to read the heroes, soup books and Esrom,, for music, in favour of Basketball.
day sometimes, the wild Whatever, started with imaginary piano and singing 7 with the big noble together of A.
I did not understand.
'It was the famous Song of Wallis', which was told by the D, and, at the same time, he raised two finger at two at the same time.
That is how his father had always done, before ',', the letter of the letter.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father said that he played the same game with his own father.
If it was decided by the, to start the word, and not to raise two finger at two, we will have to pay a penny.
It was not a very pleasant game, and it was not now.
He knew that it was expected of him, that is all.
He had to explain what the jazz is.
I had never heard such a thing.

In life, there was only one thing for one - the word.
At the beginning of the Song, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It was in the same way that the Clever had been in the same way.
Its anticipate made people nervous.
And the jazz was a new clever through music.
Although, by 10 years, D Davis Davis., the jazz music had become familiar with him through his father's half collection.
Well, at least he did not need to tell the for that Fat Wallis was black.
In view of the age of A, it was likely that he did not remember the time when the singer singer were not black.

I had only heard of Basketball, and he was difficult to understand how the offensive words that were just singing from the D had ever been used as music.
It was the love that was expressed.
'They are not really insulting', Mr D said.
Perhaps it is not just a question of big foot.
My father has never insulted anyone, but this song has made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the rejected garden created the illusion of the illusion.
None of the words into the voice of the giant cabbage in the isolation.
I did not understand, however.
Why was a father, something like that?
He was going to say that the whole story was a joke, but did not want to raise two finger at the consequences of the A.
I saw him as strange already.
'It was a amusing', he said instead.
I was the in disbelief, and his hair was covered by the point of view of D.
There is nothing else to be seen in the world as a huge, of A, the black hair of Andvari.
What he did not want to see.
'If you say so', he said, but not convinced.
However, it does not explain why I sing it to me.
I had the impression that it was truly confused.

He considered it again.
That is not the way in which it is really great.

And you are angry with me, because the foot are too thick?

I do not, of course, hate you.
It was just a stupid.
He could have said 'I love you', but it was too early for it.
'I think that I thick the', he tried to correct the situation.
I am perverse in that respect.
This was not helpful.
He had wanted it to be nice.
After all, when he wanted fun, it was quite different because he, as he father, lacks a convincing charm that can manage a joke.
Perhaps his father had been cruel.
Perhaps he, D, wanted the same.

Is it, I believe, that he is going to be would?
He had never mentioned the life of D in the good archipelago where he had grown, but Mr D was sure that, in essence, it had been the same as life here.

First of all, it was the is word that had been made by the general man and a woman who received a pull pharmaceutical, a pull pull, and then attacks.
On the one hand, I think it was too much, because it was hostile in itself.
In my view, the Solomon language called on him to leave.
He withdrew his' patio 'chair rather than an old man.
In my view, it was also exhausted, but the depth of the sorrow of D was maintained.
This was not the end of the world.

I was following his expenditure - just as he watched his travel partner, spectators, as a window of window - a man who was responsible for his hard life.

He was a pity for D and men in general, although some of them had raised their hands against him in order to attack him.

It is also too long to say that they shed light on the hatred and mistrust of others.

Four Suddenly of better water images and video images
If we want to take pictures or video on water, you have to choose a number of different options for equipment.
The cheapest option is a sustainable, Alexandroff and Hosho camera, such as Nikos or 'camera, such as the Golan Pro + Silver, which both cost approximately USD 300.
I personally took these images into a family celebration, using a number of cameras, each of which cost less than 350 dollars.
In the case of the laws, there are a number of rules that are worth complying with.
I am going to check the equipment twice.
Although you would be a watertight camera, I would still ensure that the camera battery and other parts have been closed watertight.
In addition, the camera description of the images or video on the description description of the camera.
There is a regulation in some cameras or camera and video camera to optimise the conditions under the water.
In addition, before jumping to water, let us ensure how deep the equipment can be.
Some cameras only 5 footprint, some of which are 50 - 60 of the footprint.
I would like to see both ordinary and water management models in our purchase guide and in the criticism of the digital cameras.
There are many images - many of them in some way.
In the toolkit, the cameras have the LCD evidence to be able to show the image of the Marmite, while the ', often, does not have this quality.
Although you would be LCD, it is difficult to see the water, and the picture can either succeed or fail.
So there are many images.
If the camera was also allowed to be fork, which means that many images will be taken by different regulations, it will take advantage of this quality.
It is close to the surface.
The light is significantly reduced by deeper.
If possible, it is close to the surface when it comes to bathing water, lakes or the sea.
In this way, you would also think it would be more colours; the more lost, the less the colours will be.
I will try to come to a close.
This is important in the advice of the country, but even more important by water, because the light is limited.
It is very important when there is a 'camera: there is often a fixed lens in these equipment, which has a broad picture, that is to say, the described, so that we can fulfil the whole picture.
China does not allow the Hong Kong leaders to elect their leaders - the revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that the electorate in Hong Kong should not choose candidates for the 20 elections, despite the unease of democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protests of the Hong Kong Movement for a long time to plan and implement demonstrations only for hours after the publication of the decision.
The decision of the People's People's Congress of China, in practice, will give the communists out all the candidates who do not comply with Beijing.
'It was expected, but it is outrageous', says the President of the democratic party, Mr Lauk.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They have been lied to Hong.
It is clear that we are working with an autocratic regime.
The Chinese Government, the Deputy Secretary-General of the National Congress of China, has defended the Chinese administration to say that the general candidate in elected the Hong Kong leader would be too 'chaotic'.
Since 1997, Great Britain's extradition to China promised to the people in the region that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017.
According to Chinese leaders, the decision on Sunday was a democratic breakthrough, because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the appointment of the committee, which is managed by Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who 'love land and love Hong Kong' are approved.
The decision before the summer of Hong Kong was held by some of the largest and most significant protests in the region for years.
Behind the campaign to defend democracy, it was largely the Central of the Love and PEACE movement which the organisers have threatened to prevent the business of the world Quarter if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, only hours after the publication of the decision, hundreds of the support of the Central Bank met in the main administrative buildings in Hong Kong.
The organisers of the demonstrations announced that the movement would move to a new era of civil disobedience and would bring about waves of protests in the weeks to come.
However, they did not tell the details, apparently, that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In the communication published by the network, the organisers said that the business' must pyromaniac Rapture as a last resort, only if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way '.
We very much regret the fact that the last opportunity for dialogue has failed and the centre of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been prepared for a number of days in Beijing, and on Sunday the security measures were tough on the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
The lack of peace in Hong Kong is feeding many of the feeling that the inhabitants are slowly losing their power to their city.
The wave of arrival on the continent has led to competition for products and services.
In addition, there is a fear that Hong Kong values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the growing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticised the Central Central movement, because its demonstrations threaten the lifeblood of Hong Kong - the business world.
'protest, which they talk about, can lead to major economic losses, depending on how many of them are involved and, for a long time,' says the Ip, who has fought for a long time.
We do not want to see that the Hong Kong is sliding away from our grip.
This image would be bad for investment.
There are also stories in the state of China that Hong Kong's democracy activists are the henchmen of the revolution Western powers.
This summer, activists organised a referendum on the informal voting rights, involving 7 000 people - more than one fifth of the Hong Kong electorate.
In July tens of thousands were involved in one of the most profitable demonstrations in the region.
The proactive of the United States is hitting British universities: new jet
We are inspired by the demand by setting up the first luxury class in Britain to travel to today's students.
Not only does the company provide private aircraft, but also other vehicles, such as Rolls Phantom, the Martin or McLaren CFP, so that the customer can ensure as memorable a university as possible.
According to Mr Stewart, there is also a safety aspect in the service.
The service is the best possible alternative to students who, otherwise, would be dragged by their property in children cars.
When this is combined with a number of IF characteristics (hospitality), we are ready to offer today's students as easy and high quality transport as possible.
According to the company, there have not yet been reservations because the service has only been set up, but it would add that 'students will start orders during the next few weeks'.
The company believes that there is a demand for the service, even though most of the students pay for the figure of GBP 9 000 per year.
Today's students are very different from their expectations and wishes, from 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, and now it is more important than ever to create a memorable first, and the IF is precisely the right way to do it.

With regard to the Finnish people in the Games in Athens, a little more than a hundred have been told.
There was a number of journalists, relatives of players, Finnish basketball drivers and a few fans.
Bilbao, too, has journalists, relatives and prepare, but there are fans there too.
And there are a lot of them.
This phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
Nobody will be able to say a precise figure for the Finnish Games.
It is estimated that there have been between 7 500 and 10 000.
Whatever the case, it is quite incomprehensible.
This is an explanation for sport socio-economic.
In the global world, businesses are moving across borders.
In sport, there is still an opportunity to look at how we are at international level.
As we see more mobility, we can see how our girls and our son are successful in the world, says Professor Hannu It of sport.
I am sure that, both in Spain and at the World Cup, there are Finns in Poland who are seeking a experience.
Joint experience.
However, it does not explain everything.
Sport must also be a source of attraction.
It will raise the popular culture of sport.
There is a lower threshold for sport than the art of Berlin.
Without success, however, there will be no movement.
Let us return to 1995.
At the time, the basketball union and the players took the basketball union and the players, too, in a professional way.
Almost ten years have passed.
It was then the direction that changed and the national national action was taken on a pedestal.
It was the same movement that was carried out by the aircraft at the same time.
Now, both of them enjoy the fruits of their work.
As Mr It says, both species have managed to produce the top, in which the holy Trinity works: the sports sponsors.
We will also be interested in the public.
And the media have taught us what this herds of the double is, Mr It remind.
Will the species be able to make this massive interest in other other?
For average, there are hundreds or over a little more than 1 000 to the ball.
It Parkkonen, and it does not necessarily give a reply to very good species.
The second school is to believe that it is going to move.
The second is that which does not want to be fresh from poverty.
This lot is ready to go to the World Cup, but their basic thinking is not of two interest in their own country.
It is a challenge for people in a euphoria.

save in the learned
The cost of university books in America is more than USD 1 000 for many students, so the Matt Matt, which will soon be the second year of study, will find a smart way of saving costs.
He developed a system in which students from the later years will lend their books to nominal compensation instead of selling their books in the same way.
'countries in my book would normally cost 180 dollars; I paid for its use for the whole number of the figure of 10 dollars and I support the bread', a 19 Schroeder, who is studying in Covenant in Georgia.
The Schroeder says that his book would normally cost USD 430.
Instead, he used the 120 dollars.
According to the Board of the University, the average student uses more than 1 200 dollars a year for textbooks and school products, but students have a number of means to reduce these costs.
The students are increasingly deciding to use creative approaches such as online shops and Schroeder.
More and more students rent textbooks, when they will be able to use the book for a whole period of time and pay much less than the students buying the book.
More than 250 books have been The, according to the The The, that the temporary of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
The statistics in this area reveal that, with some quarter of the books in the in shops, the chairman of the Chebotarev company, Mr Tre Meyer, is telling us.
According to the National Association of Store, less than half of all books are purchased in bookshops.
This is the simplest way to save money.
Online shops
In the shops in the shops, a new book can only receive a third of the price that it would pay for the trade in campus.
The recommendation of Paulson, Bruce and Robert Host, the recommendation of the recommendation 'Homunculus', is almost USD 290, but the network of special ," at the price of Chea," is at the price of USD 23 23.
used used
The books used are a good option if the reader does not disrupt the notes and the appearance.
For example, the 'Caldas Homunculus' book has been used for trade trade.
Ilham Young University for the last year of University Casa Casa, 25 years, says that they have bought the book 'strategic Media de MEDIA', used to use "trade in Amazon."
A new book would have paid the cost of 48 dollars.
The University of Massachusetts, College, College, Ingrid Bracey, and other academic figures recommend that students ask their professors whether the previous emphasis can be used on the course.
Sometimes, the reforms of the new emphasis are not essential for education.
In this case, the old emphasis can only find a fraction of the price, which should be paid for.
In addition to the Amazon shops, eBay "has been popular with the purchase of books.
Temporary
It is worth considering the temporary of books if there are good concerns about them, so that they can be restored, and that they do not need to be carried out in the course of the course.
by to save more than 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, the temporary of the 'Caldas' book will cost around USD 20.
I the rules of the van company, such as the contribution that has been made, highlight the use of pen and the use of the next payments.
Temporary, I am vigilant: if you forget the book, the late payment may be greater than the price of purchase.
The particular
to books, instead of ordinary paper, can also come to the question.
Sometimes these books are rent, which will be paid for the use of a book on the right to its holder, such as Amazon, Chea or Barnes and shops.
In the case of the trade in Kellogg, the 'Caldas' book 'Homunculus' - the book for six months, will be recorded in a period of six months.
According to the Bracey, many students in literature are most economical, because a number of Schiller can now be download, while books in the field of science and technology may be very expensive.
compare the different dealers is in favour, and that is what the choice is.
29, 29, which on the basis of d d right, will be recommending to make use of the Greek number, because it will be able to ensure that the right book is sought.
Before there is room for the network, I will ensure that the book is certainly in place, the Gaulider says.
He himself was the Achilles' learned.
The book he was buying was four weeks left, and he has finally got to have a book at the full cost of the university's book trade.

The Tampere Government is dealing with this issue today.
Animals hope for a strong support for the initiative from the city.
In the case of the leader leader, the Tampere I in Tampere, there is a danger that Mrs del's in Finland and the world should come to an end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, the world has fortunately taken a general view that the del of developed mammals such as dolphins in del Calvary is not animal welfare or ethically sustainable.
This view would also be given to Tampere.
The abolition of Calvary is not only a question of animal justice, but also a question of the image of Tampere as a tourist destination.
According to the risk, the death of the Daphne dolphin will strengthen the requirements for the dismantling of del Calvary.
The death of Daphne is a sad continuation of the dark history of Särkänniemi del's.
It is time to put a stop, to close the dolphins prison and to make it clear how the dolphin of Tampere could be transferred to the border area, a kind of dolphin safe home, the risk of condemned.
The Daphne did not have time to return to the original body of dolphins, but hopefully the remaining dolphins in the peninsula peninsula will be able to experience a more than a impetus, a impetus, the risk of a condemned.
Animal protection, the aim of the animal welfare union, is to ban the use of all wild animals in the circus for the overall reform of the animal protection law that is being prepared.
This is also the case for Mrs del's.
In support of the requirement, the Animal, the condemned, is in danger of taking part in a demonstration today on 1 9.
The demonstrations in the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will take a position against the hunting of the dolphin in Japan.
During the period, some 2 300 dolphins are being imprisoned or killed every year, either for the use or for food of the for.
Putin calls for negotiations on the new state with East Ukraine to be opened with East Ukraine.
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, insisted on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government will end the battles in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the 'asset' of the outgoing region, the sources of news in Russia.
His representative, Dmitry Pest, clarified the fact that Mr Putin did not mean that the eastern Ukrainian region of the separatist country should be part of Russia, but that its role in Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to allow the population of the Russian-speaking region to defend their own rights and interests.
The demands made by Mr Putin to Kiev in the negotiations with Russian rebels, as an equal negotiating partner, responds to his obvious strategy, since the violence started five years ago: he is trying to help the region and forces the Ukrainian Government to make the independence, which will allow it to go to Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with state Canal, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's attempts to powers the Eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region of the separatist Donetsk and Luhansk huge in March and April in Moscow on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently seen the 'new instead of Novo', 'new Russia' - this term reminds us of the glorious days of Russia " s great revolutions.
The Russian news agency, according to Mr Putin, said that the planned peace negotiations are 'illusion', as long as the Ukrainian politicians are taking campaigns for the parliamentary elections on 26 October, and the government forces are attacking civilians in separatist areas.
" " 'We need to start extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the countries of south-east Ukraine, which will take account of the interests of the people who live there.
the, Putin's reference to 'property' is linked to greater independence, which has been discussed in months with the leadership of Kiev in trying to dispel the fears of the Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the independence they need, Pest.
There can be no debate on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Pest, 'because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine'.
The between remark by the Kremlin, which was intended to correct the 'wrong interpretation' of Mr Putin's comments, emphasised that the Russian administration is dealing with the separatist uprising of the eastern regions in a different way, when it is in practice an enormous area of the majority of the population of 2 million people.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to include itself in Donetsk or Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not the Russians, and, according to the opinion polls prior to the conflict, the majority of the population was in favour of maintaining Ukraine.
Independence, which Russian diplomats have discussed in international fora, would allow the local authorities in Ukraine to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin in practice a power in the area of Russian Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was linked to Russia five months ago, is based on the Russian main fleet, the port areas of commercial shipping and historical coastal areas.
In the region between Russia and the Crimean region, there are also mines, factories and metallic lightning which produce vital products for the Russian army.
The President of Ukraine, Petro Timoshenka, proposed in his speech on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislators - after the new elections - are considering changes to the Constitution in order to increase the power of the regions in different areas from their own economy and languages.
However, his vision of his independence seems to be radically different from that of the Kremlin and Moscow, perhaps weapons and up by Moscow.
Mr Putin expressed his latest request to the government of Kiev to negotiate with Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels moved further by Russian tanks and troops in eastern Ukraine in the past in the Azov Sea coast.
The Ukrainian security authorities are afraid that the involvement of the separatist Novo Brest-Litovsk Brest-Litovsk, supported by Russia, is the beginning of a greater effort to powers the whole of a strategic coastal zone.
It has led to the strengthening of the Mari city of Mari,, which, in half a million inhabitants, is known as the produce port of Novo Brest-Litovsk and the Crimean region of Crimean.
