The goal Chelsea gets the new season Premier League precedence Thibaut Courtois, Czech Republic for the first time in ten years at the London club in the position of alternate.
Some time ago there was speculation that they would Cech might be interested in Real Madrid.

It has been speculated interest Paris SG.

But according to British bookmakers Čechův departure from Chelsea at the last minute it is very likely.
Skybet he announced a rate 4: 1st
Peter, it is possible that even during the remaining few hours to change the jersey?
I do not count with it, but in football nothing is ever foolproof.
Maybe the day will come when an offer that will not reject.
How would such offer had to look like?
(Laughs) "Well, I still do not know how such offer, what it can not refuse, actually looks like.
It would have to come to a consensus of all parties Above all would depend on the attitude of Chelsea, if he could offer a possible deal with the club or not.
Is it technically feasible to make such a change, if you're in Prague now?
You would not need to live in a new home any new contract signed?
So I have not thought about it.
But in such a situation today is a lot of players, they are all somewhere on the ceremonial rallies and certainly today still plenty transfers closes.
So somehow feasible it would certainly have been.
How many clubs on the planet, which would you be able to afford?
Well, I really do not know.
And what you are not pushing for secession?
A situation where I was in the first three matches of the new season could not determinate, for me, after fifteen years of a new career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack up and go somewhere.
I want to contest for the position of goalkeeper Chelsea continue to participate in and to the coach, who chooses what decisions to make during the coming weeks.
What role in your decision making plays family?

It is essential for me, of course sporting perspective, but looking at it from a personal page that the family's needs obviously belongs.
It is possible that you also fielded for another club in England?
That is a question which I thought me never not be affected.
But in football anything is possible.
I do not want to excrete.
I do not know the answer.

Restoring very American ideal that labor rights are also human rights
Congressman Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill that is organized in unions to protect a civil right.
"The way unions work, work jobs for the middle class," says Ellison, a Democratic senator from Minnesota, who is co-chair of the Congressional committee.
That's why I'm so proud that I, together with a pattern of occasional Rights John Lewis introduce a law empowering employees.
This groundbreaking legislation gives workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in organizing in unions, as with other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-union forces
Modify the law on labor relations so as to enable all employees who face discrimination if they want to join a union, to sue in civil court - and sue for compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it certainly is not a radical initiative - at least not by US standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other applicants submitted in the law, is reconnecting with the American ideal.
Despite the union fight, which took place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labor rights.
There was a time, millions of Americans still remember when the country was in the same breath promote democracy, freedom of speech, press freedom and the right of assembly.
When the United States after World War II occupied Japan, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisors encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that military autocracy Hideki Toja will be replaced by democracies.
They were convinced that employees and their unions play a role in shaping the new Japan include in their language and openly acknowledged that "the right of employees to gather, bargain and act collectively is guaranteed."
When the United States after World War II occupied Germany, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged Germans to create a constitution that ensures that the fascism of Hitler will be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that workers will need new people to organize and promote, and therefore include a clause that says openly: "The right to create associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions will each individual and every occupation or profession guaranteed.
Arrangements that restrict this right or will seek its damage will be canceled. Measures to meet such a purpose are illegal.
When the former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement to include in it the petitioners and Roosevelt guarantee that "everyone has the right under the protection of their interests to form labor unions and to join them. "
A whole generation of Americans accept the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advising other countries how to build a civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to form labor unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now, when these rights are attacked in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right in a free and open society to organize and promote.
As fifty years ago, said the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr .:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the unions diminished power of the nation, but extends it.
Increase the standard of living of millions of people, creating a market for industry and manufacturing lifted the intriguing level.
Those who attack the unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget and we also did not have.
Formal recognition of labor rights as human - and extend the protection of civil rights so as to prevent discrimination in organizing trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renewing the ideals that lifted America and make it real the promise of democracy.
A judge temporarily blocked a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked Louisiana law that lawyers would probably shut all five clinics performing abortions in the state.
Regulation enacted by signing Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which has come into force on September 1, after the doctors performing abortions were required to have the right to take away a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of the performance of their practice.

It was not immediately clear whether the decision applies to the doctors of the two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs, and also asking for such a license.
Louisiana is among the eleven states have approved similar laws, the courts in Alabama and Mississippi such measures provision declared unconstitutional.
Key parts of Texas law that would conclude the majority of the remaining clinics in the state blocked a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women's rights to abortion, together with the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association argues that the need to have the permission of a doctor puts the requirements that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion opposed by measures aimed at protecting women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that because of the measures would be closed clinics.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said that Louisiana has a permit only one physician performing abortions.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, the doctor would fear for their safety also stopped performing the procedure, said the group.
Louisiana authorities in response indicated that they would not penalize doctors who perform abortions, while waiting for processing applications for the granting of rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor access to treatment in the country kills ovarian cancer more often
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video tribute to his late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women, the Australian countryside higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
The researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australanek diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35% five years after diagnosis lived.

The lowest survival rate was observed in elderly women whose cancer was diagnosed at an advanced stage.
For women in rural and remote areas of the country was about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women were living outside the city more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says that the factors may be late diagnosis and poor access to treatment.

Garden centers regret reducing the number of home owners
According to HTA study published by the Financial Times, a decline coupled with the extraordinary decline in homeowners younger than 35 years could lead to the fact that until today's young generation of consumers has reached a "major age groups gardeners' garden centers come up to ten million pounds annually.
According to the report spends his garden, people who rent housing, on average, 55% of the amount spent on people living in her.
Other factors threatening a sector that earns an estimated five billion pounds per year, shows an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are gardens, front yards instead of flagging popularity used as a parking area and the shrinking size of the gardens.

When Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin at a meeting of its youth organization, which to me most of all resembles Hitler, rattling nuclear weapons and basically all made it clear that their views are stolen from him, today gave us a lecture on democracy.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia has many features of the Fascist state.
Great nations have one thing in common and that is that it is able to dominate both the heightened nationalism and the inferiority complex that it can transform the imperialist appetites.
Time passes to the east obviously different than in the West.
While the Western world thought that the era of wars for dominance over Europe's long gone, to the east, on the contrary think that has long been neglected and needs to regain its international position.
Such mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the thirties, just before the seizure of power by the Nazis and then followed the explosion of nationalism, unlike the current situation in Russia.
And then that is identical cult strong leader, beating journalists uncomfortable liquidation of political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, that it is indeed quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and certainly a large part of Russians are probably miss the time when Russia was ruled half the world, and the second part is trembled before them.
Perhaps it Western politicians have caused ourselves, maybe a little pat on the shoulders of Vladimir, maybe invite him go where he wanted, and maybe underestimate started and he just acted like a typical Russian peasant.
He made a tidy home, pretending that he actually did not want to go anywhere at home, sharpening knives.
Now he decided to conquer back lost ground.
Begins slowly has time.
The leader is about life and where it rushed.
Caucasians trod, now trample Ukrainians, they are at least dwarfs the Baltics.
I've Russian bear bite in a fur coat long enough.
That I will certainly notice and China, who jumps too much and certainly does his eye on the Far East.
And those Germans that angered Vladimir too pretty to be good, and I gave them the 45 and on the backside.
How about making one new Novorosiju in Carlsbad.
That would be our základnička and there's a lot, and as there are oppressed and dacha leckterému he wanted them demolished.
After all, our veterans doteďka vzpomnají, how would we Czechoslovakia.
Nu vot Indeed one of their premier Gospodin Sobotka, who is so Mecca, it can be like to peel the onion and eat the whole of the EU.
That would play to enjoy the great Russia jumped.
It should remind them of their place.
And as detonators use our fellows who reside in their territory.
Russians are everywhere enough and when you say that there is wronged, so there's just oppressing us and we will not let it, we'll protect you.
And again, the Russian reign, for what other purpose is born.
Europe is obviously good only as a preposition, which can be proud of Ivan Cossack dance.

You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice: "Stop that racket.
Leave my sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a kid, they were adults - with him went to the bar and talked about things like the shape of a glass of beer or beauty stroke in cricket.
I had never spoken like this.
Most of my life it was a serious guy in the corner who is reading a newspaper.
Henry recently visited a foundry in Dudley, and though the conditions were better than in my father's time, it looked into what for him must be life.
Nowadays there is a little more light, but it's still dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth, where flames erupt and there is a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always got in the tub and just lay there, then you could hear how slowly begins to sing for myself, because of myself washes foundry.
As I passed, I realized that this was done years ago to support the family, and I started to appreciate him more.
Despite Henry's childhood without parental love.

Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a very, very big overweight and began to show symptoms of diabetes, the doctor told me: "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to a large fitness center, and I had to keep a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
A tiring.

What was "years and years of award-winning main product of British television", but was also too "grotesque parody of blacks."
In 80 years, Henry worked in the alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who simultaneously mocked and glorify British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984 and in the 90s he was known among other things as a chef Gareth Blacklock in a comedy series Chef !.
It took another decade commercials, documentaries, television serials and roles in movies, but after airing the series on BBC LennyHenry.tv in 2008, said, "So what are you gonna do now, Lene, bit it is seems stuck on you one spot, or miss a bit of the way. "
Next up was a documentary on Radio 4 called What's So Great About ...? / What's so great about ...?
The first was Shakespeare.
Shakespeare I had a serious allergy.
In school I did not learn it properly, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone with whom we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, saying: "You should try it."
Nenavážej into it, if you know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you will see why we are all so fond of Shakespeare.
Henry delivered a document to twenty lines of Othellovy closing speech and he was in on it.
It gave me a feeling that I can do it.
As if it gave me courage.
"That's what it is. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn to text, something you find out about it.
So the test was hard and I had read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were waiting for trouble, which did not happen.
Soon he began playing in Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre. I could not believe it.
At one point I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical problem and Henry felt instinctively that he must take responsibility for seizing the audience.
"The voice in my head said, than the management computer, you are now ten minutes to talk. '"
Instead theater director announced that the show will continue once the problem is resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Well, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Can solve it for me by someone else.
"You play and stay in role."
Henry in a fence at Duchess Theatre
Learn the text fence was a challenge.
Panic is quite good, adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a divine sign that says: "That you should do."
Of course, it says in a loud voice.
So there I stay.
I'm really happy.
I'm glad the trial.
Henry nevertheless remains comedian brain - the whole time our conversation interrupted by humorous performances, which enters and exits the role imitator.
I decided to do stand-ups because they have the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I think.
When still looking for something you can get into a blind alley.
Sometimes, when I want, I do Live at the Apollo, but I'm not happy as ever.
I asked if she would ever organize a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in the same room with the director, which helps give the outlines of the beginning, middle and end of the road - I do not think that I ever wanted to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think yes.
I enjoy acting.
It is fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public officials to get shined to a nonexistent employee
Kenya began with a biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove from the payroll of government-existent employees.
According to statements by the government to stop employees in the next two weeks, do not register, receive payment.
The Government believes that thousands of people have been paid, even after left government service.
After the 2013 took office, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in public administration.
Audit conducted this year showed that the state loses a month at least one million dollars (700,000 pounds) on payment of non-existent employees and further misconduct.
The government suspects that salaries are still inserted into the bank accounts after the death of an employee or after the employee leaves the government, said a BBC reporter from the capital, Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All state officials must within the next two weeks to come up identification centers, where they recorded their biometric data, said in a statement the government.
He says that anyone who fails without sufficient excuse, will be removed from the payroll.
"By determining the actual employees of the public service, this measure will contribute significantly to rationalize and will be used to clean the payroll at both levels of government, and thus solve the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.

Police Office has not commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, was among those detained fourteen high-ranking officials.

Most schools in Ukraine on Monday (September 1) after the summer break open again.
This day is traditionally important for families and thousands of other parents and Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took my daughter to school.

In Ron Fairheadové maybe BBC boss found for hard times
He carries with him the clouds of glory from the world of banking, media management and internal conclave of conservative parties.
Sam has experience from the front lines.
Her career began at the consulting firm Bain and Co., then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and media world Pearsons.
Seven years was executive director of the Financial Times. He resigned when the highest office in the parent company Pearson's cast her younger colleague.
It is said that her severance approaching a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former director of BP when Cameron in Whitehall needed private expertise: become an advisor to the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former city council member.
In May, I described the work as the director of the chalice of poison.
Not only is the BBC's vast and intricate entity at the heart of public life, but in its structure, there is also an internal paradox.
Corporations are turning in two directions: in the top layer of the hierarchy of the BBC's own leadership, but also out on the voice of the public in times of unrest, when things are not working.
It is an almost unsustainable monopoly, which calls for a thorough reform.
Which director would but risked coming to a company as complex as Chinese dynasty, spread it, and thereby prepares himself for a job.
It's a difficult challenge.
If it was not so hard, a lot of people would like to see how the BBC shrinks - its power, its finances - and how to revise her status.
As it expands the range of competition and new technology challenges the old certainties, entails the immediate negotiation of license fees for the BBC great danger.
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 a year to the British public buys stake in what is surely the largest media company in the world.
BBC tells a good story: claims that its output reaches 96% of households, and yet each is just 40 pence a day.
Additionally, the popularity of BBC obviously increases: 53% of supporters compared to 31% ten years ago.
Models use BBC services have changed: Today my headlines displayed on the mobile phone and shows that I missed, I can look at the iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very dear and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope one found.

The extraordinary demonstration of acclaimed new novel by Howard Jacobson about love and the letter "J"
Dissolve it, that's the best way to describe it gradually spread like a cardboard box, which someone had left in the rain.
Only from time to time a woman told him that it was too serious, complex, sharp, isolated and perhaps a bit irritable.
And then he shook his hand.
Irritably he admitted it.
He could sting like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this ability has been incipient love affair that is more than usual, promising relief from his lonely life of boredom and perhaps even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomonsová was fragile beauty with a wild mane of hair and the fickle heart of the village on the northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
South came with an older companion, which is Kevern thought that her aunt, who inherited the estate in a humid, but beautiful valley called, aptly, Paradise Valley.
In the house a few years no one lived.
Leaking pipes, the baths were dead spiders, slugs are slimy sign on the window, as if they thought that this place belongs to them, the garden was overgrown with weeds and resembled a huge cabbages.
The house looked like a cottage out of children's stories, scary and beautiful at the same time, with a garden full of secrets.
Profile Author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the Man Booker Prize, 2014.
This shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern with Ailinn sat on folding chairs in long grass and holding hands, enjoying surprisingly warm spring afternoon, absently tuned into a public station that supplied the region comforting and soothing music news, when in fact he look at her tanned legs crossed recalled the old song long-forgotten black comedian who retracted blinds enjoyed listening to his father.
Do you have very big feet.
Due to their natural aggression had such songs played on the radio.
Were banned - actually banned was nothing - it just did not play.
They helped them get into desuetude, as the word itself desuetude.
People's taste proved what could never regulations outlawing, as well as people, as far as books, collect memoirs, in which the poor become rich, cooks and love stories and music are collected ballads.
Caverns to let go the day and began playing an imaginary piano and rough, comic sang serenade Aillininým big feet.
Ailinn understand.
"It was a popular song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
It always did his father, he wanted to suppress the letter j before he comes out of his mouth.
It started as a game, when he was young.
His father said that he played the game with his father.
When you are with words that began on j, they gave two fingers to her mouth, cost you a penny.
Even then it was not very funny, and it was not even funny now.
Only knew that it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what it's jazz.
Ailinn never heard of any.
Neither jazz, although he was not directly outlawed played.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
In life, it was only room for one "if".
When she began to play melodies, people wanted to know exactly where the ends.
Same with humor.
His unpredictability went on people's nerves.
A jazz humor was expressed in song.
Although up to ten years heard of Sammy Davis Junior, known Kevern jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin but did not say Fats Waller was black.
Due to her age, she could not remember a time when blacks were not popular singers.
Also, without laws or coercion.
Docile society is one in which each part with gratitude - gratitude of those who were fortuitously saving - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of African-Caribbean origin are thrown temperament and constitution of dyeing and athletics, and then sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent, though naturally gifted for electronics, take responsibility for the fact that no family will no functional phone.
Poles who remained were plumbers, Greeks who stayed washed dishes.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents quickly leave the country, as happened WHAT HAPPENED, if it happened - they were afraid that they would be accused of stoke up the fire, actually fearing that the fire next time spend They are - opened a restaurant selling labneh and smoked hookahs, warned anyone about yourself and inaction is slowly consumed.
To each according to his talent.
Given that just listening ballads Ailinn was hard to understand how the dirty words that she just sang caverns could arise music.
Music was an expression of love.
"In fact, do not swear," said Kevern.
Maybe just for people who have very big feet.
My father never offend anyone, but he liked that song.
He talked too much, but neglected garden supplied the illusion of security.
Soundproofed leaves behind could not avoid a word.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but was reluctant to put yourself in her presence again with two fingers to his mouth.
I thought he was weird.
"She seemed funny," he said.
She shook her head in disbelief and overshadowed Kevernovi views.
The whole wide world has seen nothing more than a tangle of her raven hair.
Nothing else did not see.
"If you say so," she said doubtfully.
But it still does not explain why I sing to her.
She looked really upset.
I have very big feet?
He looked again.
Feet really do not.
Maybe a little ankles ...
You say you hate me because I'm too fat ankles?
I hate?
It is not true.
It's just a silly song.
He could tell her "I love you", but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles just attracted me," he ventured.
I was kind of weird.
That is wrong.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, often got him into trouble because, like his father, lacked the charm necessary to prove tame the cruelty that lurked in jokes.
Maybe his father was deliberately cruel.
Perhaps he was intentionally cruel caverns.
Despite the gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomonsová blushed and stood up on chairs, threw the radio and spread unfinished wine.
Elderberry wine, so drink as it could.
She seemed to be trembling in their excitement as palm leaves in a storm.
"I perversely attracted you're a moron," he said ...
Except that it does not attract me.
He was sorry for her, both because of her unloving words and because of the fear that was in her eyes when it opposed it.
She thought that it hit?
She speaks to him about life in the cold northern peninsula, where she grew up, but doubted that the foundations it was the same there as here.
Shattered on them and the same vast Arctic Ocean.
Same insane men, then what happened, even more irritable and more annoying than their ancestors, smugglers and spoilers, angrily wandering from pub to pub, ready to reach out to any woman who would dare refuse them or ridicule them.
Jerk?
If he is not careful, she will perform his fists!
Her first hug - hug has become the most common term for erotic stimulation between a man and a woman: antibody dull ballads about love, which spewed radio - first pomazli her, then she punches him.
According Kevernova opinion excessive politeness, because cuddling was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomonsová him nonverbally signaled to leave.
He rose from the couches like an old man.
Sam felt annoyed, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
Yet it was not the end of the world.
They almost did not recognize.
She watched him walk away - as if he were watching from an upstairs window - the man who drove what he has caused.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart sank for him and for all men in general, regardless of the fact that few of them beat her.
The man turned away, shoulders slumped, ashamed, defeated, any militancy left him - why she felt that this look familiar, though she could not remember a single moment until today, it would have ever seen?
Ailinn Solomonsová, alone again, looked down at her feet.
Some twenty years after these events Esme Nussbaum, intelligent and enthusiastic researchers working in thirty-two Ofnow, non-statutory monitoring system public mood has prepared a short article about the persistence of mild to moderate acts of violence in areas of the country where the mitigation or directly stop the most anticipated, If his removal was spent enough money and energy.
"It made a lot a lot has still to be done," she wrote, "to calm innate aggressiveness of people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in Buried, hard to reach areas of the country, where despite the tips of church steeples rising above the hedgerows touch of human kindness historically appeared only rarely. "
But some things are irreplaceable.
It would seem that the higher the steeple, the lower instincts.
Residents sigh of sentimental ballads, stories and devour the unfortunate state that strongly believes in the value of marriage and family life, but not only in rural areas that cares brutality stubbornly holds just as in urban areas, but the evidence also shows that at home, in the workplace , roads and even on sports fields emerges a new intolerance and aggression.
"Unfortunately, you tend to květnatému style too," said her supervisor.
I would suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
Also, I have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I have the impression that I do not have to answer," Esme said Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again protested his right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
More silence.
"I do not ask why," he said Rabinowitz, "that I have anything against atheists, feminists or lesbians.
On this site we prejudices.
We serve unprejudiced society.
But a kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is perfectly acceptable and laudable, can sometimes distort judgment, as you've demonstrated you.
Apparently you yourself biased towards the church - things you call "cruel" and "brutal" others might interpret as an expression of natural strength and energy.
I still deal with what has happened, if it happened, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, preparing the ground with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke Nussbaum Esme looked around.
Behind his head on the scoreboard flashed pink recommendations Ofnow broadcast to the world the last quarter-century or more.
Smile at a neighbor take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, chat, explain, arrange to apologize.
Talking is better than silent, the sung word is better than the written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand your concern," she said quietly Esme Nussbaum when she was sure that her supervisor was finished, "and I'm not saying that the wound did not heal the way I like to think that heal.
My particular concern is that if we do not advance alerted repeat the same mistake, which led to what happened, if it happened.
This time the anger and mistrust will not vent on the other.
Luther Rabinowitz steepled his fingers.
It should indicate infinite patience.
"You are going too far," he said, "if the steps that maybe did not do, and maybe your grandparents, you're describing as errors.
Too much and you treat that you talk about, that they vent their "anger" and "disbelief" to "others."
I would not have someone in your place to remind you that in the past, understanding and protection presence in talking about "us" and "them."
There was no "us" and there were no "they."
We know only that it was a chaotic time.
"During which, if we are honest with yourself," Esme picked up courage, "None of us is without sin.
I not blame anybody.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened, happened.
That was before.
This is not what you say - in this we agree.
And just as there is no guilt, which could be someone to blame, there are not things that should be corrected, or if the remedy was appropriate and possible.
But what else is in the past, than for us to learn from it -
The past exists to forget about.
If that's anything I can say -
Luther Rabinowitz tripped fingertips.
"Your report will take into account," he said, dismissing her.
On this day, when she went to work as usual, knocked it motorcyclist who drove on the sidewalk in a way that passers described as "brutal and violent."
Coincidences happen.
Army LESOTHO Kingdom maintains that no plans no coup - Prime Minister remains in South Africa
THE KINGDOM OF LESOTHO military officers denied that they had organized a coup to overthrow the government, claiming that they acted against the police suspected of attempted armed political zealots.

Manufacturing in the euro zone is at a minimum thirteen
The growth in production is closely monitored by the survey in August in the euro area slowed to a thirteen month minimum.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro zone (PMI) fell from 51.8 in June to 50.7 in August.
Figure greater than 50 indicates expansion.
Fewer new orders and factories damaged the growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The numbers come from the Thursday meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets want a clear plan from the bank to deal with oddalovaným recovery of the euro area is a threat of deflation with inflation stagnant at 0.3%.
Rumors that the director ECB Mario Draghi maybe this week signaled it was considering quantitative easing euro zone, similar to the one for what during the financial crisis joined the United Kingdom and the USA.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect, which has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty to the manufacturer, it is becoming increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
Manufacturing PMI in Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU fell to eleven-month low of 51.4.
The zone's second largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern regarding France, Italy again went from expansion to stagnation.
Signs that the driving force for growth in the major industrial regions in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands also disappeared, is also not very reassuring, "said Dobson.
Industry slowdown is likely poured oil on the flames analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news came from the Irish Republic, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to be said about the manufacturing purchasing managers' survey for August to say is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: Producers in the euro area currently have a very difficult life because of rising geopolitical tensions - particularly between Russia and Ukraine - adds to the increasingly challenging conditions in many countries even more uncertainty.
This heightened uncertainty clearly affected business - especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders will be delayed or even canceled, especially those costly.
He stated that as "more probable" it appears that the ECB will eventually have to carry some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect to be limited."

The boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed that his mother is dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia children begin school at age seven) and survived the three-day school siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At that time, seven years said: "My mum told me that if there was an explosion, I lie down on the ground and hold her hand."
After the explosion he thought his mother was dying.
She told him, "Run."
He was afraid she was dead, fled, and the way he saw the crying toddler grabbed the child's hand and ran a spray of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed him outside, he said, "Damir told me that his mother is dead."
He said: "I could not save her."
In fact, Tamara stumbled upon freedom and lay in the hospital with a wounded leg, and vice versa thought that her son had died.
After they met again, she said: "I cried with happiness.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (by the defunct newspaper News of the World), which was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie declared the winner Bernardo's Children.
"The horror of daily returns, but I wished I could to stop thinking," he said yesterday.
But I can say that memories already fading.
I remember that right after I threw all my toy guns.
But today I can play computer games in which they shot and I have no problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but do not think for themselves.
I remember the children with whom I played in the yard, and that did not get out.
We never say that they were killed or they died.
We say that remained in the gym.
On a trip to London, I remember well, mainly on how I'm in a toy could choose anything I wanted and how I went convertible.
Now he was worried about places like the Ukraine, where the war suffer as he suffered and his friends.
The horror of daily returns, but I wished I could to stop thinking
"I'm terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror," says Damir, who last week participated in volunteer activities in the monastery.
I want so much to help.
Once again I want to work with the police and hope you'll take next year at the academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: "They killed 37 children in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence after the attack. Nowhere were no children who would not be here screaming and ran, and the silence lasted several months.
Vividly remembers the trip to London with Damir.
When I have the story told in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how he can express his support.
She was thankful Cherie Blair and her Foundation for their award and the opportunity to go to the autumn of 2004 in London.
Wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though it's been ten years, I can still remember a meeting with her and her husband in London and both me and Damir help.
I remember how Damir had a taste for borscht, and then called every Russian restaurant.
I also remember how you played in a restaurant with waiters, Damir them fired a water gun and they ran and played with him.
And it was just a month from the horror.
I was surprised how us Brits like to share our pain and how to support us.
She said: "I still think that the world over the past ten years has not changed for the better.
Now it is a war in Ukraine, every day people are dying and I think it will be killed and yet many children.
They're the same kids like ours.
I think that for many people the war is just something in the news that you listen to when you are bored or while doing something else.
I know what these people are experiencing, what kind of horror.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir has grown and he is a nice and quiet guy, not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, desire for revenge, that he could not care less.
I know that it does not like to remember, but it has a lot of close to six classmates and from time to time go to the gym and there kindle candles.
When he was small, he had problems with it - remember how you ever lay down on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lying clock.
He slept, his eyes were open.
I also remember that blew all my gun or other weapon to play with. Damir today is 17, is taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe I have a few hours was sure he was dead and that he would never see again.
When I recovered after the explosion and rose to his feet, I looked around and saw hell, everywhere lay pieces of human bodies.
I was pretty sure that my little boy did not have a chance to survive this hell.
"I remember how I cried, Damir, run, run! ', But I was convinced that I heard.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life goes on, unlike other away.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
Boy whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Consolation: Survivors of Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, Grigory right now
When he ran for his life after Chechen terrorists shot his classmates, he was in his bloody face engraved fear.
His photo was one of the most shocking atrocities in Beslan symbols.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, he landed his first day at school, and hurried to take his older son, Vladimir university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists stormed into the yard, so my little boy there three days left alone," she recalled.
Not alone because we had relatives there, but all died there.
He survived only my Grigorij.
How is this date approaches, it is still difficult to think about and talk about.
In less than a day for us to not remember the tragedy.
Does not seem to us that it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments I kept coming back.
I promise that no one will ever forget.
Haunting memories: Photo Gregor (left) was one of the most shocking images of attack, and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember that day Grigory really looking forward to the school, he said he wanted to hug my teacher.
I am alive, I learned, when I saw him on television.
The San Marino is even a statue of a weeping Grigori.
Grigorij at the picture looks not like a home we have it hidden in a bookcase.
I understand that, but I also think that because the image people around the world know how much pain we feel.
Today Grigory says: "It is important for this to happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still investigating, but no one would ever find out the truth.
Now investigating the crash of the Boeing Ukraine.
We'll find out sometime, what was the cause?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
"I do not understand why this is happening, because when people ask, nobody wants war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is not such a pain for nothing.
Us a little bit forgotten needs for decades.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years I had nightmares about the attack, but then it got better.
When I came in 2004, he returned to school every day, I was terrified.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
Therefore, when approaching September 1, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of childhood friends.
It is difficult for me to join the gym, but I must.
I do not feel like a victim, and this story of the past.
I forget it, but I do not regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
First I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but because of my health, I could not.
I wanted to fight for their country, but will not do it.
Grogorij Farniyev 20
The boy, who survived, although he was kept at the feet of murderous terrorists
Miracle: Gregori Farniyev was held during the attack at the feet of murderous terrorists, but still managed to survive
When the attack was underway, he was captured imprisoned in the gym, sitting next to the bomb at the feet of murderous terrorists.
It's truly a miracle that he survived.
"It seems to us as if it were yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but due to injuries he sustained during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I threw.
Now I'm older and it is said that children with bad experiences can deal better - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I went to a psychologist, and I was then a little better, but I can not forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I walked into the gym again.
I fainted.
Already there never again will not go and do not ask me, please, to show you where the familiar figure sitting.
Survivors: Gregori Farniev today on a laptop with his photograph taken in hospital after attack
The pain is great, and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know that I hate thinking about it or talking, and never at school do not ask me.
Regarding physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful on his knee that I hurt, but I walk normally.
But I could not because of the health board and studying at the academy in St. Petersburg FBS as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports and answered me that it was not possible.
My other hobby animals, so I got the vet.
I finished there second year.
They learn how to treat all animals from "Cats after a cow".
He said: "I know that my children had never interpreted not.
It's not something children should know and certainly not something that should be experienced.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "The pain will always be there.
Inside it is getting worse with the approaching anniversary.
Attending the ceremony commentary.
I know that Gregory has not.
It must be for him even stronger, because there, unlike me, I was.
I was waiting for him at home and I could not help him.
I am so grateful to God that I returned it. Here in Beslan are clues everywhere.
It remains with us.
Gregori is grown today, but the horror carries on.
It is hard to accept when you become something so terribly unjust.
It's a boy, he likes sports, but can not do it because of my knee.
He underwent several surgeries, can walk, but not practicing.
I would say that 50% already surpassed the terror, but to overcome it completely, and can not forget.
This terrible experience with us will be kept.
During the attack, they killed a lot of our friends and neighbors, and it only worsens the pain.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me and that's the greatest gift which God could give me, it hurts me to the loss of those killed.
I know families in which more children were born, but also to widows who have not remarried.
It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if you do not.
I will never forget how my heart almost jumped out of his chest, when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I watch what's happening in the world - wars in other places.
For those people who are struggling?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now coming to our country, which I can hardly believe it.
In the past we were one friendly country, and how we got that together we fight now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure that many children in Ukraine has been and still will be killed.
If they could all those rebels to collect and throw away - as far as it will go.

4 tips on how to take better underwater photos and videos
If you are interested in photographing or filming underwater, you have a large selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 camera or outdoor type + GoPro Hero3 Silver Edition, which costs around $ 300.
I took these photos at family gatherings several cameras, all cost less than $ 350.
No matter what equipment you use, but for best results, apply a few rules.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set the camera depending on what type of photos or videos you take.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scene or shooting mode, which optimizes exposure for dark environment underwater.
And before you do that you start, find out how deeply you can submerge its equipment.
Some cameras are intended only to five feet, the other 50 to the 60th
Read our guide to buying digital cameras, and evaluation of current and waterproof design.
Always do a few shots - a lot of them fail.
Compact cameras have LCD to help you compose photos but do not have it outdoor.
Even if you have an LCD, underwater will be difficult to see and framing will be unpredictable.
So always make more shots.
If the camera has bracketingový mode that makes a series of pictures with slightly different exposure variance, take advantage of it.
Hold it close to the surface.
With a deeper immersion light decreases significantly.
If possible, hold when shooting in the pool, lake or sea near the surface.
It also lets you capture more light on the pictures - the deeper you dive, the less you see the colors.
Get close to your subject.
This is excellent advice, if you shoot on land, but underwater it is even more important because of the dimmer light.
This is especially important when you shoot with the outdoor camera: Such devices typically have a strong and wide-angle lenses, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you have to get closer to objects.
Andrew Lawson was the man whose strength of personality could change things, even such a large organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist he has dedicated their careers to the sick relieving pain caused by the disease and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help, the MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that maimed him.
Lawson realized that while physicians focus on diagnosis and disease treatment-experienced patients overwhelmingly interested in something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, but it was he who began to suffer.
"I do not feel in your skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He wrestled with flu symptoms and found that impatient and his wife Juliet involves remorse.
He noted: "I want everything was happening sooner rather than later."
When Juliet week went on a business trip, Lawson was uncharacteristically and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
A colleague had made a chest X-ray.
One two weeks before skied in the French Alps.
X-ray results came.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or if the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine what was causing them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer smoke.
Mesothelioma is but another.
In almost all cases, the cause is exposure to asbestos - a fibrous construction material that was previously described as "miraculous", but now knows he is deadly.
For most of us, it was not hard to ignore mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belong to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 60 years of the entry into force of the ban on the use of asbestos in industry.
Even at a time when asbestos was used, with him into close contact come only certain groups of people, such as insulation fitters, builders, carpenters and dockworkers.
The toxin used in industry in a different era now hardly seems cause for concern.
But such complacency is misplaced.
As it turns out, in Britain today culminates mezoteliomová epidemic.
The number of mesothelioma deaths is higher than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths from the disease each year is more than twice the number of victims of automobile accidents.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma annually since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in the UK
Why only now we feel its effects, though the use of asbestos for years illegal (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades to develop mesothelioma.
Disaster in the form of mesothelioma not does not only veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases still is, present in homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in schools, where they teach and in the stores where we buy.
Mesothelioma thus does not respect social class, wealth, occupation or age.
Privileged bastion of London department stores around public schools do not pose a shelter.
And Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even hospitals where they treat us, they are the repository of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Neither did not think isolation.
He tried to figure out where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then it came.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and porters - corridors used.
The question is how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately it was a question he could partly answer.
"Of the four doctors who were practicing in Guy's Hospital and which was then in the past five years showed mesothelioma," he said in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma, when he was 48th
When February 17 this year died, he was 55th
Surviving with this diagnosis so long is not normal.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
Disease is always fatal.
Now we can only repeat Lawson question: "How many of us sick with the same disease?"
According to a leading British expert on mesothelioma Professor Juliana Peta best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic happening in Britain, died about 90 000 people.
Most of them currently has no idea that she would die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A cursory inspection of documents from the archives of the courts, which are often addressed disability and require settlement shows how much mezoteliomická disaster spread.
For example, in June acknowledged the Marks & Spencer that recklessly expose asbestos Janice Allen.
For string he worked for nine years, from 1978 to roku1987 when oversaw two stores in the clothing section - one of the sites was the company's flagship shop on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when for M & S started working.
Today he has two children, which is over twenty.
"Before this happened," she says, "I'd never heard of mesothelioma, I hardly knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed that I would be able to somehow relate.
Not too many people who know something about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name was given because of its fibrous structure that gives it strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals were used for building three.
Most often today in buildings can be found chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, bojlerových seals and even the brake pads.
Not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, EU and WHO him yet considered "high health risk", which can cause death.
But it is dangerous brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say that "there is compelling, but circumstantial evidence that it was the main reason for the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK]."
Employee Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the flagship store in Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen might not be considered as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian PETA points out that her story is not at all unusual.
His study of patients argue that a "substantial proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
A substantial portion of this exposure is caused by "normal exploitation and weathering" buildings.
It seems that nobody can be sure it's safe.
Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the middle of the government do not realize that they are possibly exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report according to which the service elevators and pipelines for the parliamentary committee rooms contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be broken by something as innocuous as a "strong stream of air."
Ministers are often accused of that care only about their own interests, but in this case may be the opposite is true.
Although the headquarters of Parliament's services insisted that the Palace of Westminster received "positive medical certificate", it counts now that will need one million pounds a few years of work for Parliament to be inspected thoroughly modernized with electricity and remove asbestos, and that After the elections in 2015 MPs rather than on the green benches at Westminster to sit in the conference center of Queen Elizabeth II.
Goddard stands in the report that "the presence of asbestos is not in compliance with several regulations."
It is not possible to say whether this inconsistency will cost lives.
Everyone now can only wait.
One of the people who were never able to determine when they were exposed to asbestos, is Graham Abbott, doctor.
Just like Andrew Lawson has Abbott (50) suspected that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital, where he demonstrated the presence of asbestos," he says, "but in my case I can not prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked, and when he worked there.
But clearly remembers the day in early December 2009, when it It could do something like chills.
He was 45, and the evening was just in the middle of the operation.
Suddenly, I was shaking.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought it arrives drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain comes from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
But just as Janice Allen had no reason to believe that this is a mesothelioma.
Finally, he spent a month at home.
He confused the doctors did a chest x-ray thoracic catheter introduced him to his lungs removed fluid, they sent for analysis.
Still not specified a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
From time to time it but symptoms returned, often after the work-out and winded up.
In 2011 he came to the operating room, one of Abbott patients with similar symptoms and was subsequently subject was diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, nothing Abbott did not join his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and in the work he came into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case the connection clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again and the doctor consulted on the images of CT and X-ray with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel sick, she was the space between the lining of the chest cavity and the lining of the lungs introduced probe equipped with a camera.
I'm an optimist.
I have a tendency not to take anything you very much, "he says.
To be honest, I did have to worry about.
But Rachel, my wife, do not worry.
Biopsy results arrived between Christmas and New Year: "They told me that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began to meet with the sisters of charity Macmillan and one had told him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have an asbestos thermal insulation pipe," he says.
For people who were in those buildings exposed to asbestos, the disease is now beginning to show.
Mesothelioma is therefore now starting to involve younger people who do not have risk profession.
The most dangerous pipe thermally insulated with asbestos in hospitals housed in the basement, it was unlikely that would endanger patients.
However, staff members who have passed through the basement corridors between buildings (as Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (often as Graham Abbott), certainly in contact with a toxic substance came from.
As it now appears, they were a few decades after the war hospital a place where patients could save your life, but also a place that could endanger the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos was removed today.
Pupils Bunsen burner built on asbestos pads
And not just the hospital.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulating and fireproof properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, many people were exposed to asbestos in school.
Somewhere in countless hours of chemistry students built a Bunsen burner on an asbestos pad.
Created a website dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools.
Innocuous things like floor tiles or roof sheds for tools in our homes usually contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built up a large number of houses," said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case took place only contact with asbestos, to which the woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember in the 70s when demolishing the garden house.
So be careful how Bori garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, a diagnosis is a huge impact.
"It takes a while before you realize," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I found that I could not concentrate on what I'm doing.
The operating room, I was two weeks.
Then I realized that I have to go and deal with himself.
Well, next Christmas will nedožiju.
One of the hardest things was the transition from position to position the patient's doctor.
Like countless patients before and he remembers how he felt confused about the amount of information with which it had to contend.
"It was hard to understand everything," he says.
"I asked the doctor:" How much time do I have left? "
I was told that twelve months.
I remember how I thought, "Well, next Christmas will nedožiju.
That's it. "
Mesothelioma is a particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer, which kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos consists of fine fibers.
When asbestos fibers breaks and breathe, they can settle in the pleura, lung epithelia.
Asbestos fibers pleura irritating and can cause mutation of cells.
"Problem represent breathed asbestos fibers in the form of needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a heart surgeon, who in 2001 joined Guy's Hospital.
To the same hospital, where he was Andrew Lawson apparently exposed to asbestos and that is paradoxically leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos are likely during practice at the hospital.
Needles asbestos come into lung tissue, said Treasure, and "respiration itself is pushed to the edge where the lining is located.
By their nature, from the very beginning invasive.
Mesothelioma current therapeutic options used in other types of cancer do not take up so much.
Hotly debated example of the efficiency of operations.
According to some would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can not remove the pleura," he says.
Get past her scalpel.
Cancer "too unresponsive to chemotherapy," which, although "has any effect", but not a cure.
"Occasionally, someone who survived lung cancer," says Treasure.
But eventually everyone dies.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After finding mesothelioma Abbott contacted with Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, he became an adviser and personalized support for people with disabilities as well.
They cried, cheerfully introduced himself: "Hello, you've reached the headquarters of cancer."
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
The disease was diagnosed four years ago and it was still very active.
At the beginning of Abbott offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which lasted four months, and he would probably have prolonged the life of just one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson but "managed to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduskim of the department of thoracic surgery at the hospital Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage that I did not have to wait until they send me to him, but I was just there and they called me view for viewing," says Graham.
Normal patient would have to get an order form and they would have had to approve the payment.
To be able to get the best available treatment for patients with mesothelioma question of money is crucial.
But when various treatments will eventually and inevitably fail, many patients face additional financial concerns - about the future of the family, they're leaving.
And therefore appeals to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, it was known that asbestos is harmful," says Morgan.
In the 60s, however, it found that even a very small amount may pose a health risk.
And here we meet the company's negligence.
Andrew Lawson, and Guy's Hospital is finally settled, but according to Morgan, it was not "full-fledged settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mesothelioma due to exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
After investigating the case, however, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbestos in the basement of the incriminated was removed in the 90s."
It was for Andrew Lawson's too late.
How to remove asbestos
Seduce exposure to deadly asbestos on one company or place of work - typically decades after it happened - for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation turned out to be a huge problem.
Much former workplaces changed hands or gone bankrupt.
Evidence fuse is lost.
And those who are now prevented accusations have time on their side, which the applicant was not.
In response to this fact was this year approved an important new legislation that makes patients with mesothelioma easier to claim compensation, even if it is not possible to trace their former employer.
The Act created a 350-million cash reserve, which is paid by the insurance company, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but not whom to sue.
In this case disabilities receive 80% of the amount you would in a normal case, the court has awarded as compensation - about £ 120,000.
Every year is expected to successfully processed 300 applications.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma think that £ 350 million is a "good job".
"It is an agreement drawn up by insurance companies for insurance," he says and points out that the amount is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if not intervened time and people with mesothelioma would be able to ascertain former employer and normal way is to sue.
Even Mike Penning, former minister of labor and social affairs, acknowledged that the law "had a gap."
But Penning Morgan acknowledge that due to the seven deaths each year was necessary quick action.
"People do not really suffer and need help now," he said Penning in December last year, during the second reading of the law relating to mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was under the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunskiho 19 months.
After initial consultations suggested Lang Lazdunski-operation, which, unlike Tom Treasure thought he had a positive effect.
After surgery, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - triple therapy, for which Lang-Lazdunski boasts survival rate for five years up to 40% of patients.
Abbott's strengthened.
"It's obviously not the most important thing," says Abbott.
Patients can see it all the time.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose the leadership - the protesters promised revenge
China's parliament, despite the increasing number of discussions about democratic reform on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the elections in 2017.
It is likely that this will cause long-promised protests in the business district of Hong Kong, as activists began to organize and prepare just hours after this announcement.
Chinese People's Congress basically allows communist leaders to exclude any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"Although it did not surprise us, but it infuriated us," said Emily Lau zákonodárkyně, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of China's decision said the deputy general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Fei, that enable public nominations in the leadership election of Hong Kong would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong China Administration, Beijing promised that starting in 2017 the residents will be able to elect the executive branch.
Chinese leaders Sunday presented the decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong allows direct voting decisions but also clearly indicates that Chinese leaders are firmly in the hands of the process of the nomination committee, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause will be admissible only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong."
The decision came after a summer that saw some of the biggest and most watched protests in Hong Kong for several years.
For the majority of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong stands occupation movement iQur with love and peace, whose organizers threatened closure of the financial district, Beijing if they are granted universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the movement occupation in the rain gathered in front of government headquarters in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration organizers said that their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience, and that in the coming weeks will launch wave of protests.
But they offered no further details, apparently wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In its Internet statement the organizers said that the movement was "considered the occupation of the Central Office only as a last step if it exhausts all the possibilities of dialogue and is left with no other option.
I regret to inform you that today have exhausted all possibilities of dialogue and occupation of the headquarters is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong to Beijing on notice throughout the day on Sunday and prepared to strengthen protection of the government headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
Inciting unrest, according to many residents of Hong Kong sign that slowly loses control of the city.
Influx of people from the mainland increased competition in products and services.
Also growing concern that values ​​such as democracy and freedom of speech are increasing pressure from Beijing bent.
Some people criticize the movement occupation headquarters are located, and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - Lifeboat Hong Kong.
"Protest is talking about, would cause far greater economic damage, depending on how many people attended and for how long," says Regina Ip politician who criticizes the movement in the long term.
We do not want to spread fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could harm investment.
Chinese state media also arrived in recent days with news that democracy activists in Hong Kong portray them as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer of activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which lost 780,000 subscribers - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the area.
Election propaganda?
Liga Jihlava wears a name by the political movement
Small football plays in the regional capital of the Highlands about 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their top competition of the newly dubbed Together for Jihlava League.
The name was given by a movement that goes to the October municipal elections.
Ten on the list of candidates is also head of soccer in Jihlava Jan clouds.
"It was the General Assembly, where no problem was," said Mráka.
The situation around the first league soccer is already engaged lawyers Jihlava Town Hall and can change the system of allocation of subsidies.
Soccer won last year by the city around the web million.
Also this year, in terms of the amount in the hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion it is not the procedure soccer against the law or regulations of the municipality.
But the situation is for the Office impetus for updating rules allocating grants and subsidies, "said a spokesman for the municipality Radek Tulis.
Receive subsidies from the city and at the same time expressed as soccer support in elections one political party, that's probably not.
Vysočinský on the "big" football similar request from politicians yet come.
That maybe incurred CSSD regional championship, division or ODS KDU-CSL first
A similar class and competition?
I would not have to.
Conversely, I would have liked to contact us sponsors from among companies, "said Chairman of the Regional Football Association Miroslav Vrzáček.
The boss of a small football other parties and movements do not let the league title
According to the soccer players would enjoy the sport in Jihlava deserved its own area with six pitch, changing rooms and bathrooms.
"For example, courses on Stoupách not ours, we are there in rent," said Andrew Lapeš the club Starlet Jihlava.
Best location would be Czech mill.
But there are going to build, for example, in my opinion, nonsensical area for skaters, which in Jihlava about fifty, "said Mráka.
Jihlava Mayor Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that uses soccer field with artificial grass in the streets and on Rošického Stoupách which are owned by the city.
We want to build such a pitch that they have maximum utilization.
We're going modernization or construction of sports facilities at the school, which will open in the afternoon.
I think for a little football in recent years made enormous strides, "he added Vymazal.

"Let but voters assess whether Mr. Mráka uses small soccer club Jihlava town and subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American Tradition penetrates into university life - freshmen could flying jet plane
We are glad that we can respond to the demand by lowering the first luxury travel services for students in the UK.
For the purpose of leaving the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers shipping options, including private jet or units of the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin and McLaren P1.
Stewart also said that the service has its own security page.
Service is the ideal option for students who would otherwise have to haul your stuff across the state in dangerously laden car.
We look forward to our VIF (Very Important fresher - a very important freshman) variants of this year, students can ensure that they arrive at university with minimum anxiety and maximum luxury.
A company spokesman said that since the service launched yet, do not have any reservations, but added: "Students can begin making reservations within the next few weeks."
The company also said that even though students pay annual tuition fees in the amount of £ 9,000, expects the service to market will find its place.
Compared with students before ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today's students are different, in terms of the expectations and aspirations - is more important than ever to make the right first impression and VIF program is exactly the appropriate way to do this.
The National Union of Students but the service criticized as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the Union of Higher Education, said: "For most students is such a project unachievable.
A lot of students who this month embarking on a university must, before blowing one thousand pounds for something as simple as to arrive at the college cope with the financial crisis, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants can not keep pace with the rising costs of basic necessities .
Feminists after the events in Ferguson opposes racism and police misconduct
At the beginning of the month he killed a policeman in Ferguson, Missouri unarmed young man.
Present awaiting burial with hands up chanting, "Hands up, do not shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri due to the shooting of an unarmed youngster Michael Brown, a noted blogger Miriam Zoila Perez shift in internet discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to enforcing reproductive rights and equal pay, gender feminists prefer Caucasian race before.
With increasing tension in the Midwest, which drew the attention of the national press, Perez have noticed that the reactions of white women with a 100% focus on the race.
In comparison with the reactions of black women shortly after the shooting on August 9 with personal articles with headlines like "thinking white women over Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
According to Perez but it represents a significant change.
"I think the feminist movement are not many people who would be on race and privileges spoke at such a level," she said.
People felt that for what has happened, it has to give.
For the crisis we are facing, it is characterized as [a situation in Ferguson] is so racially pronounced that it had to draw attention.
According to Professor of English at the State University of Ohio Korithy Mitchell Ferguson brought to light the problems that African-American woman must face every day, and that in the cultural sphere are perceived as "women's issues".
"I can publish on Facebook funny stories of life with your partner and get a 150 likum from people all over the world," said Mitchell.
When I write something that coloreds are in their own country in a trap, it's a deafening silence.
"How is it possible that a woman could talk about relationships, but not on safety in public space?" She asked.
For colored like Mitchell, who addressed the issue of race, gender and sexuality in American history, exists between issues of race and gender dichotomy.
Colored according to her, could not afford the luxury of these issues clearly divided: every day living in this mixed reality.
Although white women today, the question of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles merge, Angela Hatteryová, professor lecturer women's issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890 there were at least 10,000 blacks lynched, and the reason was in almost all cases of rape white women, "said Hatteryová.
To justify a lynching you needed collaboration white women.
According Hatteryové split between white women and black woman came when suffragette Susan B. Anthony explored in the late 19th century landscape and realized that the electoral law can have only one group of people - women or blacks.
"They decided to bet on the card voting rights for women and the right for blacks to be addressed later," explained Hatteryová.
When we realize this, we gain important insights into why women of color white women believe.
We did not do a good job.
We never černoškám helped protect their spouses and children.
Even after women in 1920 received the right to vote, it took ten years before they began to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was founded 40 years after he first told me about the colored help.
According to Mitchell surge of white feminists responses to questions that happening in Ferguson brought - the question of police misconduct, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists have to "catch up" questions with which colored faced generations.
"Would not it be great if activists in these areas [traditional feminism] take the right to raise the child as seriously as we take the right to contraception?" Mitchell raised.
The second wave feminists, who have made a career fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now finding what it means.
Significant feminist activists like Gloria Steinem married two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown attack Facebook, which published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian, who demanded that white Americans have protested vigorously against racism.
"I hope that women who have different, yet similar reasons for the understanding of the dangers in society - and views on race that in the polls differ significantly - will seek to change," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem holds intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the question of race in America, some people confuse.
Experts from the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book "Who stole feminism?" She said to The People, the young men in the United States, mainly young men of color are "much more vulnerable than their sisters', but notes Steinem parties Ferguson faces criticism engendered earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program My Brother's Keeper, which is meant to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it caused among many feminists, including Gloria Steinem furious reaction.
Police relationship to the black community is not the only issue that gets to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After US border police arrested this year in the southwest of the country nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors, again raised the question of the reform of immigration laws - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercadová, co We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women to reform immigration laws, said that in order to be able to present the issue for women as necessary, all you had to do was to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," says Mercadová.
Given that most of the work permit is granted to men, women who come to them, they find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have women's organizations in response," she said.

I can not afford.
At full speed you've mastered the five stages.
What you have felt?
Very good.
I felt like a youth.
We were quick, while I did not go through Vint.
Everything was caused by a car we piplali more than half a year to make it on some level.
The race showed that we succeeded.
You started it so that you could actually think of victory.
Myself and I prepared the car so that we really had to win.
Work being lost.
On the other hand the result which we can contemplate, was not available.
But it's Barum Rally.
Technology unfortunately she did not.
You were not one of the tip who prematurely withdrew from the fight for victory.
They dropped and foreign Breen favorites, Abbring or Lappi.

But he paid for it, he flew off the track and took a nearly two-minute deficit.
How were you satisfied with his performance?

Oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you can not let expose the physician the sick, which serves as proof of an organization that can not for health reasons to perform job duties.
In addition, the absence have not notified the employer immediately.
Consequently, although there was agreement that the days will be recorded as a holiday, but the agreement was only verbal.
Although the Labour Code does not oblige keep writing to confirm the agreement of the employer with the use of vacation, in practice, this procedure has proven.
If there is only a verbal agreement, you do not have an agreement confirmation.
Later, it may be supposed consent to the use of vacation, as well as in your case, denied and absenteeism considered as long unexcused absence, hence the reason for immediate termination of employment in accordance with § 53 of the Labour Code.
In case of litigation about the agreement with the employer you so lacking demonstrable proof.
Employment with you but has not been canceled in accordance with § 53, only the days you have specified in the credit worksheet as AWOL.
Unexcused absence in the credit worksheet has the same consequences as § 53 (eg. The inability to receive unemployment benefit), yet it is difficult for them to find new jobs.
We recommend that you revisit the doctor for writing to confirm that there was indeed an accident, due to which you were unable to work (they are not called. "Sick", it is only proof of a doctor).
When searching for a new job, you can submit the said document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate how exposure to written medical confirmation of incapacity and early notification to the employer or request written consent to the use of vacation.
This will avoid possible complications.

For the second time this year we had to clean the well.
The whole we've always released, which originated almost second pond surrounding the cabin.
Then we were poured Savo.
Incredible stench!
Our well in the cellar rendered always plenty of wonderful fragrant water.
And it was not terribly professionally done, her grandfather vydlabal yourself.
Long time ago.
It was just three rings and a total of quirky, as indeed to all hut, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until letoška.
When we launched the season, obviously we ran out of water.
When she stood there for several months, she deserved it.
But even then it seemed to us that the water somehow smell.
He wondered if there was anything from falling.
At the point where the pump is going through, it was a bit of bad luck may be, there are quite secluded plate and the hole sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, water could not see anything, and we prosvítili it to the bottom.
So we've again released and purified.
Of course, we improved improvised seals around the pump tube.
In the basement but we noticed strange things.
On the floor lay a sticky package with some cubes.
So it seemed.
And farther down further.
Now it looked like oslintaná mouse.
For the ceiling, in places where there are vents, grandpa invention, the remnants of fish!
A heavily jeté!
Our cellar is too racy.
Some would say that grandpa just podhrabal chat.
And would not that far from the truth.
The walls and floor are just packed sand, only ceiling soffits.
They put there by the ships.
A round.
A deck chairs on the beach.
Gates wide-open spaces was mostly how there all the time someone walked.
In several earlier mentioned ceiling vents.
Without the network, so there's normally zalétávají birds and the rafters to build their nests.
The mouse is not necessary to mention.
Grandpa wanted it to luftovalo, and it's quite okay.
Now, however, even Luft help.
The whole basement smelled.
So we cleaned the whole cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!

It would be hard for us went snacking.
Grandpa attacked a neighbor who is not quite right.
If he Franta us the most unsavory there nešoupnul vent?
There's virtually year-round, stupid ideas that he has.
We decided cellar and well supervised and checked regularly.
After a few days everything was fine.
The water we started using again, so far only for washing and laundry before they finished the tests, but it was good.
Pull water from a forest spring is nothing I wanted to do something for a long time.
Once we heard the terrible anxiety of our barking dogs.
Mom looked down from the balcony and saw the grass next to the porch long thick black hose.
Reza above it bounced and squealed like crazy.
Mom scolded her because they thought she dug Reza waste hose from the sink.
But suddenly the tube partially rolled up into a ball and partially straightened.
The balcony came the hiss.
Reza was hysterical.
We ran down.
Snake, well over a meter long and thick as stockwhip, was about to swallow a huge toad and Reza her being hampered.
It was not clear whether she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat alone, but that was irrelevant.
When she saw the snake superiority in the form of our whole family, probably he thought I let her get eaten So, when we are so hungry and elegantly stretched flue to the basement.
We flew behind her.
Like lightning jumped as well.
By the way, we saw her on board more smelly package.
According to some fishy smell.
Yesterday was not there!
Our new security around the pump was a little awry.
And we have a cellar was locked during the day.
That ...
We went out there and we all lay on one vent.
We did not wait long.
For wells that zašramotilo.
First came the flat head with yellow marigolds around his neck.
Then he surged to a snake well.
He wrapped around the pump and began to conquer inside.

Come on, a little further, you can do it or how I enjoyed the We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared us for a few changes.
The greatest change was the route which led to the riverside goal instead lead back to the Yellow Spa.
On the race I was looking forward along with the rest Rungo.cz team, I was going to spend it but a little bit from the other side.
With the whole team we decided to personally greet our readers to stand where together we took pictures and filmed videos.
To his view from the other side dragged to perfection, I accepted the role of personal conductors.
Along with friend Káťa we just before the start obedient ranked last corridor 60 to 70 minutes.
We greeted with some friends who walked past us into the sector for faster runners.
It could do much time.
A few hops to warm you up, turn on the sport testers, and start the countdown!
Shouts of jubilation, but instead followed the quick start scurrying to the starting line.
After five minutes we reach the gate, we turn on the measurement and start running at the rate of ten an hour.
Intertwined with yellow snake runners who like Katya running your first race.
Yet they all look fresh, slowly declining sun in the sky adds perspective Vyšehrad almost kitschy touch.
Throbbing flesh stretching along the waterfront looks like he's running the whole of Prague.
On the waterfront between Vysehrad and National Theatre traditionally begins to manifest, who has much power.
Lightweight scoop on Palacky Square, forcing many runners to slow down or go away.
Just before overshoot to the theater to see a police escort, and right behind it flies Vitek Pavlišta incredible pace to the finish.
I hear the sighs of admiration ufuněné other runners.
Moving to the edge of the track, I encourage him, preparing to slap me, but just before I podvrtne feet and our hands are just missing.
Seběh Street Theatre provides an opportunity for a short rest and rozdýchání.
We are needed before us are the places where my views breathtaking.
A twist on Manes Bridge in Prague shows the whole beauty of the setting sun.
Not breathing, and my feet carry almost alone.
For the first refreshment comes the moment of truth.
Overrun road Katya škobrtne curb and performs jump plavmo.
I look to see if he needed help, and I run a series of encouraging words that had no time to think about the pain.
Rises and continue Goat aisle, it is one of the narrowest points of the track at this stage of the race, although it's not so crowded, but still need to observe good neighborhood.
I do not know that the term narrowest place gets its true significance later.
Powder Tower for us frantically encourage tourists and friends of the other runners.
I'm trying to clap with everyone who offers his hand, and my advice to Kate, because ten clap the fans is like half the energy bars.
It really works, we have picked up again and although we pretty much failed, now began to chase.
Outpacing dozens of runners, especially when I pass someone tired, I try to encourage him in a few words: "Come on, a little further, you can do it!"
Over the last refreshment nobody does not over us anymore, we are accelerating.
So far, we ran for an hour and a quarter, adding, no need to wait.
Three kilometers to the finish will hurt, but it is really needed máknout.
The sun had begun to set and ended the day slowly, symbolically ending the race.
The last run on the bridge and just sweep straight into the goal.
The pace at which we run, amazes me, where had the girl come from?
"Come on, let's go under thirteen hour, we're working!" I'm calling.
We're trying, sprints and there is a target.
Thirteen hour and six seconds.
Well, what I can do.
The coach entered the twenty-hour limit.
So seven minutes under the plan.
This is a super result.
Just aim for Kate buckling legs, helping her to the railing, where resting for a while.
It is to be seen depletion, but also good luck of dissipated power.
After a while I dispose of it slowly out of the target area.
Euphoria makes us think about the crush of passages to the locker rooms.
Here you can see the Goat Alley was not the narrowest point.
It is up here in order náplavka, which is under the onslaught of nearly ten thousand runners crowded to overflowing.
If someone does not like crowds, this is not the place for him.
And after a while I lose my head and wonder if those wonderful views compared to previous years and more interesting route stood for what is happening in the finish.
From my own experience I know that the organization of the race is not fun.
If one adds ten thousand people, a rich accompanying program and completion of the entire city center to all traffic, it is the major challenge.
This year's change of route runners showed many interesting places, but also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
Excellent atmosphere rozpumpovaná Yellow Spa is transferred between the runners and the race itself.
Organizers around the track, and bystanders they escalated every meter of track.
When running the historical center of the town, unfortunately, it must reckon with obstacles that can not be removed, but the goal of mass plant at the site, which is bordered on one side of the wall and on the river, I do not find the best solution.
If you say that the race finished racing goal, I evaluate it as very good.
For objective I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything turned out well.
Write to us in the discussion, even if the route you liked and what you say on the situation in goal.
Prison guards in Bulgaria are organizing protests
Hundreds of prison staff in Bulgaria participated in a nationwide protest rally in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital city Sofia.
On a peaceful demonstration reiterated their demand to reintroduce the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
On the list of requirements that have to be discussed with the interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov, as well as higher salaries.
Wardens month symbolically protesting against new working hours, and demanded a return to the original twenty-four hour shifts.
Although the prison guards unions and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they agreed to inform Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
"Negotiations are still ongoing," said the BNR chief of the Directorate General of the Prison Service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is expected that the protests prison staff also joins the members of the Federation of trade unions of employees at the Interior Ministry.
Why can have a multi-dimensional universe, and we can not see
Physicists generally do not write bestsellers, but Brian Greene of Columbia University in 1999 succeeded bull's eye.
His book The Elegant Universe became the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the thicket of problems, which now occupy many theoretical physicists - trying to unite two well-functioning, but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Universe's sleek doubt is that if finding a unified theory of physics is not a boring story.
Physicists fundamental problem between two key theories (after all, at this moment, our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and the suggested solutions solves so imaginative that it is worth retelling and laymen.
Greene is a complex material in addition counsel so fresh and engaging way that he can not be blamed much of interest in his books not included.
Additionally, his "mistake" largely remedied in the next two books: The structure of the Universe and The Hidden Reality.
Apparently neither the author would not object to it if his book has lamented faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years of Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential, what would an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years in this area, yet only slightly more lively (perhaps due to the fact that the LHC finally go "full throttle"), so it is a good time to enter the Green violently open door of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can have our universe?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions, certainly may sound silly, fantastic, strange or mystical.
Yet it is specific and quite acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn for a moment his eyes from the universe as a whole, something přízemnějšímu, particularly for long thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that hundred-meter garden hose upload from one side of the canyon to the other, watching the whole scene from a distance půlkilometrové (as in the picture, and on the next page).
From such a distance easily notice a long horizontally stretched hose, but if you just suffer from perspicacity, thick hose barely recognizable.
Due to their great distance from the hose, you'd think that the ant is forced to live on the hose has only one dimension, which may pass: left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant at the moment, his only one answer, stating: ant distances from the left (or right) end of the hose.
It all we want to say is that from a distance looks půlkilometrové long piece of pipe as one-dimensional object.
In the real world has a thick hose.
If all we enlarge, we see a sudden second dimension - in the shape of a circle dreamy hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is obvious that ant actually may move in two independent dimensions: the already well known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also the "dimension in / anti-clockwise", ie around kruhovéhoprůřezu hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant you have to enter two numbers: how far is it from the hose ends and where the circle dreamy hose.
This reflects the fact that the hose surface is two-dimensional (NB. The experts I notice that this chapter focuses solely on perturbative string theory.
Nonperturbative aspects discusses the 12th and 13th chapter.).
Hose surface is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is shown by the arrow straight, dimension in the circumferential direction, designated circular arrow, is short and coiled.
Between these two dimensions, however, it is a clear difference.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
Size dreamy circuit hose is short, "coiled" and less noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of the circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with significantly better resolution.
Mentioned example illustrates an important feature of the spatial dimension.
That they are divided into two groups.
They may be large, large, and therefore directly visible, or too little, furled and much harder observable.
Of course that in that case, we just nepředřeli to "convoluted" dimension dreamy thickness of tube uncovered.
It was enough to take the help of binoculars.
But if the hose was thinner - like hair or capillaries - coiled dimension we have discovered only with great effort.
Kaluza sent in 1919, Einstein his paper which came out with an amazing idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions known to us all.
Its radical assertion Kaluza justified by the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which to Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory weave into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately touted the question of how this goes Kaluzův observation together with the obvious fact that we're seeing it in three dimensions of space.
The answer you Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and he said clearly and clarify the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the assertion that the spatial geometry of the universe may have both large and curled dimensions.
This means that as well as dimensions along the length of the hose is also our universe is large, spacious and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which you are aware of every moment.
But the analogy with a circular perimeter of a garden hose may have additional space and dimension, tightly coiled in such a small space that previously remained hidden even from our most advanced experimental apparatuses.
To get a clearer idea about Kaluzova remarkable proposal, let us stay for a moment with a hose.
Imagine that circuit draw black hose fairly dense array of circles.
From a distance it looks like a thin tube is still one-dimensional line.
The telescope now through drawings reveal a folded dimension even easier, we'll see is motive in Figure 2.
We see clearly that the hose surface is two-dimensional, with one dimension of a large and almost limitless as other short and round.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but except for one small, circular dimension has three large spatial dimensions, altogether čtyřiprostorovédimenze.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
In order to help your imagination a little bit, let us note illustration in Figure 3; It shows two major dimensions and one small circular dimension.
Figure Sizing view of the geometry of the space similarly as we Increase magnification hose surface.
Each successive level represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (see the fourth level of magnification) when they are rolled into a small enough space; We explain that we are not yet directly observed.
The square grid shows the commonly known "large" dimensions, while a new circle, a tiny coiled dimension.
Just like loops of thread in a densely woven carpets, and these circles exist in every place of the usual size - just for clarity we plotted only to the intersections of the grid.
Background Figure 4 shows a commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such common scales, such as meters, depicted aside a small square in the grid.
On each of the following picture to focus on a small area of ​​the previous image; magnify it to become visible.
Initially, nothing unusual was happening, as seen in the first few levels of magnification.
But when they will pass on their way to the microscopic properties of the geometry of space further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - suddenly we see a new circle coiled into the shape of a dimension similar loops of thread in a tightly woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions, just as the hose has a circular perimeter at every point of its length.
In the interest of clarity, we plotted circular dimension only in certain, regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 Kalužová and Klein idea of ​​the microscopic structure of the geometry of space summarized.
Similarity with a hose is obvious, seeing as though important differences.
First, the universe has three large, sprawling far spatial dimensions (from which we have drawn only two), while the hose has only one big size.
Even more important difference lies in the fact that we're talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, rather than just about any object in the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly coiled extremely tiny dimensions, to recognize her - like a circular perimeter hose - much harder than watching apparent large and spacious dimensions.
If the size of the extra dimensions small enough to reveal it will, in fact, even beyond the power of our latest tools for zooming.
Most importantly, the additional dimension is not just a round protuberance within the normal size as a two-dimensional illustration erroneously suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension which exists at every point three ordinary large dimensions.
It is the dimension on the remaining three independent dimensions as well as the dimensions of top-down, left-right and front-back independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
Small enough ant could move in all four dimensions and to determine its position, we would need four figures, but three more usual position in the circular dimension; If we count time and then five data, in each case one more than we would normally expect.

Price for e-book is 149, - CZK.
To our surprise, therefore, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, shows Kalužová and Klein's thinking that this does not preclude the existence of additional dimensions curled when they are small enough.
Space can easily have more dimensions than can be seen with the naked eye.
How small should it be?
The most modern technical equipment can detect a billionth of a large structure billionth of a meter.
Less convoluted dimensions can hardly watch.
In 1926 Klein combined Kaluzův original idea with a few ideas from just being born of quantum mechanics.
The calculations suggested that the additional annular dimension could be approximately one Planck, therefore sizes far beyond the resolving power of today's devices.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Puddle-Klein theories.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises to practice on an electric guitar: Part 5
The whole essence of "Twelve" is based on twelve-harmonic form that can be repeated several times.
Who grope in music theory, finds its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
Education puppeteer and Puppeteers, whose Facebook profile can be viewed here, from school twenty years ago living as a graphic designer.
Is a guitarist Wohnout from which allegedly unfortunately, can not leave.
The guitarist's father, as a brother Matthew, a leader Wohnout.
With coaching start at one string.
"Rhythm is a model you can think of anything, just him then applied to harmonic twelve," says John.
When you add another string, you can figure again for a change.
Just listen and watch John, what can the dvanáctkovou harmonies on two strings to invent and how nicely he's starting to sound like.
If you gain the third string, you can flirt with a song melody.
And finally add the fourth, careful tuning change, warns Jack in the video.
Next time John returned to the pentatonic and try to put it together just a dozen or so.
So honestly exercise.
As best it can read in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school play the electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
On the big celebration it is, recognizes Hradec Dvorak
We take a point we are happy for him.
The first half we had more chances my second home, "he told striker, who this time scored from the penalty spot.
It was not fooling when nervous, after all, it was accompanied by a huge squeak?
I was terribly oblivious, even though the second goal, where home fans, it would probably be worse.
Penalty You have half an hour compared to, but you're also a goal from the penalty spot after he got less than four minutes.
What happened?
We slept beginning, we were passive, arose from the corner, and after him a penalty.
After you got up and the first half you were the better team, which had more chances.
Why has this changed after the break?
Hard to say.
I agree that we have a goal behind after playing well until the break.
In the cabin, we said that we want to keep up the pace after the game, but we could not.
Frankly, even I can not explain why.
But it is probably also true that a home on break something to the game said about her were not very happy.
On the pitch for the first time opponents have scored only while at home you still need to get even a goal.
Why is it such a difference?
I do not think it's such a difference, rather it depends on us how we will deal with it.
In Brno we started out well, but then it was bad from us, Pilsen, it's a different category.
Four matches have been waiting for a goal, did not you worried that after the last match can be similar?
This is perhaps not, but of course we are happy that the last game we do not talk about waiting for a goal to listen.
Now we have added another without waiting, but there are still only three in six games, which still is the big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from the crater kilometers away.
Lava flying particles on the surface of Holuhraun near a glacier Vatnajökull, flows underground tunnel kilometers away from the crater.
This is located under the glacier, as well as a portion of said underground lava tube.
This fact has scientists most worried about ...
The situation remains unchanged for now.
Since yesterday morning (8.31
2014) still blows out from a fissure about the same amount of lava.
Contrary to initial estimates, however, is the amount of less than 1000 m3 but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared with the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times greater.
Scientists fear, however, that the lava tube could open even in places where there is under the ice.
If that happened, with a similar effort that shows the current eruption, it would mean extensive flooding, both on the river Jökulsá á Fjöllum and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption smell a strong odor of sulfur from cracks rising clouds of steam and gases.
Definitely not a flare suitable for tourism, as was the case with Fimmvörðuháls eruption in 2010.
This is much bigger and there's a lot more gas, "says volcanologist Armann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, in the morning there was almost no wind in the area.
Traces of a sandstorm were washed away by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
Air traffic pays the orange level (the second highest) for Bárðarbunga and yellow (third) to Askja.
The sky over the town of Cheb was one of the brave Lady Peggy.
It walked on wings
Airshow in Cheb.
On the machine Boeing Stearman PT-17 was introduced air acrobat Peggy Walentinová that flight climbed out of the cockpit to the trapeze on the upper wing of a biplane and between the wings.
There is reliant solely on muscle power.
Airshow in Cheb was held this year for the fifth time and the organizers once again managed to prepare several interesting pieces of aircraft.
Premiere at the oldest Czech airport dismissed only "walking on wings" by the German acrobat Peggy Walentinové, but also the legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang aircraft Beechcraft 18th
He pulled himself to the attention of his brilliant coating.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking of US origin.
After the first World War and tried to push many former war pilots.
But due to the large number of fatalities was banned.
But now it is slowly returning to the program airshows.
Peggy after takeoff climbs out of the cockpit on the upper wing.
There shows different exercises.
At the end of the show moves into the space between the wings of the airplane where the show goes on, "said Ludek Matějíček of Cheb Ultralight Club and organizer of the airshow.
Pilot of a Boeing Stearman E 75 is her husband Friedrich.
If performance Peggy was the main highlight of the program, the following performance Mustang fighters were proverbial icing on the cake.
Legendary fighter on the desktop came with Grippens Czech Army in tow (called on numbers).
Such a report could air fans to see for the first time in the Czech Republic.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then all showed breathtaking aerobatic airplane from 1945.
He was made during the war, but probably she never attended.
He has been ranked in the Army Reserves.
From 1963 he worked in the civil sphere.
I like racing aircraft.
Today has its home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradiste.
On the same site there is also another pearl Cheb airshow, twin-engine Beechcraft Expeditor C45H.
At the airport, a giant engine did not go overlooked.
His polished aluminum cover shone into the distance.
He won the admiration and machine Max Holste MH 1521 Broussard in the colors of the French Air Force.
Small airliner aback for a renunciation Turbolet and German Hofu has brought a part of the German delegation at an airshow.
German neighbors in Cheb performed with restored aircraft as 18T or formations of three biplane Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhyová: Dramatic comeback in front of the camera!
Parental worries exchanged Lucie Borhyová least for tonight for the work.
Stress or nervousness - blonde presenter nothing that obviously does not know.
Moderating the TV news there and it went well, as if with him for two months did not stop at all!
Yet it is only two weeks, as the blonde ended confinement, during which experienced postpartum women the greatest stress.
Lucie But the main news program Nova TV show will still periodically.
Regular awaits her return, according to information Blesk.cz up to a month.
After all, by her daughter, Linda needs now more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhyová returned to the television screen and it was a bull's eye.
Exhibitions per year in Prague?
The hall would be sold out, planned bachelor party Jagr
It would be a decent, if something like this did during the World Cup.
But it depends how to build a union, "he said in Jihlava after the exhibition entitled Gold game in which reconvened breathtaking Nagano team.
Even players who participated in the golden hat-trick.
Players should have a taste that?
Definitely.
It would just be good to make a farewell to the golden generation during the championships.
I think we can find one tournament during two days when it is completely free and where one could match such a blend.
We say that linings (Jiri Slegr) or lamenting Ščerbanovi (Jihlava match organizer), who would take care of it ...
Arena would be sold out.
But what if you play with the New Jersey playoffs?
So that when I arrive ...
Playing in the national team but you do not.
Jihlava meetings or somehow altered your decision?
Representation and exhibition match are two different things and representation are critical performances.
One thing is that I would love to see the people there, but the performances are crucial, especially for the World Cup.
There should drive the players who can do it, and not because they have a good reputation.
My decision was not changed.
How did you actually enjoyed it Nagano reunion?
Just a meeting with the players was great.
One animated stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans but also for our hockey team.
However, the most important was a tribute to Ivan Hlinka.
And it's good to remind our history of hockey and that leaves one generation, that we really wanted.
Slavomir Lener, Vladimir Ruzicka and Peter Čechmánek on the bench.
You himself still recall his first national team match?
Such things are not forgotten.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young: I, Robert Holik and Robert Reichel, we boarded one of three.
For all it was the first ceremonial start.
Well, we somehow dominated, so it is impossible to say.
In Jihlava after a long time catching Dominik Hasek.
What did you say his performance?
Hasan me on the ice never surprise.
I wanted him to come back with the criticism, but I can not (Hasek criticized Jagr as reasons why he decided to quit the national team) .Zachytal just fine.
I Hnilička great skill.
While he was with me one night to train and there was děravej.
And now famously caught.
At first the US and then the Netherlands, footballers qualification begins
To Smíchov NH Hotel on Monday morning descended prominent guests.
People need to be able to catch a glimpse of goalkeeper Petr Cech of Chelsea, national coach Pavel Vrba ...
And there, the figure in a black baseball cap, it is Tomas Rosicky!
Arsenal midfielder and national team captain arrived at the event around eleven thirty last.
There will be a nice match against the Netherlands.
Who would be looking forward to? "He said, already in the national team kit appeared before journalists.
Program Czech national team
Monday, September 1: Beginning the meeting, the first practice
Tuesday, September 2: Training is open to fans (18:30 Letná) Autograph (20:00)
Wednesday, September 3 Czech - USA (20:15 Letná)
Tuesday, September 9th Czech - Netherlands (20:45 Letna) end meeting
Rosicky et al. fans can encourage even before Wednesday's game against the USA (20:15).
Representation for them is opened Tuesday's practice, which begins at Letna at 18:30.
And it will be followed by an autograph session at which neither Czech Rosicky will miss.
Otherwise, however, this meeting will be the national team quieter.
Which praised the coach Vrba, who had just on a number of social events in the spring he complained.
Finally, we will deal with it, what we want to pursue.
Now we will focus on the Netherlands.
It is an advantage when you have players together eight days.
We'll have time to rehearse things that until now was not much time, "claimed Vrba, who officially led the national team since January.
Czech national football team will be at the entrance to the new qualifying cycle accompany Musketeers image.
Vrbou under representation has had three fights, all the preparation.
In Norway and Finland tied 2: 2 and Austria lost 1: 2nd
These results, however, were still important.
It now.
The game starts with the Netherlands because of the qualification process for the European Championship 2016.
Czech team would obviously help if managed well rehearsal against USA.
The first half was that we met.
Now it is important results.
We need to think that we were successful, "said Vrba.
The only player třiadvacetičlenné nomination, who has health problems, the striker David Lafata.
Temperature bothering him.
If it was too late to recover Wednesday's game against the USA, coach Vrba should have called one attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
Wife of Britain describes how, after many years of misdiagnosis thought she would die.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of adolescence, thinking that she has left only a few years of life.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
CMT UK charity said it is misdiagnosed among people with CMT common problem, because the disease is known to very few.
It is understood that the UK is suffering from CMT approximately 23,000 people, which can manifest itself in motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, clumsy gait and twisted toes.
In affected may also experience numbness or pain, this condition is incurable and progressive, meaning that over time, the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreichovou ataxia (FA) - a disease which has a poor prognosis.
She believed that before celebrating the eighteenth birthday, is confined to a wheelchair and was dead before her thirty.
Mother of two children, now 51, says: "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same things as everyone else.
Every day I dropped everything and took me longer.
I never could with other kids roller skate or skateboard, and I bullied at school because of the way I walked and ran. "
Rodgers when he was thirteen, and after several operations, which had to release her Achilles tendon and straighten the foot, took advantage of her doctor left the room and looked in his dossier, where she learned that suffer from FA.
"I felt guilty because I stalker, so I have not told anyone, but when I returned home, I sought information about the disease in the library and I wrote to the Association FA," he says.
When I answered, I was in shock, I completely panicked.
I thought before I turn eighteen, I end up in a wheelchair, and before I'm twenty-five, I'll be dead, and meanwhile gradually lose all their skills.
I was all alone and I planned a funeral. "
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk will not deteriorate as much as expected, and asked it to their surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her and said, "Honey, I do not think the disease you have, otherwise you would have been in a wheelchair.
I think it will be something far less life-threatening. "
After passing several genetic tests revealed that he has CMT.
"When I explained what CMT is, I thought that I was a child of fortune," she said.
CMT UK charity has launched awareness of CMT month to draw attention to this disease.
Entrepreneurs in Washington: a turn of the economy, rising taxes
Growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey, which was published last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country with the acceleration of economic recovery last year increased slightly and firms in Washington was no exception.
Businesses in Maryland and Virginia together for the fiscal year 2013 to state and local treasuries did $ 27.6 billion, which is 3.8% higher than the amount of $ 26.6 billion collected in 2012.
Tax burden - state and local - last year rose by 4.3% to $ 671 billion, compared with 3.9% last year and this was the third consecutive year of growth after 2009 and 2010, when taxes decrease.
According to a study conducted by a professional firm Ernst & Young and political grouping Center on State Taxation, state taxes grew faster, by 4.3%, non-local contributions, by 3.9%.
More than half of the tax revenue the district, 56% of the business tax, and 36% of revenue is from Maryland companies.
Virginia, with 28%, has the smallest proportion to tax business income.
The researchers say the majority share gains in tax revenue comes from the increase in value of property belonging to companies which property taxes this year after three consecutive years of growth -1% increased by 3.7%.
Although most of the profit comes from large states like California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same situation is also in Washington.
Companies in the DC, Maryland and Vriginii last year paid over ten billion dollars to state and local taxes on real estate, compared with 9.6 billion in 2012, representing an annual increase of 4.2%.
The apparent increase in property values ​​but does not force many top state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the property tax represents less than a fifth of company taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C. is a tax on real estate for nearly half of state and local taxation.
"In Maryland, own a lot of real estate companies, especially tax base near DC, government or non-profit organizations that do not pay taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, income taxes, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from the business can not be only attributed the healing to the property market.
According to the data, it appears that business income will also increase.
Firms in the region have published the income tax Corporate $ 2.3 billion, which increased from 2.1 billion in the year 2012.
Maryland income tax corporate chose one billion dollars, the highest in the region.
Although moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses grow in these three places as quickly.
The growth rate in D.C. It was at the level of the national average, at 4.3%, while growth in Maryland was markedly higher, 4.9%.
Virginia was the only tax increase below average at 4.1%.
Virginia has all three districts (all of which have the same taxation) the lowest taxation of companies, 6%.
The rate of company taxation in Maryland is 8.25%, while the average DC remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the American Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has a lower state and local taxes and the overall favorable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. the study did not evaluate.
Despite this advantage Virginia facing competitive pressures from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing the corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax is reduced to 5%.
If you will stand in the coming year continue to meet revenue targets, it could be in 2017, the statutory income tax rate decreased to 3%.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington doing better, and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
Trade tax levied by small businesses as a tax on personal income - the structure of the compensation cost increases by raising prices, which is organized by most firms - in DC, Maryland and Virginia rose last year by 20% to $ 2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers say that trend and nationwide business tax increases are likely to continue next year, overall tax revenue from sales to state and local governments, compared to the same period last year, the first three quarters of 2014 increased to 6.2%.
Washington, however, may lag behind the others because of the reduction in governmental spending takes its toll on the labor market.

Family Joan Rivers: "Good luck"
Joan Rivers is in a coma three days, from the moment she arrived at the hospital in New York City, but her daughter is now expressed that loses hope that he recovers jednaosmdesátiletá comedian.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," said Melissa Rivers in a statement today.
Keeping her fingers crossed.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call for an ambulance, according to which, she had a cardiac arrest on yorkwillské endoscopy in the Upper East Side, as the source said.
Doctors deliberately maintain her under sedation and under strict supervision, until they are not sure of her condition, which remains "serious."
Reactions were not long to wait, including unreal Internet support from celebrities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
The reality is fudging subtitles
Media headlines that distort their reality is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know that the headlines "sell" newspaper, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who do not read anything else.
And it is a fact that makes me very worried lately, is more apt word bugging.
This concerns in particular articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Quite common are the headlines "Israel attack on Gaza."
Only text you will read that the Israeli "attack" was a response to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time announced a truce.
It will then appear in the caption "Both sides have violated the ceasefire."
Recognizes the journalism community, thus a directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that throughout Europe (and not only there) are rising?
Less than sixty years since the end of WW2.
Still living survivors of the Shoah.
When I saw the video of the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted slogan "Jewish swine" and similar zhůvěřilosti, zatrnulo me.
It wants the world to complete what Hitler went wrong?
Our journalists are aware of the fact that after the Jews were destined for disposal Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen journalists, please take a little more care of their job.
You often labeled as "watchdogs of democracy".
So her Advocate.
As long as there is.
A Advocate also the right one truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like to preserve our government, if any of our neighbors decided to liquidate Czech nation and Czech Republic erased from the map?
Perhaps you should also remember one more fact.
On the territory of the State of Israel lived for almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship.
And it is well there.
If you ask them why they do not go between "their" need to Gaza, replies you, why would they do that?
In Israel they work, social security and cutting-edge health care (myself with my own eyes she saw the top private hospital Hadassah, which is funded by sponsorship donations from Jews around the world, commonly frequented by Arabs and there are obviously treated).
Hamas for its missile attacks on their Arab brothers.
The only real assistance to Gaza, and thus this unstable region is to deprive it of Hamas and disarm him.
And do not condemn Israel, even indirectly in the headlines.
Inform the practices of Hamas, his abuse of people as human shields.
Tell that Hamas seeks to liquidate the State of Israel, not at any price.
Even at the cost of death of innocent Arab children.
Tell that Hamas is on the list of global terrorist organizations.
Tell that after nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could be booming thanks to humanitarian aid around the world.
Even from Israel, where water and electricity supplies, for which, however, does not apply Gaza administrators and even angry that they are at this time occasionally interrupted power supply.
If Hamas did not invest money in the construction of underground tunnels so that they could penetrate suicide bombers in Israel, but maybe in the construction of residential buildings, hospitals and schools, lived by his Arab brothers in Gaza much better.
Amazon bought for $ 1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON has just confirmed allegations of Information Monday morning: Internet Retailer - producer of videos and hundreds of other things - bought for $ 1.04 billion ($ 970 million), video streaming service Twitch.
Announcement caused surprise not because nobody would expect that someone will buy Twitch, but because it was expected that the buyer will be YouTube.
Three months ago, he looked sale Twitch Google for a billion confident, and this seemed like a natural connection.
Twitch, who three years ago founded Justin.tv, she was poised to become widely used video streaming services - the live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players to broadcast it online broadcasts of the games - the words Business Insider "YouTube for playing live traffic."
Interaface Twitch.
YouTube is already popular video "Let's play" type, where pundits (mostly older) plays a processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube is coming when popisuTwitche broached a lot, so the news that YouTube kupujeTwitch, nobody much mind at all, it was a textbook example of how an established company will pay a possible competition.
The puzzle is why an agreement with YouTube came out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as the Amazon.
Everything that we currently have available, the statement Twitch CEO Emmett Shear: "We chose the Amazon because they believe in our company, has the same values ​​and long-term vision and wants to help us accomplish it faster."
Another mystery is - frankly - an incredible achievement Twitch.
For snobs like myself who argue that sport rather do than watch, it is difficult to understand what is so amazing at how real games instead of playing just watch.
One thing is to look at three in the morning my friend over his shoulder playing Resident Evil, and another thing altogether to watch someone else to get twenty hits to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games in which you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today, the most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so look at their record, without having to self-control perspective, it is a pretty good recipe to get a hemlock.
Granted, the game type speed run, in which Roger Bannister our electronic time finishes the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone is not playing or master of humor, his channel on Twitch will probably not be very interesting.
But what about the skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is fourth on the top Internet traffic.
How exactly that Amazon uses?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch mixed into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as if it could have been swallowed by YouTube.
Twitch but has something she would like to draw any firm: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As the director told Twitch Shear, Amazon and Twitch "believes in the future of gaming" and the media do not seem to be reluctant, even as - gulp - viewers.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of an American atheist vlogger Aaron Ra.
This year on "The holy scriptures are the word of God."
Accompanied the original video.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers are discussing one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they often confront the question: Who will you believe?
Alleged word of God, or the word of a man?
As if the human exploration was quite paltry in comparison with authority what they imagine is their doctrine.
But when they say "man", talking about science.
And when you refer to the "word of God", refer to the myths about God entered human beings.
If there is indeed an intelligent creator with a purpose to, then it is he who created the fossil record, which reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who added another row evidence showing exclusively to evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things existed?
It seems as if we tried to say something!
People could not build any of those things.
But people can tell stories fabulovat.
And these were people who wrote all the lyrics that pretends to be the word of God.
Each supposedly sacred teachings of any religion in the world describes itself as written by people, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" their favorite gods, or perhaps listen to the dictates of angels, but the lyrics were written by none other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If indeed there was a real god, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, über-galactic supergénius, the ultimate entity of the cosmos.
If a creature of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could not work with such a measure.
And people should not have blindly trusted her because it would be consistent, truthful and substantiated by verifiable evidence, and appeared to be deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would inspire every reader to the unity of the common faith.
If God wrote it, we would not expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion, leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without a common origin and all are constantly disintegrate into increasingly separate denomination, looking questionable truths and each somehow claiming divine guidance, regardless of the continuing divergence and separation in each direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'lláhův Kitab-i-Akdas Zarathustra's Avesta, Adi-Granth Sikh, Mahabharátská and Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, and the book Urantia are all considered "absolute truth" and "revealed Word of the one true God "and their respective believers each of them say that the others are astray.
The only logical explanation is probably that they are misled to a certain extent everyone.
None of the above books has no advantage over the other.
None of them has any evidentiary support and are not historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I am a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I'm not saying I proved that the Bible is historically accurate and reliable.
Of course, it is not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and apologetics (defense), because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered to be true, which have already been overcome.
So you can not say they are a proof of divine wisdom.
Many of these advocates nefarious atrocities rather than morality, and many of them claim to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of the prophecy - that each well can contain prophecies that were not fulfilled.
Front theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and therefore are subject to interpretations, perceptions and perspectives of their primitive prejudices and often tied politically motivated authors to explain many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I would not call it a contradiction, but rather mutual comments.
We must again point out that there are two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revisions.
It is right that Genesis has more than one author, and is certainly not telling Eyewitness!
Some experts now have four different resources only for the Pentateuch, ie. The five books of "Moses" and Moses ascribe authorship of any of them, because they almost certainly did not exist, as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezra) of several mutually unrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not a coincidence as old as her faithful mind.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological discoveries of texts known for his unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic faiths, and yet many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, druidic cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by docetaxel and Ebionite and their very different views on Jesus that will eventually combine in a sort of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups like the Luciferian were scattered and discredited further revisions Bible.
One of these arrangements apply to Ugarit king, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because of his followers constituted a major threat to young mojžíšké religion, the authors of the New Testament have decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebul, "Lord on the Mountain" was changed to Beelzebub "Lord of the Flies."
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently as amended by the religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Testament were canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of commission decisions on the council of Nicaea.
The four Gospels was adopted and sixteen others were rejected by simply raising a hand, as if the fact some things she accept or reject the ballot.
The way the canon evolved depended on what he read on Sundays in the then Christian centers.
What we read on the second Sunday after Easter in Jerusalem Church?
And what about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they realized that approaches these same evangelical stories.
Thus, the core canon thus evolved from the conventional wisdom of the early church.
So the council simply accepted as gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at that time.
But equally knowingly took more than ten books of the Bible, even if they reported the books that were approved.
Declined items can be found among the writings of both apostles and prophets.
Why would God's word should refer to books that are just words, any people and / or no longer available?
Who's the real editor?
The Bible often mentions the human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God was the real author of this haphazard jumble of legends, parables and Psalm lyric?
The Bible was written by people surely and definitely not too enlightenments, quite the contrary!
That is the reason why so much of its content historically and scientifically absolutely wrong, whether it's about almost anything, from beginning to end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys can talk, believe in spells, blood sacrifices, ritual magic, enchanted items, fiery potions, astrology and the five elements of magic.
They thought that he used a magic wand which someone sprayed blood will cure him of leprosy.
We are talking about people who thought that rabbits are ruminants, birds and bats and whales are fish that pi is an integer.
These people believed that when a pregnant cow show striped patterns, striped bear calves.
How would this tell anybody who knows anything about genetics?
The authors of this book, it obviously did not.
If the Bible was written by some higher being, then it will not contain such errors, what it contains.
If it came from the pen of truly superior beings, and was intended as literal history, then it contained nothing of what it contains.
As a moral guide totally fails because most of the original Hebrew writings were written bigoted and ignorant savages who had overlooked or supporting cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slaves abuse, family abuse, child abuse, violence against children, abortions, looting, murder , cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
Inhumanity to defend his assertion that they are doing God's will.
However, creationists continue to ignore all this.
Some of their Web sites admit that if there is any reality in conflict with the Bible, then it must be a fact ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists had his beloved books, they should not even God.
Their world is one and the same second.
Ironically, they reject God's "work" as "worship the creature rather than the Creator."
But they regarded the word of man as the word of God and God alone and even insist that refute their supposedly "holy" books somehow disproves God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They can not accept that God could exist and be concurrently Bible could be wrong, because they can not separate from the doctrine of the deity.
So it's kind of idolatry, where the faithful worship man-made compilations, as if these books were God himself, because he thinks they are his words.
But God never written or dictated not from the writings of any religion.
Everything people approved or rejected in their supposedly "immutable words" any god, was fabricated, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified and often deliberately altering and spin just fallible human beings.

Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, became a public document nude pictures of celebrities
Screenshot of a dump of leaked files
Meanwhile anonymous 4chan server publishes nude or pornographic images of American celebrities, pointed out that the American server Mashable.com.
He is reportedly gained unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple's servers, where it is impaired users uploaded through an automated backup images from the iPhone and iPad.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.

Smart way to save for college textbooks
Given that the cost of university textbooks for many students is over $ 1,000 a year, came upcoming sophomore with a clever way to cut costs.
Devised a system of borrowing books from classmates of the higher grades med nominal compensation, to delay the sale of their back.
"The book on calculations that normally costs $ 180, I got ten semester and chicken nuggets," said Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Books required in his last semester would cost $ 430, he says.
He spent 120th
According to the university council spends an average student for textbooks and supplies more than $ 1,200 a year, but students have different options to manage those expenses.
The preferred choice of students are becoming Internet business and creative solutions like that Schroeder.
Also on the rise is lending textbooks, which allows students to use the term book and often at a significant discount than if they buy it.
Neeb Inc engaged in more than 250 campus bookstores in saying that borrowing books from 2011 doubled.
The recent survey shows that around a quarter of books in university bookstores were last spring semester borrowed, vice president Neeb says Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of textbooks, according to the National Association of university shops in university bookstores buys.
Here's the 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
Prices of some new books on the Internet may be up to a third lower than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $ 290, but on the Internet it is possible to Chegg.com in retailing specialized textbooks purchased new for $ 239.99.
Buy used
If you do not mind other people's comments or wear and damage, the appropriate options are used textbooks.
Chegg.com on the "Calculus" sells for $ 93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, the junior at Brigham Young University, says that Amazon.com has paid for the used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" 42 cents.
New sold for $ 48.
University lecturer Ingrid Braceyová, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls suggests that students with their teachers confirm whether it is acceptable to the older edition.
Sometimes the changes are not for the substantial work in seminars.
If so, can the older editions sell for a fraction of the final version.
In addition Chegga and Amazon, are a popular alternative to buying used books also eBay Inc.'s Half.com.
Loan
Also worth considering borrowing textbooks, if you treat them well, forgetting to bring back and you do not need to have even after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost for a new book.
For example, a student would have to borrow the entire semester, "Calculus" for about twenty dollars.
Familiarize yourself with the terms of trade, in which a book borrowing, including sanctions for notes, highlighting or wear and tear.
Keep in mind: If you return a book on time, the penalty may be higher than the price of new books.
E-books
Another option is to obtain books instead of the normal e-book.
Sometimes these books essentially lend in the form of electronic licenses valid for a period of time from distributors like Amazon.com, Chegga and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegga borrows "Calculus" to six months for about $ 61.
According Braceyové so you can find the best bargain among students of literature courses, because many of the classics is now available for free download, while the scientific and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, walk around the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon board a Pepperdine Law School, advised to follow the ISBN, because it ensures that you are buying the right book.
Before you order a book over the Internet, make sure that it is really in stock, advises Gault.
Convinced about it firsthand.
The book, which he had bought, was sold out for four weeks, and had to pay full price for a book from the university bookstore.

And then they found the well torso rifles from the war
Well worth the short walk from the church. George.
We uncovered stand around and started pulling aged deposition - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
When we approached the clayey bottom, we ran into a barrel, 'said Radomil Novak.
We pulled it cleaned and found that it is a fragment of a German assault rifles, used by the SS.
The finding is reported to be uncommon.
According to my information, these rifles produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand dollars, "said Novak.
All wood construction with things decayed over time, so it is useless.
Her body, however, is preserved - holds its shape.
How in the well found themselves?
One explanation exists.
Maybe they threw people there who wanted to get rid of the weapons used by the SS, probably out of fear of being expelled.
Fascists on the run would probably do that.
They threw their arms in the woods, "said finder.
The rifle was the only thing fans of the Rainbow Movement Mountains found in the well.
"Could there be a hand grenade, those that had been around a lot, so we slowed down excavation work, we carefully probed the mud in order to avoid any unhappiness, but nothing else down there was not," explained Smith.
Finding ends in the depository of the museum at the castle in the nearby village of Silesian Rudoltice.

Ukrainian soldiers liberation from captivity pro-Russian separatists dedicated around the clock.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that on the side of pro-Russian separatists are fighting the Czechs.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to thirty.
However, there may be even more.
Have you with a Czech prisoner encountered during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: He liberated've already captured Serbs, Dagestanis, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians ... but Cech not yet.
But I know who to contact in Prague when we came across your captured countryman and could rescue him.
Ukrainian soldier captured separatists
A.cz: What is your advice to the Czechs, who were added to the pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers are captured?
They should understand that if you like the Czechs fighting in the Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and separatists is captured, and after questioning shoot without mercy, just like any other foreigner.
Separatists consider these men as mercenaries and according to them they have nothing to deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers captured a group of separatists doněckých - and between them was even Cech - and he sits behind bars, and treat him as a prisoner of war.
The guy simply survive.
The Ukrainian side behaves in the war as a state.
A.cz: And how much do you have managed to save Ukrainian prisoners?
I understand and exchange.
Some sources state that had long since crossed the hundred men.
We long ago stopped counting how many people we have helped.
But we just rescued ... rescued before the war, if they decide to continue fighting.
Rescuers are at war physicians, surgeons, but we certainly do not.
That's it.
A growing daily, and more.
Every day we rescue someone.
Sometimes one, sometimes five or foursome.
And it does not always go to the exchange.
Sometimes just for the release of prisoners as a mere human entreaty.
A.cz: Word is that you have a few months of pro-Russian separatists won with great authority and confidence ... even as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect from both sides?
Difficult question.
One of the officers in Kyiv gave me the nickname "Mad general with steel spheres."
It does not offend me.
And perhaps it also captures the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian officer corps, I have some authority acquired earlier.
Never nechytračím, cheating and always keep my word.
Whatever's going on, so I act honorably and speak the truth.
Even if it is the Ukrainian government, or the Donets and Luhansk very uncomfortable.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply say that it is torture and kill.
And they are crimes.
Often while risking his life, even when I was captured as a prisoner exchange ... this works for me may at any time be the end ... I do not have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and torture of prisoners know?
... (Long pause) ... torture prisoners during interrogations resort Ukrainians and separatists.
Unfortunately.
A executions?
They take place only at the Donetsk side.
The fact that the Ukrainian military also executes prisoners have no information.
Even indications that the Ukrainian army something like committing.
The number of executions we have an idea, but I can not specify the numbers and do not want.
A.cz: Tell me about the characters and motives of pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They strive for independence and perhaps even democracy in Donetsk and Luhansk - at least they say so.
They do not want to play no more games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
Separatists have already fed up with the oligarchs and their implacable opponents - on life and death.
As we say - we are eaten them up to the neck.
The same dreams and aspirations of people gave casually revealed on Majdan.
And now a little zaspekuluji: Russia supports the separatists and vice versa West Ukrainian state.
One speculation consider the other big and small, on the contrary.
Already this my sentence but conceals irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: How do you, for example, appears to be one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists Igor Bezler?
Whenever war front crossed the line, I am unarmed and show soldiers or militants outstretched bare hands.
And they always have both sides of the two hundred or three hundred meters at gunpoint or in the optical sight.
The faces of people pointing at me every time I see ... well, and they can always pull the trigger of his gun.
Paratrooper, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
Regarded as a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just as a small province in the great Russian empire.
In any event, he is constantly talking and Ukraine is considered as a kind of misunderstanding arising.
Such a state would, according to him did not even exist.
It is the implacable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - the Ukrainian television discussion show you your prime minister Arsenije Jaceňuka described as a weak, helpless and weary "leader" who would do best if they left quickly.
During those three hundred meters walk always get at least five times fear.
Why should I therefore conceal the view that Jaceňuk is very weak prime minister and that is harmful to our country?
A.cz: do you think the share of war in Ukraine?
You may know that Ukrainians Jaceňuka nicknamed "Rabbit".
A rabbit is not in the eyes of Ukrainians animal from which it would be intimidating or should for other respect and authority.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
Maybe it is a good economist, but as a prime minister has the right to cry in the war in parliament, begging him, play with him the intrigues threatening to put the function ... he must manage the land, manage it, and in time of war and protect.
When threat to the country is not entitled to the Prime Minister on family, friends, relaxing on a tearful emotion.
He's a first of Ministers of Ukraine.
A Jaceňuk?
He behaves like a teenage girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak because it has never been strong ... do not fight for Ukraine, just constantly complains about everything.
It should therefore leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.

According to some commentators may be to blame a change in the approach of viewers and increased popularity of websites like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on the Disney processing Jungle Book, The Hollywood Reporter's Web site said: "I think that times are changing."

Now 23 year old forvard could decide in the two biggest chances but failed.
After a goal called mainly shot close-up three minutes before the end, instead of the network but closed on keepers Josef Opava Květoň.
I had it on her leg, I have to give such chances.
On myself, I was angry, "Vasicek sprinkled ashes on his head.
"Maybe I should give up under the lid, slid a bit to me," he mused.
Sigma defensive power of Opava let exception was Mikulův raid on 11 minutes, but it covered the goalie Reichl.
Then they began to push Hanáci, some chances but the defending unit did not let the home and missiles from afar He caught Květoň.
Fifteen minutes we compared, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.

Al Pacino twice excited Venice.
Film festival otherwise in crisis
After the huge excitement over opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iñárritu suddenly ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next day suggested the impression that interest in the 71st edition of the Venice Film Festival somewhat subsided.
Whether because of the number of seats in the largest hall rose to fourteen hundred, or because of criticism followed after Birdman recognized, but less attractive to viewers images as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia 60s gaze of silence and other films with social themes, from US 99 homes after the Iranian Stories, cinemas simply remained empty seats.
Heroes comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace neobléhaly no such crowds as in the past, and reportedly ceased to be difficult to find a last-minute place in the hotel.
The crisis talks in Italy more than anywhere else and it is no wonder that affected even so esteemed institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not show a lack of personalities present, but only in the context of the film.
While younger fans eager for autographs representatives of comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who at 99 homes quite successfully acquitted dramatic roles, for all generations, without distinction became the main event of the visit of the legendary actor Al Pacino.
In addition, there shone in two films.
The lucidity of the story as presented out of competition, who made the Oscar-winning Barry Levison novel by Philip Roth, has čtyřiasedmdesátiletý role Pacino, who are close to him: the actor of glory who is depressed from the end of their careers and personal lives.
But to see him the next day as the eccentric owner of a hardware store from a rural town in the movie Manglehorn, whom made David Gordon Green, it was a truly memorable experience.
Volpi Cup for Best Actress should not miss him - but he still needed an artist Pacinova format in prices?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him the love of the audience, and especially the Italian, as though he was born in New York, reports the Al Pacino proudly to the country they come from his grandparents.
Points for Italy
Indeed, the Italian film this year leads in Venice very well.
Black Soul, directed by Francesco Munzi, occurred after the first frame, Birdman has received a long standing ovation.
Calabrian mafia offshoot is it seen by looking at the relationships between family clans that are fighting each other for power and money, and the director was able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good movie: a quality screenplay, cinematography, music and actors.
Chamber also took psychothriller Hungry Hearts, who made Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacherovou in the role of a woman that his misguided fussiness nearly kills her own child.
In contrast, the French films in competition there was no warm welcome for Ransom nor glory, nor three hearts, two works by adhering to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But then, two really excellent films, ie Birdman and black soul, not for the first half of the festival so little.
And although the festival films are mostly depressive themes, new image of Peter Bogdanovich called She's Funny That Way, witty comedy specified in Venice out of competition and filmed in the style of American comedies of the '40s, managed to elevate the mood for more than one day.

Last week placed a victory proponents of Scottish Independence at your fingertips
Campaign for Scottish independence was in danger, that this mistake makes the third time when he nearly placed on billboards throughout Scotland question whether they want to be rich Scots.
But the hearts of Scottish voters will not get the fact that you appeal to their wallet, nor do not get their respect when they begin to threaten.
New Testament morality is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to expel the money changers out of the temple, than to let them dictate how they vote.
Scottish nationalists boss Alex Salmond knows this, and therefore in a television debate repeatedly asked his rival unionist Darling, whether it is willing to respect "the sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence and begin to support the single currency and for Scotland for England.
Darling's forced to elect between the Scottish civil society and London financiers, as grimace fell into this trap.
Of course, that Darling will not support the mandate of Scottish voters.
However, the debate about what will be the currency of Scotland, was already more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, jobs and the defense of public health care to citizens free of charge.
Darling in the matter of currency backed London banker, and also caused the impression that it would not protest against the privatization of health care.
As Salmond said, "he climbed into bed with the Conservatives."
This is for anyone of Scottish politics very dangerous position.
Each Scottish voter knows that the Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with the Conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland, not the voters, but the association "bosses", the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to discuss independence, Prime Minister Salmond Scottish Unionist campaign was for a serious mistake.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee home.
Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron least able to say that Scotland can become a "successful independent countries."
Alistair Darling could not say anything like that, has him almost physical pain.
What he conveys is clear: Scots do not have to jump up and accept what is.

Putin asks Kiev to the eastern Ukraine launched negotiations on "national sovereignty"
According to the description of events by Russian newspapers on Sunday he asked Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Ukrainian government to stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately launched negotiations on "national sovereignty" breakaway regions.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained his remark that Putin did not intend to imply that region of eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be revised to Russian-speaking region got the power to protect their rights and interests.
Putin's challenge Kiev's government to negotiate with the pro-Russian rebels as equals, corresponds to the obvious strategy, which is governed by the outbreak of riots five months ago: Help separatists occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government recently announced Novorusku grant virtual independence to the place with the West could unite with Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of the state television, Putin denounced the Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern region of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which in March and April separatists took over after the March 18 Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently occupied territories labeled as "Novorusko" or "New Russia", a term that refers to a famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian empire.
Russian news agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words, according to which "a prisoner illusion" anyone who believes they are on the horizon for peace negotiations because Ukrainian politicians started before the parliamentary elections on October 26 campaigns, while government troops attacking civilians in areas controlled by Separatists.
"In the interest of people living in these areas must promptly initiate meaningful negotiations and not merely on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the Statute of the national sovereignty of the south-east of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's allusion to statehood had been considered in the broader context of autonomy, which he shared with the leadership of Kyiv is already several months and which has mitigated concerns about Russian-speaking regions of the threat to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that the necessary autonomy eastern areas may be granted only by the Ukrainian government.
It is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because there is a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but Ukrainian internal conflict."
Kremlin spokesman intervention, which should correct the "wrong interpretation" of Putin's remarks, stressed Russia's access management solutions to the insurgency by separatists in the east, which is different from the open cast Crimea, where most of the two million population ethnic origin among the Russians.
Moscow would have had much more difficulty and annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are Russians and the polls that were held before the conflict, have shown broad support for staying in Ukraine.
Autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums, the regional governments of Ukraine gave the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and essentially give the Kremlin's de facto control over the territory that would combine the Russian mainland to the Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago, it is the headquarters of a major Russian naval fleet, maritime commercial background and historical coastal resorts.
Russia's Rostov region and the Crimea are also a center down factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko during his inauguration speech on 7 June suggested that Ukrainian lawmakers - for new elections - to consider changes to the constitution that would have given the diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
This vision of autonomy they differ markedly from the vision of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's recent call to Kiev dealings with separatists as equals, followed the next steps rebels last week after Eastern Ukraine penetrated Russian troops and tanks from the previously quiet areas along the Sea of ​​Azov.
Separatists boosted the Russians took control of Novoazovsk such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to take strategic coastal territory up to the Crimea.
That precipitated a massive civilian and military effort to fortify the Mariupol port with metallurgical integrated plants 500 000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk a narrow gateway on the Crimean peninsula.
Porošenko Saturday spoke at a meeting of leaders of the European Union in Brussels and urged for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that is independent of the past 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return," warned Porošenko.
On the territory of Ukraine is now in thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks.
EU summit did not take any definitive action - leaders called for further sanctions against Russia for unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council on Saturday told reporters in Kiev that Ukrainian troops were forced to retreat from their positions in Illovaisk after last week's two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops penetrated the Donetsk region to support the beleaguered separatists.
The first of the 63 reported by Ukrainian soldiers, who were captured in Illovaisk during the Russian invasion, were on Sunday exchanged for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, he said on Sunday Lysenko.
