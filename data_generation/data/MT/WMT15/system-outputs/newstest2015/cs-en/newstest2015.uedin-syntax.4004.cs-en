Is it possible that you catch for another club in England?
It is a question on which I thought I would never refer to me.
But in football anything is possible.
I don't rule anything out.

The restoration of the very American ideal that employment rights are human rights
Kongresmeni Keith Ellison and John Lewis has proposed a law to protect the organisation in the union as a civil right.
"From the way the unions work, work jobs for the middle class," says Ellison, the Democratic senator for Minnesota, which is a Co-Chair of the Congressional Committee.
Therefore, I am so proud that I can imagine John Lewis, together with the model of the occasional rights law reinforcing the status of employees.
This groundbreaking legislation gives workers the same legal options, how to prevent discrimination in organizing a union, as with other forms of discrimination - and stop protiodborové forces
To amend the law on labour relations, so as to allow all employees, who face discrimination, if they want to join the union, the civil court judge - and get compensation or damages - is correct and necessary initiative.
But it is not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other plaintiffs in the law are, once again, is to establish the American ideal.
Despite the trade unions in the fight, which took place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - the Americans once supported countries throughout the world to adopt, wide and respect labor rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans is still remember, when the country in one breath to promote democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and his advisers encouraged the country to adopt the constitution, designed to ensure that the military autocracy, Hideki Toja will be replaced by a democracy.
They were convinced that the staff and their unions have a role to play in shaping the new Japan, included one language and openly acknowledged that "the right of workers to collect collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, Gen. Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisors exhorted Germans, to create a constitution that ensures that Adolf Hitler's fascism, will be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that the staff will be in the new nation need to organize and promote, and therefore include a clause, which openly says: "the right to form unions, which ensure and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed every individual and every occupation or profession.
The arrangement, which will restrict this right or will seek his injury, will be cancelled. Measures to comply with such purpose are illegal.
When the former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission for Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, it included the promoters and Roosevelt guarantee that "everyone has the right to form trade unions under the protection of his interests and join them."
For generations, Americans accepted the basic premise that the labour rights are human rights.
When other countries advised the country, as the Americans to create a civil and democratic society, explaining that the right to form labor unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with the companies and government agencies in an equal position - must be protected.
Now, when these rights are attacked in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize in a free and open society and to promote.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. Fifty years ago said:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the trade unions, the strength of the nation undiminished, but expanded it.
Raise the standard of living of millions of people, have created a market for industry and lifted the production on a previously unimaginable level.
Those who attack labor forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
He forgets history and we did, too.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human - and the extension of the protection of civil rights, so as to prevent discrimination in the organisation of the trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renewing ideals, which lifted America and make it the real promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the law from Louisiana, according to lawyers would probably closed all five clinics performing abortions in the state.
Regulation enacted by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindala in June, which is to enter into force on September 1, would require doctors performing abortions to have the right to adopt a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's resolution means that doctors can temporarily continue in the implementation of legal abortions and, in the meantime, he must get this permit.
"proposing the party will be able to operate legally and had obtained a permit," the federal judge John deGravellese stands in the resolution.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month, so the judge could issue a more permanent resolution concerning the law.
Abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, and said that it will give doctors more time to obtain a permit.
"Today's decision ensures women in Louisiana, that they will be safe from a tough law, which is to prepare for the health and their rights," said Nancy Northupová, president and executive director of the Center for reproductive rights, which the lawsuit on behalf of three of the five clinics for blocking the bill.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerns and the doctors of two clinics, which were among the, and also for the granting of permits.
Louisiana is among the 11 states that have approved similar laws in Alabama and Mississippi, taking such measures by the courts to declare the provision unconstitutional.
A key part of the Texas law, which would have a federal judge on Friday blocked most of the remaining clinics in the state.
Campaigners for women's rights to abortion, together with the Association of America of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Medical Association says that the need to have this permit places on the medical requirements that are necessary from a medical point of view.
Abortion opponents opposed, saying that the measures are designed to protect the health of women, and some of them also welcomed the fact that, because of the measures, the clinic were closed.
The Centre for Reproductive Rights argued that the authorisation has only one doctor performing abortions in Louisiana.
If all the doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, out of fear for their safety, this doctor would also stop surgery performed, the group said.
The Louisiana authorities indicated, in response, that would netrestaly doctors who perform abortions, while awaiting processing applications.

Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video tribute to his late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in the Australian outback higher risk that they will die of ovarian cancer, than their counterparts in the city.

The lowest survival rate was observed in older women, in whom the cancer was diagnosed in the advanced stage.
For women in rural and remote areas of the state was about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why it was higher for women living outside the city the likelihood that they will die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says factors may be late diagnosis and poor access to treatment.
"disease can best be treated gynekoonkologové, who is normally based in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of medical services at a distance, to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that would help strengthen transport services, which will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are treated far from their families and friends.
Dr. Jordan said that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low, regardless of geographical location, which highlights the need for better treatment and prevention programs.

When Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin on the reunion of his youth organisations, which reminds me most of all the Hitler Youth, rattling nuclear weapons and, in fact, made clear to everyone that their views are his stolen, gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia has many features of the fascist state.
Great nations have one thing in common, and that is that it can control how intense nationalism, so that they can transform an inferiority complex in the imperialist ambitions.
Time passes to the east, it seems, other than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the period of war for dominance over Europe is long gone, the East thinks the opposite, that have been ignored for a long time, and it is necessary to regain its international position.
Such frustration and mood prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, the power before the Nazis and then an explosion of nationalism, unlike the situation in Russia today.
And then the very same cult of the strong leader, the beating of journalists, the liquidation of uncomfortable political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, so it is indeed quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of the Russians probably miss, at a time when Russia was half of the world and the second part is shaking in front of them.
Western politicians think it their fault, maybe a little Vladimir patted his shoulders, maybe invite him where he wanted and maybe they underestimate him and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
Did he order at home, looking, that he actually did not go anywhere and sharpening knives at home.
Now decided to reclaim lost positions.
Start slowly, he has time.
The leader is about to life in prison, where he was in a hurry.
Trample Caucasians, now that Ukrainians, Baltic dwarfs are on the line.
You have to bite the Russian bear in the coat long enough.
You will notice that even China, which took a lot out and makes sure his eye to the Far East.
And you Germans that Vladimir too displeased, as they are so good and I gave them in the ass 45.
What do you like this one new Novorosiju in Karlovy Vary.
It would have been základnička and there are a lot of us and how there is oppress also wanted to have a dacha constable of them down.
Our veterans should've vzpomnají Czechoslovakia in it.
Well he vot their Prime Minister gospodin Sobotka, that is so měký, you can peel an onion and eat the whole of the EU.
It would then played, to the great Russia surged.
It is necessary to remind them where their place is.
And as detonators, we will use our compatriots who live on their territory.
Russians everywhere is enough and when he says that there is oppress, there's just oppress and it won't leave us so we can protect them.
And again, it will be the Russian rule, but what else is born.
Europe isn't just good dance as a preposition, to which Ivan can be proud of.

In addition, the public must have seen me, I had to learn between 1975 and 1985, too, how to make a joke, to be a star to appear on the TV and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Whereas his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White minstrel Show, entertainment programme, in which the actors changed for the blacks, Henry in it with his comedy finally acted for five years.
My family because he was worried.
I wish that it had never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was strange and embarrassing position, I worked on the big stages, and learned how to work a crowd.
What was "years and years at the main product of British television," but was also "a grotesque parody of the blacks."
Henry worked in the alternative comedy circles in the 1980s and introduced the figures at the same time, they also celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began broadcasting in 1984 and was in the late 1990s, among other things, known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in comedy seriále Chef!.
The next decade he worked in advertising, documents, television series and its role in the movies, but after the airing his LennyHenry.tv series on the BBC in 2008, he said: "So what do you do now, Len, a little bit, because it seems that you were stuck in one place, or miss a little bit out of the way."
Next was a Radio 4 documentary entitled What's So Great About.................................................? / What is so great on.................................................?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
In school we were taught him well, and I thought that's something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone with whom we are in an interview, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said: "You should try it."
Give to it, if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love so much Shakespeare.
Henry for the document presented twenty rows of Othellovy final speech and I rode in it.
It gave me the feeling that I can do it.
As if it gave me courage.
"that's about it. It is a serious matter, take it seriously, learn the text, something to learn about it.
So it was hard for testing and before I read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
It seemed that they expect trouble, which happened.
Soon began to play in a comedy of errors.
Suddenly, I was at the National Theatre. I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought: "You've changed."
The technical defects and Henry instinctively felt that he must take responsibility for the seizure of the audience.
"the voice in my head said: "than you have to fix the computer is now ten minutes of fun.""
Instead, the theater director, announced that the show will continue, as will solve the problem.
I walked away from the stage and something in me said: 'Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"play, so stay in the role."
Henry in fences at the Duchess Theatre
To learn the text fences was a challenge.
The panic is quite good, the commitment adds.
The game was also well received, so it's like a sign from God, which says: "this is what you should do."
Of course, it said in a loud voice.
So there I am.
I really like it.
I like the service.
Henry still remains the brain comedian - throughout our conversation interrupts humornými performances ever gotten into and out of the role.
I decided to do stand-upy, because I have the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, he said.
Still, when you're looking for something, you can get into a blind alley.
Sometimes, when I'm Live at the Apollo, but I'm as happy as ever.
I asked, if ever organized a stand-up comedy tour.
The joy of sitting in the same room with the director, who helps to shape the beginning, middle and end - I don't think I ever wanted to give up.
So your new incarnation?
Yes, I think so.
Acting like me.
It's fun.
Still telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers, state officials to light to a nonexistent employee
Kenya began with biometric registration of all its officials to try and remove a non-existent staff from the government payroll.
According to the statement of the government employees, who are required to register in the next two weeks, will receive the payment.
The government believes that thousands of people receive a salary even after he left government service.
After he took office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in public administration.
The audit carried out in this year showed that the state comes a month at least one million dollars of 700 000 pounds on transfers of nonexistent employees and a further abuse of official power.
The government also suspects that salaries are still being sent to bank accounts after the death of a staff member or, after an employee leaves the government administration, a BBC reporter said from the capital, Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All the officials must attend to the identification centres where their data will be biometricky recorded during the next two weeks, the government says in a statement.
It also says that anyone who does not appear without sufficient apology, will be excluded from the payroll.
"the identification of the actual public service employees this measure will contribute significantly to rationalise it and also will be used to unclog the payroll at both levels of government, and solve the problem of employees," said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested because of a "conspiracy" against the government
Local media reported that in Turkey have been detained for a total of 33 policemen suspected of "conspiracy against the government.
So far, the police office has made no comment.
According to the Hurriyet Dail News was among detainees fourteen high-ranking officials.
Some of them were implicated in the corruption investigation, which focused on government officials, including four ministers in December.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and telephone eavesdropping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Prime Minister at the time described their meeting as part of the Islamic spiritual wrested against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most of the schools in the Ukraine on Monday 1 September after the summer holidays reopened.
This is an important day for the traditional family and thousands of other Ukrainian parents, as well as the prime minister Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the assembled journalists, not all schools are open again, but that it is determined to defend the country for the next generation:
No traditional ceremony took place at all schools to 1.září.
Not the whole of Ukraine is peace.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Slavjansku Pastukhov, a teacher at the school, which is attended by Jaceňukova daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that this will finally be achieved peace and that children receive the knowledge that they will be useful in the future.
On the first day of school is traditionally celebrated, so that children can dress embroidered shirts, balloons and teachers will give flowers.
In Roně Fairheadové might find the BBC boss for hard times
He carries with him the clouds of glory from the world of banking, media management and internal Conservative party conclave.
She has the experience of the front lines.
His career began in consultants Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the media world Pearsons.
Seven years was the executive director of the Financial Times. The post resigned when he took the top job in the parent company Pearson's her younger colleague.
They say that her severance approaching million pounds.
Her political portfolio is too large.
David Cameron has been recommended by Lord Browne, former director of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed private expertise: Became an adviser to the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former member of the City Council.
In May, I described the work of the director as a poison chalice.
Not only that, the BBC is extensive and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: On the top layer in the hierarchy of the BBC's own leadership, but also the voice of the public in the days of unrest if things don't work out.
It is an almost unsustainable monopoly, which calls for a thorough reform.
But the director would risk that comes into the company's complex as the Chinese dynasty, spread it and prepare himself for a job.
It's a tough call.
If it were not so hard, a lot of people would like to see how the BBC is shrinking - its power, its finances - and how to revise its status.
With how to extend the scope of competition and new technology challenges old certainties, carries with it the immediate negotiations on licence fees for the BBC in great danger.
For a modest sum of £145,50 per year, the British public buys a share in what is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: Claims that its production of 96% of households, and each is only 40 pence a day.
In addition, the BBC's popularity is clearly rising: 53% of supporters, compared with 31% a decade ago.
The use of the services of the BBC models have changed: Today's headlines are displayed on a mobile phone, and on the shows I miss, I can look at iPlayeru.
But the BBC remains very beloved and wonderful institutions.
He needs a wonderful director - I hope to find one.
Texas Governor Perry argues that the offensive tweet approve
Tweet from the official account twitterového Texas Governor Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained the offensive image of a democratic state Representative Perry, who initiated the criminal charges of abuse of power.
Tweet was later deleted, and Perry's account was made public a further distanced from the previous one.
Tweet went from my account, which was not authorized.
"I do not agree with tweetem and I pulled him," said in another post.
Perry's aides did not respond to messages with questions immediately.
Although Tweety were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published unflattering, humorous image of Travis County Attorney Rosemary Lehmbergové, who was sentenced in April 2013 for drunk driving.
When he refused to resign, Perry rejected the disbursement of funds for her office, which Perry, a potential candidate for president in 2016, this month's elections brought before a grand jury in Austin.
The label in tweetu said: "Not always run with blood alcohol levels three times higher than the allowed limit................................................. But now, yes, so sue me, Governor Perry calls to account for it."
I am the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry led Lehmbergové Authority.
The charge was a special prosecutor Michael McCrum, of San Antonio, who has been appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the charges political, tactical maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the judge supervising the case, rejected the accusations, the longest serving governor in Texas history to prosecution because the use of the law is unconstitutional.
Perry said the payment of $7.5 million of public funds for the department to defend the public interest, which has headquarters in Travis County and prosecute corruption in Texas, after Lehmbergová refused to resign.
The dismissal triggered a formal complaint a left-leaning group civil society activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes even on the map.
In Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, after he had finished in fifth place in the committee of his party, said Perry on speculation that he could end up with their own picture, how he runs, tweetem, near the lake, and the words: "I'm here, South Charlotte!"

However, because of the strengthening pound are not so attractive to foreign buyers of London property in recent months - some of them also intimidate the introduction of new taxes on real estate and talk of a possible "tax capital," to which politicians came before parliamentary elections next May.
London estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the revision of the mortgage market, which has introduced stricter rules for loans, real estate sales and prices will slow the pace of growth in the market during the second half of the year as well.
The Bank of England's new data on Monday showed a decrease in the number of mortgages approved for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is cooling down.
Hamptons International, another real estate office, declined on the basis that home prices have already started to decrease, on London real estate prices in its growth forecast for the year 2015 at 3%.
The volume of transactions under the real estate agent WA Ellis meanwhile in London's most expensive neighborhoods like Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington each year has fallen by a quarter.
Yet the demand for housing in the capital city of Berkeley was a blessing, because the cash for forward sales increased to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: "demand that right, a good housing in good location remained the same, and to keep the forward sale."
In June, the company announced that from the beginning of the year to the end of April 3 742 property sold, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.

The extraordinary demonstration of the showpiece of Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J"
It was disbanded, it is the best way to describe it, gradually spread as kartonová box, which had been left out in the rain.
Only from time to time, he told a woman that she is too serious, complex, sharp, isolated and maybe a little irritable.
And then he shook her hand.
He irritably admitted it.
He could shoot up, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of his ability was the beginning of a love affair more than usual, promised that his relieved from the lonely life of boredom and maybe even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomonsová was fragile beauty with a wild mane of hair and volatile at the heart of the village on the northern island, which was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
The older companion Kevern thought came to the south, that is her aunt, who inherited the property in the damp, but beautiful valley called, fittingly, Eden Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
Through the pipes, the tanks were dead spiders, slugs oslizle signed on the window, as if they thought they owned the place, the garden was overgrown with weeds and looked like a giant cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, both frightening and charming, with a garden full of secrets.
The profile of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the list of nominations for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
A shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on folding chairs in the long grass, holding hands, enjoying unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuned public station, a region with a comforting music and soothing reports, when the old song reminded him that look on her tanned legs crossed long forgotten black comedy, which is drawn shades like listening to his father.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggressiveness has played such songs in radio.
They have not been banned - nothing actually banned - just to play.
Help them to get into desuetuda, as well as the very word desuetudo.
It proved popular taste, what would never regulations and standing outside the law, and as people who choose the books, memoirs, in which the poor became rich, cooks and romance novels, so in music to collect ballads.
Kavern himself down on the day and began to play an imaginary piano and crude, comic voice singing serenade Aillininým big feet.
Ailinn said.
"It was a favorite song from the jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said automatically put two fingers to his lips.
His father always did, when he wanted to suppress point j, before he comes out of his mouth.
It started as a game, when he was a child.
His father said that he played the game with his father.
When you put in words, what was the j, gave two fingers before a kiss, it cost you a penny.
At the time it wasn't very funny, and it wasn't that funny, even now.
But he knew it was expected of him, that was it.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of.
Even jazz, though not directly outlawed, played.
Improvisation went out of fashion.
In life there was only room for one "if."
When he began to play a tune, people wanted to know exactly where it will end.
The same thing with humor.
His nepředvidatelnost went on people's nerves.
And the humor was jazz songs.
Although up to ten years heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew jazz polotajné from his father's collection of old CDs.
But at least Aillin didn't have to say, Fats Waller was black.
Owing to his age, he could not remember a time when blacks were popular singers.
Without the law or coercion, too.
The docile society, that is, in which every part of it with gratitude - gratitude, those were fortuitously Ironman - agrees with the principle of collective gratitude.
The people of temperament and stature afro-karibského threw for entertainment and athletics, and so were singing and shouting.
People originating from the Indian subcontinent, natural talent for electronics, take responsibility for it, that there will be no family without a functioning telephone.
The Poles that remained were plumbers, Greeks, left, wash the dishes.
Those of the states of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents quickly left the country, while the cannon, DO TO HAPPEN TO HAPPEN TO - feared, that is accused, that would put into the fire, he feared that the fire next time spent is - opened a restaurant, where he sold labneh and smoking water pipes, neupozorňovali on himself and inaction is slowly consumed.
Each according to his talent.
Whereas only ballads, Ailinn listened hard to understand, how could arise from dirty words, which she just sang Kavern, music.
The music was an expression of love.
"actually not bad," said Kevern.
Perhaps only for people who have very big feet.
My father never offended anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too, but neglected garden gave the illusion of security.
No word from behind a soundproof leaves could not escape.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
To say that it was a joke, but was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
I thought, that's weird.
"it seemed funny," he said.
Shook her head in disbelief and overshadowed Kevernovi view.
Throughout the world there was nothing other than a tangle of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say so," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why I sing it.
She looked really upset.
I'm very large feet?
He looked again.
Not quite the feet.
Maybe a little ankles.................................................
You say you hate me, because I'm very thick ankles?
I hate?
That's not true.
It's just a silly song.
She could say "I love you," but it was too early.
"your fat ankles just attracted me," he said.
I'm a bit of a pervert.
It had failed.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, often it got him into trouble, because, like his father, lacked the magic be able to tame the cruelty that lurked in jokes.
Perhaps his father was intentionally cruel.
He may have been intentionally cruel Kavern.
Despite the gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomonsová red and rose from his chair, knocking over the radio and unfinished wine.
Elderberry wine, so you could drink for it.
It seemed that, in his excitement, shaking like palm fronds in the storm.
"perversely attracts me, you're an idiot," she said.................................................
Except for the fact that I was attracted to.
He was sorry for her, as for his unkind words because of the fear in her eyes at a moment when set against him.
She thought she hit her?
Talking with him about life on the cold northern peninsula, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that the foundation, it was the same as here.
The same vast Arctic and broke on them.
The same deranged man, then, WHAT HAPPENED, even Feistier and grumpier than their ancestors, runners and blockers, he wandered from pub to pub, ready to reach out to any woman who would dare to refuse or to laugh at them.
Stupid?
If he doesn't pay attention to her my fists!
Her first pet - pet has become the most common expression for erotic stimulation lackluster ballads about love between a man and a woman: An antibody that radio spat - first caress her, then hit her one.
According to opinion Kevernova because too much sophistication, cuddling was in itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomonsová non-verbally told him to leave.
He rose from the chair as the old man.
She felt upset, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
He almost didn't know.
Watching him go - as if he was watching from a window on the second floor - a man driven, what he did.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart for him because of all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few zbilo her.
The man turned away from her, shoulders slumped, humiliated, beaten, all fighting left him - why it felt that this look familiar, although she couldn't recall a single moment, until today, that it would ever seen?
Ailinn Solomonsová alone again, looked down at her feet.
Twenty years after these events Esme Nussbaumová, intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working in Ofnow nestatutárním monitoring system Public mood, has prepared a brief article about the persistence of light and moderate acts of violence in the areas of the country, where his mitigation or directly to a halt, as expected, if enough money and energy was spent at his disposal.
"made a lot and a lot still to be done," she wrote, "in order to calm the inherent aggressiveness of men who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in hard-to-reach places, something the country despite the tip of church towers over the hedges tinge of human kindness has seldom appeared."
Some things, however, are irreplaceable.
It seems that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
People moan over sentimental baladami, devouring the unfortunate stories and declaring that he firmly believes in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that keeps the old brutality in rurálních areas as stubbornly as in urban areas, but the evidence also shows that, at home, in the workplace, on roads and even sports, there is a new and aggressive intolerance.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too květnatému style," said her manager.
I would suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaumová bowed her head.
Also I must ask: Are you an atheist?
"I have the impression that I don't have to answer," said Esme Nussbaumová.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again said his right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Another silence.
"I don't ask why," Rabinowitz said, "that I have anything against atheists, lesbians or feministkám.
We don't have this bias in the workplace.
We serve unbiased society.
But as a kind of hypersensitivity, which is perfectly acceptable and laudable in itself, can sometimes distort judgment, as you did it.
Obviously you're prejudiced against the Church - things that others would call "cruel" and "brutal" could also be interpreted as an expression of energy and natural forces.
Still to be resolved, WHAT HAPPENED TO HAPPEN TO, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, is preparing the country with its fundamental life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaumová looked around.
For his head on the board of light pink flashed a recommendation that Ofnow broadcast to the world in the last quarter century or more.
Smile on their neighbour, tending his partner, listen ballads, walk on musicals, use your phone, socialize, get Explain the excuse.
Talking is better than nothing, sung by the word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your concerns," she said quietly Esme Nussbaumová when she was sure that her boss was finished," and I am not saying that the wound healed, so as to pretend that it healed.
My main concern is that if we don't alerted in advance, repeating the same mistake that led to it, KDYBY, WHAT HAPPENED TO HAPPEN TO.
This time, but we do not vent anger and mistrust of the other.
Luther Rabinowitz teamed with his fingertips.
That should mean an infinite patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when the steps that they might do and maybe did your grandparents, described as a mistake.
Too much in the way that you're talking about the fact that they thought their "anger" and "disbelief" to "other."
I didn't have someone in your place, of course, in the understanding of the past and in the presence of the protection we are not talking about "us" and "them."
There was no "we" and no "them."
We only know that it was a chaotic time.
"during which, if any, to be honest with each other," Esme gathered the courage," no one we are not blameless.
Don't blame anybody.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened, happened.
That was before.
This is not what we say - in this together.
And as there is no fault, which could be blamed on someone, even things that should be remedied, even if the correction was appropriate and possible.
But to what else is in the past, than to learn from it -
The past is that we forgot her.
If I can add something -
Luther Rabinowitz discorporated fingertips.
"I take your report into account," he said, and dismissed her.
On that day, when she went to work as usual, it hit a motorcyclist, who ran on the pavement in a way that people described as "brutal and savage."
Accidents happen.
The army of Lesotho says that no coup plans - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of Lesotho denied that organized a coup to overthrow the government, saying that it acted against the police suspected of attempted armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, and says that the army surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
After the Prime Minister declared that his death threats, left with his family in neighboring South Africa.
Military spokesman Maj. Ntlele Ntoi said that, in fact, it was not a coup, but the military's response to the threat of "political fanatics," which tried to arm the police.
"This morning command defenses of the Kingdom of Lesotho was, after it was found in the ranks of the police received several reports, information services, several groups are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics, who were preparing to wreak havoc in the country," he said of the Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has that power took the government by force, seems to have action lesothských defenses of the coup," he said.
Military leaders of Lesotho and said that on Sunday the soldiers returned to their barracks in the capital was quiet.
Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing during Thabanovy absence will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said that in his view, is the target of the attack because of their efforts to fight against corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended parliament session because of internal disputes, there is tension in Lesotho.
He said that, despite claims to the contrary, his behaviour undermines the government.
Manufacturing in the eurozone is at a minimum třináctiměsíčním
The growth of production, according to a closely followed survey in August in the euro zone slowed to a thirteen-month low.
The index of purchasing managers in the eurozone PMI from June's 51.8 fell to 50.7 in August.
A number above 50 indicates expansion.
Fewer new orders and factories damaged the growing tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The numbers come from Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank and the ECB.
The markets will want a clear plan from the banks, how to deal with the eurozone oddalovaným ozdravením even with the threat of deflation, with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
There is speculation that the president of the ECB, Mario Draghi, perhaps this week indicated that he is considering quantitative easing in the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom joined during the financial crisis and the US.
"although at least some growth is better than no growth, braking effect, which has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the manufacturer, is still visible," said Rob Dobson, the Markit chief economist.
Germany's manufacturing PMI, Russia's biggest trading partner in the EU, fell to the 11-month-old minimum 51,4.
In the second largest economy in the zone, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
The concern is about France, Italy again went from this expansion of stagnation.
Signs that the driving force behind the growth in the major industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands had disappeared, also is not very reassuring," Dobson said.
The slowdown of the industry is likely to pour oil into the fire analysts anticipating the implementation of further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.5, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "the best that can be said about the manufacturing purchasing managers survey for August, is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: Producers in the euro area are currently life very complicated, because of rising geopolitical tension - between Russia and Ukraine in particular - adds even more uncertainty to the increasingly difficult conditions in many countries.
This increasing insecurity trade demonstrably hit - and particularly consumer confidence, which may cause some orders will be postponed or even canceled, mainly those expensive.
That seems "more likely" that, in the end, the ECB will have to carry out some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect that it will be limited."

As of September 1, 2004, at the start of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest depths of hell.
The opposition over the tragedy linked to the east and west, which in this catastrophic disaster led to negotiations and the future.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia, to seek out some of the victims, which escaped death during atrocities in school.
We found amazing young people who resisted the disaster, even though the memory of the inferno caused by terrorists in them will live on.
What is their biggest wish?
To the war, which is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children are dying as they were - is over.
The girl trying to climb back into the school gym destroyed
It was captured by the Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakovem, only in their underwear trying to climb back into the bombed school gymnasium, after a bomb exploded in her.
Confused Aida Larissu desperately searching for his mother, who is now 40.
The fear was that the two of them are dead, but in fact survived.
"a woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
I had the legs from the blood.
I got up and went back to find his mother.
The soldier rescued her.
After several operations, thought to have fully recovered, but said yesterday: "three months before the pain returned.
I'm afraid that I'm going to have another operation.
In my knee remained pieces of shrapnel.
Its aim is to become a dentist to help people as doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly did not destroy him," she said firmly.
"I just happened, and you can't change it.
Once a year I go to the gym, to remind those who stayed there.
Otherwise we with friends to talk about it.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future girl in the class Džeru Gapoevu was killed there.
Small as we played together and we were together, we will go to school.
"I don't want to get married until they finish school and start a career.
I think about the family later.
He says he forgot the capture, but memories fade a little every year.
I'm glad that so many people around the world still remembers what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at the Internet at your picture, as the school's climbing out of the window, I'm saying that a lot of people will see it for the first time, will understand this catastrophe and avoid repeating itself.
The boy, who escaped the rain of bullets, and believed that his mother is dead
It was his first day of school children start school in seven years in Russia and survived the three-day siege of a school in the arms of his mother, Tamara.
At the time, seven-year-old said: "Mum told me that if there was an explosion, I lie on the ground and hold her hand."
After the explosion, he thought that his mother was dying.
She told him: "Run."
He was afraid that she is dead, running and saw the crying baby on the way, grabbed the child by the hand and ran a spray of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who caught him out, he said: "Damir told me that his mother is dead."
He says: "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara dopotácela on freedom and lay in the hospital with an injured foot and, on the other hand, thought that her son had died.
After they met again, said: "I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
Came in and gave me a hug.
Damir then flew to London, according to the defunct News of the World newspaper, where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie declared winner Bernardo's Children.
"The terror returns every day, but I wish to stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are fading.
I remember that I then threw away all my toy pistols.
Today, but I can play computer games in which to shoot, and I have no problem with it.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think of myself.
I remember the children, with whom I was playing in the yard and reached out.
Never say that is killed or died.
We say that remained in the gym.
On a trip to London I remember well, mainly on how I could choose a toy store anything I wanted, and as I rode convertible.
But now fears about places like Ukraine, where are suffering because of the war as well as he and his friends had suffered.
The horror is returning every day, but I wish to stop thinking about it
"I am very sorry to anyone with such terror must go through," said Damir, who last week attended volunteering at the monastery.
I very much want to help.
Once I want to work with the police, and I hope that next year would take me at the academy.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: "They killed 37 children from our neighbourhood, can you imagine that?
I remember the silence on it soon after the attack, there were no children there would be screaming and running, and the silence that lasted for several months.
Vividly remembers the journey to London with Damirem.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
Cherie Blairové and its foundation for the price, and was grateful for the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though it's been ten years, still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London and how to help me and Damirovi.
I remember how he had a taste for borscht Damir, and so called all Russian restaurant.
I remember how to play in a restaurant with waiters, Damir was firing at them from a water pistol and they were running and playing with him.
And it was only a month from the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share with us on our pain and how to support us.
She said: "I still think that the world has changed in the ten years for the better.
The war in Ukraine is now, people are dying every day, and I think that was and still too many children will be killed.
Children are the same as ours.
I think that war is just something for a lot of people in the news, which they will do it, if he is bored or while doing something else.
I know what these people are living, what is this horror.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up, and it's nice and quiet kid from it, it is not aggressive or angry.
For example, desire for revenge, that doesn't interest him at all.
I know that you don't remember, but is very close to six classmates and from time to time she goes to the gym and lit candles there.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - remember ever lay on the couch with his face away from us and sometimes so lay for hours.
Sleep, his eyes were open.
Remember, too, that all fired their guns or other weapons on playing Damirovi today is 17, is higher than I am, handsome, clever and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was sure that he is dead, and that he would never see him again for several hours.
When I recovered after the explosion and rose to his feet, I looked around and saw the hell, pieces of human flesh were everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
"I remember I was screaming "Damire, run, run, run!', but I was convinced that he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and ran away.
So our life is unlike other continued.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose image has become a symbol of the horrors the photo after the attack in Beslan
Comfort: Survivors of Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, right, Grigory today
When he ran for his life after the Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, was in his bloodied face vrytý fear.
His photo was one of the most shocking atrocities in Beslan symbols.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, his older son Vladimir dropped him on his first day at school and hurried off to college.
"I went for two minutes before the terrorists stormed the yard, so my little boy there three days alone," she said.
Not entirely alone, because we have had relatives there, but all of them died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it is still difficult to think about it and talk.
Since then, not one day to remember the tragedy.
Seems to us that it happened a long time ago, I have the feeling that it was yesterday, some moments I keep coming back.
I promise I will never forget.
Recurring memories: Grigori photo left was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was described as a statue of the right
I remember the day Grigory very forward to school, he said that he wants to hug their teacher.
That is alive, I learned when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino is even the statue crying Gregor.
Grigory don't like looking at the picture and at home we have it hidden in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I think that because of the image around the world, people know what pain we feel.
Grigory said today: "The important thing is that this will not happen again.
"I doubt that we'll ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still under investigation, but the truth, you never know.
Now are investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.
We are sometimes, what was the cause?
The world is waiting for something bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, so no one wants war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We have at least a little bit, needs for decades.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years, I had nightmares about the attack, but then it has improved.
When I went back to school in 2004, every day I was scared.
I thought of my friends and classmates were killed.
Therefore, when approaching 1 September, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of her childhood friends.
It is hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I won't forget it, but it is.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and began to study medicine at university in Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
At first I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of health.
I wanted to fight for their country, but it won't work.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
The boy, who survived, even though he was kept at the feet of the murderous terrorists
A miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held during the attack at the feet of the murderous terrorists, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, was trapped in the gym, sitting beside the bombs at the feet of the murderous terrorists.
It's a miracle that he survived.
"It seems to us, as if it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injuries suffered during the attack, he couldn't.
It is still with me, it's not something I threw behind his head.
Now I'm older, and says that children can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say that's not true.
"I went to a psychologist in 2006 and then I was a little bit better, but I can't forget.
And I forgot.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I walked into the gym again.
I fainted.
Already there never again go and don't ask me to show you where it well known in the picture, please sit.
Survivors: Gregory Farniev today, on his laptop photographs taken at the hospital after the attack
The pain is immense and I'm taking her with him every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and never ask me questions at the school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful that I cut on my knee, but no longer walk.
But even so, I couldn't get because of health and study the FSS Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent them my documents including medical reports and responded to me, that's not possible.
My other hobby are animals, so I got to vet school.
I finished second year there.
Learn how to treat all animals from "cats after the cows."
He said: "I know that their children would never talk about it.
It's not something about what children should know and not something that should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "The pain will still be here.
Is there, and it is getting worse with the approaching anniversary.
I will attend, ceremony.
I know, Grigory won't work.
It must be even stronger for it, because there was a difference from me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that I returned it. There are signs everywhere in Beslan.
It remains with us.
Gregory today is an adult, but the horror he carries on.
It is difficult to accept when something happens to you so terribly unfair.
It's a boy, loves the sport, but it cannot do it for his knee.
Underwent several operations, can walk, but cannot exercise.
I would say that from 50% to overcome the terror, but to overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will be with us always.
During the attack killed a lot of our friends and neighbors, and that the pain is only getting worse.
I lost a lot of people that I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift I could give a god, but the loss of the slain hurts.
I know the family, in which other children were born, but also the widow had married again.
It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget, my heart almost jumped out of my chest, when I saw him in the hospital.
Now, watching what's happening in the world - the war in other places.
These people are fighting for what?
Why kill each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe it.
In the past we were one friendly country, so how we got to this, that together we now?
The people and the children are suffering, and I am sure that many children in Ukraine was still will be killed.
I wish we could take all those rebels and discard them - as far as it goes.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child carried by special commandos to safety
Rescued: Alyonu Tskaevu bears to secure Russian special commandos left.
She is now ten right and had no recollection of the tragedy
The world gasped in 2004, when a small Alyonu carried in the arms of the Beslan hostage Russian policeman.
The terrorists released, however, in captivity in the school gym left her 30-year mother, a brother and sister Kristinu Makhara.
Makhar, which at the time was three years old, escaped, but Alyonina mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan married again and his new wife Svetlana have the baby girl, named after the dead daughter Kristina.
Neighbors say Alyona, which is now ten, had no recollection of the attack and grew out of her bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said that "it's a big happy family and Alyona Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is a good father and wants to keep the children away from the memories, which reminds the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips, as under the water to get better photos and videos
If you are interested in photography or filming underwater, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or outdoor type of GoPro Hero3 camera + Silver Edition, which costs around $300.
These pictures I took the family celebration a few cameras, all were less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but a few rules apply for achieving the best results.
Double-check equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Also set the camera, depending on what type you will take photos or videos.
Some cameras and video cameras are scenic or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to the dark environment under the water.
And before you go, check how far you can dip their equipment.
Some cameras are intended only to 5 feet, the next 50 to 60.
Read our guide to the purchase and evaluation of digital cameras in the ordinary course and a waterproof design.
Always do a few frames - a lot of them won't work.
Compact cameras are outdoor LCD, which will help you to compose pictures, but do not have it.
Although LCD underwater, you would be wrong to see the scope and the composition will be nepředvidatelná.
So always do more frames.
If the camera has bracketingový scheme, which makes a series of pictures with a slightly different diffusion of exposure, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper immersion lights significantly diminished.
If it is possible, stay close to the photo shoot in the swimming pool, lake or sea levels.
It will also allow you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you dive, the less you see colors.
Get close to fotografovanému object.
This is excellent advice, if the pictures on land, but underwater is even more important because tlumenějšímu light.
This is particularly important if the camera filming with outdoorovou: Such devices are usually hard and wide angle lenses, which means that if you want to fill fotorámeček, you have to approach more objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality could change things even in such a huge organisation like the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist devoted his career to the sick eased the pain caused by the disease and treatment.
His wife recalled that one of the people who seek his help, was an MI6 officer, who had to live with the consequences of torture, which mauled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, patients overwhelmingly interested in something else: The pain.
One day in 2007, but it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in your skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without power.
Faced with flu symptoms, and found that it is impatient and his wife Juliet includes remorse.
He said: "I want everything to happen sooner rather than later."
When Juliet on the week has gone on a business trip, Lawson was strangely and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
His colleague did a chest X-ray.
One two weeks before skiing in the French Alps.
The results came an X-ray.
He had an incurable mesothelioma, a cancer that affects the pleura or the lining of the lungs.
For most types of cancer, it is difficult to determine what was their cause.
Though some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer, smoking.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases is caused by exposure to asbestos - building fibrous material, which was previously described as a "miracle," but today knows that it's deadly.
For most of us, it was hard to ignore mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos came into force in the industry.
Even at a time when asbestos was used, came into close contact with him only a certain group of people, for example, isolation pokladači, developers, carpenters and workers in the shipyards.
A toxin used in industry, in a different era now hardly seems like a reason for concern.
But such complacency is misplaced.
As it turns out, in Britain today culminates mezoteliomová epidemic.
The number of deaths on mesothelioma is higher than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths a year on this disease is more than twice the number of victims of car accidents.
The number of deaths on the consequences of mezoteliomu per year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the UK in the future
Why only now feel its effects, although the use of asbestos is already illegal years of all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999, is that usually takes decades to develop mesothelioma.
A disaster in the form of mezoteliomu concern not only veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and still is, in many cases, present in homes, in which we live, we work in offices, where, in schools, where we learn, and in the shops, in which we buy.
Mesothelioma, therefore, does not respect the social layer, wealth, occupation and age.
Privileged bastions from London's commercial home after public schools do not cover.
Parliament, too, is full of asbestos.
Even the hospital, in which they would treat us, are the repository of deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor did the isolation.
He was trying to find out where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then it came to that.
"it is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors, Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years of practice," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and janitors - using the corridor.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries gets the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question on which part could answer.
"of the four doctors who had been on the practice in Guy's Hospital and for which is then shown to mesothelioma in the past five years," he said in the letter, in 2010, "I'm the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma, when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
Survive so long with this diagnosis is not normal.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months from diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
Now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us get sick of the same disease?"
According to a leading British expert on mesothelioma Professor Julian Pete is the best estimate that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is about 90 000 people die.
The majority of them currently has no idea that he was going to die in this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A cursory inspection of the files from the archives of the courts, which often turn to disability and require compensation, shows how much mezoteliomická disaster has spread.
For example, the company admitted this June that Marks & Spencer negligently exposed to asbestos Janice Allenovou.
Worked for a string of nine years, from 1978 to roku1987 when the section overseen in two stores with clothes - was one of the places, the company's flagship store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when he began to work for M & S.
Now has two children in their 20s.
"before it happened," he says, "I've never heard of mezoteliomu, I barely knew something about asbestos.
I never dreamed that I could somehow concern.
Not too many people who know something about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name was due to its fibrotic structure, which gives him the strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in the construction industry.
Most chryzotil, commonly known as white asbestos is in the buildings can be found today.
It was used in the roof panels, floor tiles, bojlerových gaskets and even the brake linings.
It is not as lethal as other forms of asbestos, the EU and the WHO still considered "a major health risk," which can cause death.
But the more dangerous is the brown asbestos amosite, crocidolite blue asbestos.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos and experts argue that "there is strong, but circumstantial evidence that it was the main cause of an unusually high incidence of mezoteliomu [in the UK]."
The Marsk & Spencer employee had been exposed to asbestos in the flagship store in Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not be regarded as a typical victim mezoteliomu, but the work of Julian Pete points out that her story is not unusual.
His study of patients, he says, "a substantial part of mezoteliomu cases with no known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
A large part of this exposure is caused by "normal use and weathering" buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that it is safe.
Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the center of the government may not know that they might be exposed to asbestos.
The Goddard report published in 2009, according to which the service elevators and the pipeline for rooms of the Parliamentary Committee are contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be infringed by something as benign as "a strong current of air."
The ministers are often accused of care only about their own interests, but in this case, the opposite may be true.
Although the services of Parliament took to the Palace of Westminster had "a medical certificate," is now, with one million pounds will be needed, and several years of work for Parliament to be inspected thoroughly modernised electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the election in 2015 will Members rather than sit on the green benches at Westminster in the premises of the conference center of Queen Elizabeth II.
The Goddard report says that "the presence of asbestos is not in compliance with the rules."
It is not possible to say whether this mismatch will cost lives.
Now they can only wait.
One of the persons that were never able to determine, among them an exposure to asbestos, Abbott's Graham, the doctor.
As Andrew Lawson has Abbott, 50, on suspicion that he was exposed to asbestos at work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital, where the presence of asbestos has been demonstrated," he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when something like chills zdolalo him.
He was 45, was in the evening and was in the middle of the operation.
I suddenly began to shake.
It came at a time.
I was miserable.
I thought nedojedu drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain stems from pleurisy, lining around the lungs.
But as Janice Allen had no reason to believe that this is a mesothelioma.
In the end, he spent a month at home.
Baffled doctors made him a chest X-ray and introduced his chest catheter, to remove fluid from his lungs, which were sent for analysis.
Yet diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
From time to time but his symptoms returned, often after he flexed and winded.
In 2011 came to the operating room one Abbottových patients with similar symptoms and subsequently mesothelioma was diagnosed with him.
But even then, Abbott's touch with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and in the work he came into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the link was clear.
In September 2011, Abbottův relapse and his doctor checked his CT scans and X-rays with the panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel sick, he has been introduced into the space between the thoracic cavity inlay and lung inlay probe equipped with a camera.
I am an optimist.
I have a tendency not to take too much," he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry.
But my wife, Rachel, do not worry.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and the New Year: "They told me that it is mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began to meet sisters from the charity Macmillan and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At the moment he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"it turned out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, which are often asbestos thermal insulation in the pipeline," he says.
For people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to show.
Mesothelioma is therefore now begins, relate to younger people who do not have risk jobs.
The most dangerous pipes insulated with asbestos in hospitals were in the basement, so it was unlikely that would endanger patients.
But staff members, who crossed the suterénními passages between buildings as Andrew Lawson, or eating in the basement canteens as often as Graham Abbott certainly came into contact with a toxic substance.
Both are now shows, were several decades after the war, the hospital where patients could save your life, but also a place that could threaten the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is removed to this day.
The students a Bunsen burner built on asbestos backing
And it's not just about the hospital.
Asbestos is often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls for his excellent isolation and fire-resistant properties.
Also in schools.
In reality, many people were exposed to asbestos in school anymore.
Somewhere in the countless hours of chemistry students built a Bunsen burner on the asbestos mat.
Created a website dedicated to the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles on the roof shelters or tools in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
"it is an industrial poison into a large number of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented by Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case was the only contact with asbestos, on which he could remember a woman suffering from mesothelioma, in the 1970s when breaking down the garden cottage.
So watch how boříte garden cottage.
With the knowledge that the disease is incurable, the impact of a diagnosis is huge.
"It takes a while before you realize it," Graham says Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I found that I can't concentrate on what I'm doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized that I have to go and deal with himself.
Well, other Christmas to survive.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a position of doctors at the position of the patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how he felt confused the quantity of information, with whom he had to deal with.
"it was hard to understand," he says.
"I asked the doctor: "How much time do I have?"
I was told that the twelve months.
I remember I thought, "Well, other Christmas to survive.
So it is."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive, because the mechanism itself what sustains us breathing itself - is what causes cancer, which kills.
Most mezoteliomu cases is caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibres.
When the asbestos fibres and breaches to breathe, they may settle in the pleura, lung suit.
Asbestos fibres irritates the pleura and may cause cell mutation.
"the problem is vdechnutá asbestos fibres in the shape of the needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a heart surgeon who came to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
In the same hospital, where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and is, paradoxically, the head of the center in mezoteliomu treatment.
He knows the Treasure Lawson and treating other patients who were exposed to asbestos probably during practice at the hospital.
The asbestos needles into lung tissue, says Treasure," and "breathing itself is pushing to the edge where the lining.
By its very nature is invasive from the beginning.
The mesothelioma normal treatment options used for other types of cancer so much anymore.
The effectiveness of the operation, for example, is hotly debated.
Some would have stood behind the attempt.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
Get around her scalpel.
The cancer "too does not respond to chemotherapy," which "has some effect," but not treated.
"Sometimes there is someone who will survive lung cancer," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients are living much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years since the diagnosis of his own Graham Abbott still fighting.
After finding the mezoteliomu Abbott contact with Andrew Lawson, four years after his diagnosis, he became an adviser for the same individual and support disabled people.
When they called cheerfully introduced himself: "Hello, you have reached a cancer center."
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
His illness was diagnosed four years ago, and was still very active.
At the outset, Abbott offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which lasted for four months, and probably would only prolong his life on the moon.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give it up.
Lawson but "could show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Loic Lang-Lazduskim professor of the department of thoracic surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage that I didn't have to wait for me to send him, but I just call them and they see me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to make a claim, and he had to approve the payment.
In order to be able to get the best treatment available, it is crucial for patients with mesothelioma, a question of money.
But when different treatment inevitably fail, many patients facing other financial worries - the future of the family leave here.
And, therefore, is turning to the courts, and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"since 1898, it is known that asbestos is harmful," Morgan says.
In the 1960s, but also found that his very small quantities can pose a health risk.
And here we are with corporate negligence.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital deal at the end of the day, but it was "full compensation," according to Morgan because Lawson could not definitively prove that mesothelioma was as a result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
After the investigation of the case, however, Guy's Hospital spokesman confirmed that "asbestos in the basement of the part was deleted in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Blame deadly asbestos exposure to one company or place of work - usually for dozens of years after it happened - is seeking compensation for patients with mesothelioma proved to be a huge problem.
A lot of former workplaces changed hands or go bankrupt.
Insurance is lost.
And those who now defends accusations have time on their side, which is definitely not their applicants.
In response to this important new legislation approved this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma seek compensation, even if it is not possible to trace their former employer.
The law created 350 million-dollar financial reserve, which are paid by insurance companies and is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos, but not to sue anyone.
In this case the disability get 80% of the amount that they would in a normal case gives the court as a settlement - approximately 120,000 pounds.
Each year, 300 successfully introduced applications are expected.
Andrew Morgan as well as patients with mesothelioma thinks that 350 million pounds is "good work."
"It is the agreement drafted insurance for insurance companies," he says, and points out that the sum is a quarter of what the insurance companies would have to pay if they hit the time and people with mesothelioma would have been able to sue a former employer and the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, former minister of labor and social affairs, said that the law "loopholes."
But Penning Morgan also concede that swift action was necessary due to the seven deaths each year.
"too many people are suffering and need help now," he said during the second reading of the law concerning mezoteliomu Penning in December of last year.
Graham Abbott was under the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunskiho 19 months.
After initial consultations recommended Lang-Lazdunski operation, of which, unlike Tom Treasura thought it had a positive effect.

Patients can see it all the time.

She said that friends and suddenly we started to call a lot of people.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose the leadership - protesters promising revenge
In spite of the Chinese parliament's discussions on democratic reform on Sunday decided to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the elections in 2017.
It is likely that this step will cause the long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began to organize and to prepare for a few hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to surrender any candidate who is loyal to Beijing.
"While we weren't surprised, but we made it," she said zákonodárkyně Emily Lau, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They lie to the people in Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
The defense of the Chinese decision, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei said that allow public nominations in Hong Kong's leadership elections would cause "chaos."
The administration of Hong Kong since 1997, when Britain returned to China, Beijing promised that from 2017 onwards, the people will choose the executive branch.
Chinese leaders have presented Sunday of the decision as a democratic breakthrough, because it allows Hong Kong a direct vote, but also clearly shows that Chinese leaders are kept firmly in the hands of the process of the nominations committee, which is tightly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause will přípustní only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong."
The decision came after the summer months, which have seen some of the largest and most of the protests in Hong Kong for several years.
The movement is behind most pro-demokratických protests in Hong Kong Okupace Central with peace and love, whose organizers threatened by the financial district, where Beijing granted universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters Okupace movement gathered in the rain in front of the headquarters of the government of Hong Kong.
The demonstration organizers told that their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that the wave of protests in the coming weeks.
Did not provide any further details, however, clearly wanted to avoid trouble with the authorities.
In its Internet statement, the organizers said that the movement would "consider the occupation of Central only as a last step, in the event that will run out of all the possibilities of dialogue and have no other choice.
We regret to announce that today have exhausted all avenues of dialogue and the cast of Central is inevitable.
The authorities in Hong Kong to Beijing on notice for days and prepared Sunday to strengthen the protection of the seat of government and deployed police and barricades.
Inciting unrest, according to many of the people of Hong Kong, is a sign that slowly loses control of the city.
The flood of people from the mainland increased competition in the field of products and services.
Fears are growing that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are the increasing pressure from Beijing bent.
Some people criticise Okupace movement of Central and say that their demonstrations threaten Hong Kong's trade - the lifeboat.
"protest, they are talking about, could cause more economic damage, depending on how many people are involved, and for how long," says the politician Regina Ip, who criticises the movement in the long term.
We don't want to spread fears that Hong Kong gets out of control.
Such a perception could damage the investment.
Chinese state media also came with the news in recent days, which portrays the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, to which came 780 000 participants - more than a fifth of the electorate in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-demokratických demonstrations in the history of the area.

League in Jihlava carries the name under the political movement
A soccer game in the city of the Highlands Regional Court approximately 1 600 amateur athletes.
And their top competition for the newly appointed Together Jihlavu League.
The name given by one of the movement, which goes into October's municipal elections.
A LOT on his list is, moreover, a small football boss in Jihlava Mráka Jan.
"was the General Assembly, where there was no problem with this," said Mráka.
The situation around the first little league football is already engaged lawyers jihlavské hall and advised to change the distribution system of subsidies.
Five-a-side football won last year, according to the Web site of the city of about a million crowns.
This year, as well as to the amount of the hundreds of thousands.
According to legal opinion is not a small football procedure in violation of the law or government directives.
But the situation is an incentive for the adjustment to the rules governing the allocation of grants and subsidies for office," said government spokesman Radek Tulis.
Draw a subsidy from the city and at the same time express support in the election of one political party like a football, it won't work.
The "big" vysočinský football a similar request from the politicians didn't have yet.
That would be incurred ČSSD ODS division of the county championship or KDU-ČSL 1.
And the class and similar competition?
I wouldn't have to.
On the contrary, I would like to contact us from corporate sponsors," said the president of the county Miroslav Vrzáček football association.
The boss of a small football won't let other parties and movements to the league title
According to a small football players would have deserved this sport in Jihlava area with six of their own playground, showers and bathroom.
"The Stoupách playground, for example, is not ours, we're there in the rental of the club," said Ondřej Lapeš Starlet Jihlava.
Český mill would be the most appropriate site.
But there will be built, for example, in my opinion, absurd campus for skateboarders, which is about fifty in Jihlava," said Mráka.
The Mayor of Jihlava Vymazal Jaroslav ODS responded that uses a small soccer field with artificial grass Rošického and The Stoupách, which are in the property in the streets of the city.
We want to build a golf course, which have a maximum use.
We're modernising or the construction of sports facilities in schools, which will be available in the afternoon.
I think that, for a small soccer has made huge progress in the last few years," he added Vymazal.
The other political parties in the naming of leagues do not appear under Jana Mráky.
We have limitations.
If someone from one sector to the partnership comes to us, so the other was not there," he said.
"political movement in the name of the league, it seems, at least for the unfortunate step," said Charles Voldán the town board member for sport.
"Let but voters assess whether Mr. Mráka uses Little League soccer Jihlava and city subsidies for political purposes, or not," he added.
The American tradition into university life - freshmen may fly jet
We are pleased that we can respond to demand the launch of the first luxury travel services for students in Britain.
For the purpose of leaving the best impression on arrival at the university offers the company also transport options including private jets or the type of Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin cars or McLaren P1.
Stewart also said that the service also has its security page.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to carry your stuff across the state in dangerously loaded the car.
We look forward to that with our vif very important fresher - a very important freshman variants students this year, we will ensure that the university would arrive with a minimum of nervousness and a peak of luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that whereas the service was launched, yet have no reservations, but added: "the students begin to make a reservation during the next few weeks."
The company also said that although students pay annual tuition fees of £9,000, the service is expected to find its place in the market.
In comparison with the students before ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today's students are others in terms of expectations and desires - is more important than ever to make a good first impression and the programme vif is exactly the appropriate way to accomplish that.
The National Union of students but criticised the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, vice-president of the Union for higher education, said: "such a project is unattainable for most students.
A lot of students who enter college this month, thousands of pounds for something as simple as this must be thrown out before he arrived on campus, to cope with the financial crisis, because the financial aid in the form of loans and grants available cannot keep pace with the rising cost of basic needs.
After the events in Fergusonu feminists oppose racism and the behavior of the police
At the beginning of the month, an unarmed man killed a policeman in Fergusonu in Missouri.
Everyone's waiting for the funeral with his hands in the air, chanting: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Fergusonu in Missouri for shooting an unarmed youth Michael Brown, noted blogger Miriam Zoila Perézová shift in online discussions of white feminists.
Finds that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and equality of income, prefer white feminists sex before the race.
The growing tension in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perézová noted that the reaction of the white women in 100% focused on the race.
Compared with the responses black women soon after the shooting on August 9 with personal articles with titles like "thought white women over Ferguson" or "feminism is not just about oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But, according to Perézové, it represents an important change.
"I think that in the feminist movement is not too many people who would talk about race and privileges at such a level," she said.
People felt that to respond to what happened.
It is typical for the crisis that we are facing, because [the situation] Fergusonu racist is so pronounced that had to draw on it.
According to Professor of English at the State University in Ohio Korithy Mitchell by Ferguson in the light of the problems which Afroameričanky must face every day, and in the cultural sphere are perceived as "women's issues."
"I can publish funny stories of life on Facebook with my partner and it gets 150 liků from people from all over the world," said Mitchell.
When I write something about that colored people are trapped in their own country, this silence is deafening.
"How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about relationships, but not on the safety of the public space?" she asked.
For a black woman is Mitchell, which dealt with the issue of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is the dichotomy between the issues of race and gender.
A black woman, according to her, not the luxury clearly split these problems: Live every day in this mixed reality.
Although white women today the issue of race and gender in feminist circles mainstreamových merging, Angela Hatteryová, professor of a women's issue and gender studies lecturer at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890 was at least 10 000 lynčováno blacks and the reason was that in almost all cases of rape white women," said Hatteryová.
You need to justify the lynching cooperation white women.
According to Hatteryové schism between white women and black women came as a fighter for the electoral law as Susan B. Anthony explore the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that the electoral law may have only one group of people - women or blacks.
"the cards have decided to bet on the right to vote for women and the right for blacks to focus at a later date," said Hatteryová.
When we do this, we will have an important insight on why běloškám believes women of color.
Not for the way we have done a good job.
We never did černoškám to protect their spouses and children.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years before women began to organize against the lynching in the Southern Association for the Prevention of lynching.
The group was founded 40 years after he first told the negress for help.
Under Mitchell's surge of white feminists in response to questions, brought about by events in Fergusonu - the question of police conduct, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists have "catching up" the issues faced by the negress generation.
"Wouldn't it be great if [traditional] feminism activists on these areas to take the right to raise the child as seriously as they have the right to contraception?" raised Mitchell.
The second wave feminists, who made a career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraception, now find what it means.
A major feminist activist Gloria Steinem take two weeks after Michael Brown's shooting attack Facebook, where Rebecca Carrollové published a column from The Guardian, which demanded that white Americans more forcefully protested against racism.
"I hope that women are different, but similar reasons for the understanding of the danger in society - and views on race, which differ significantly in the polls - will seek to change," wrote Steinemová.
Although Steinemová takes intersekcionální feminism, which includes the issues of race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America some people confuse.
An expert from the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommersová, author of the book "Who stole feminism?," said the young men in the United States, especially the young, She The People of Color men, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but notes Steinemové parties Fergusonu facing criticism, which has previously.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost none for the boy.
But when the White House began a programme My Brother's keeper, which should help the vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it brought in many feminists, including Gloria Steinemové angry reactions.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that comes to the fore mainstreamového feminism.
After the American border police arrested this year in the southwest of the country nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors, once again, the question of the reform of immigration laws - this time as a woman's issue.
Andrea Mercadová, Co-Chair We Belong Together, an organization of mobilising women for a reform of immigration laws, said that in order to raise the question as necessary for women, all she had to do was to share stories of immigrant women.
"speak for themselves," says Mercadová.
Given that the majority of the work permit is granted to men, women, that come with them, find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable, in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories are in women's organisations in the response," she said.

It is the high temperature, and the risk that the car caught fire, would be great.
Can't afford it.
You've got five speed tests at full pace.
What you should think of them?
Very good.
I felt like when I was young.
We were fast, but I didn't go over Vint.
Everything was caused by a car we piplali was more than half a year to some level.
The race showed that we did.
You drove him, so that you could realistically aspire to the victory.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
The work came to nothing.
On the other hand, the result of which we can aspire to attend.
But it's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one of the top prematurely resigned from the leadership struggle.
Out of him and foreign favoriti Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
You surprised that so many favorites withdrawal?

How have you been satisfied with his performance?

It was the second time.
But Mira confirmed that the car, we've done well.
He went very quickly.
Exactly a year ago, you announced the end of his career, yet you have appeared at the start of 2010 rally.
Can you feel good from the ride back to do a regular participant rallyových factories?
Not at this moment.
I said last year that Barumka is my last race and I failed it anyway.
I decided to take it again.
It was my nineteenth start here, and next year will be the chance, I go into it.
But think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just for you.
You was pleased?
To a certain extent, we took off just because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, asked all the time if I go.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumce?
The team shall continue.
Go to Vyškova, where Robert Adolf will race next week.
I hope that the car is very damaging.

An oral agreement with the employer may be a problem.
Unfortunately, you didn't post from the doctor's certificate of incapacity, which serve as evidence for the organization, that you can't perform professional duties for health reasons.
Moreover, the absence of you immediately announced an employer.
Consequently, there has been an agreement that the days will be recorded as a holiday, but the agreement was only orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to keep writing to confirm the employer with the drawdown of holiday, in practice, the process worked.
If only the oral agreement, you don't have an agreement on the confirmation.
Later may be denied the alleged agreement with the drawdown of holiday, as well as in your case, and the absence of a long-term relationship work in unauthorised absence, hence the reason for the immediate withdrawal of the employment relationship under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the case of a dispute about the employer you so no provable evidence.
The working relationship with you but not cancelled pursuant to Section 53, only the days have shown in zápočtovém sheet as the absence.
The unauthorised absence in zápočtovém sheet does not have the same consequences as Section 53, such as the inability to receive physical security in unemployment, it's still ztížená the possibility of finding a new job.
We recommend you visit the doctor again and have confirmed in writing that actually occurred as a result of the accident, which you are not a so-called "sick leave" was the work of an incompetent, it is only a proof of a doctor.
In the search for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate to issue a written medical certificate of incapacity, as well as of early notice employers or request written consent with the drawdown of holiday.
The mass of potential complications.

Of course we improved improvised caulking around pipes and pumps.
In the cellar, we noticed but strange things.
The sticky package with some, lay on the ground.
Or so it seemed.
And on another.
Now it looked like oslintaná mouse.
In the ceiling, in places where there are vents, grandfather's invention, were the remains of the fish!
And heavily jeté!
Our cellar is quirky, too.
Some would say that Grandpa simply dig the cabin.
And he wouldn't have been so far from the truth.
The walls and floor is just packed sand, only the ceiling is podbitý.
They are mostly ships.
And the wheels.
And of the deck chairs on the beach.
The door is wide open spaces were for the most part, as someone went there in one piece.
Several already mentioned vents in the ceiling.
Without the network, so there normally zalétávají birds build nests in the rafters.
The mouse is unnecessary to mention.
Grandpa luftovalo wanted to do it, and do it again.
Now, however, help or chopped flarn.
The whole basement smelled.
We cleaned all the basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nourishing!
We also threw things that have been around: Boards, heraklitovou board, and so on.
Our cabin at a distance greeted passers-by with perfume.
We wondered who those disgusting remnants could drag us there?
The nearest cat lives two miles away in the village.
Hardly svačit would come to us.
A man was attacked by a neighbor, who is not quite right.
If those of us on the Frant nastiness nešoupnul air there?
There is practically the entire year, stupid ideas, that he has.
We decided to watch the cellar and well and regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
The water we started using again, so far only on and washing, than the tests will be done, but it was good.
Pull water from the springs of the forest is not anything I wanted to do something for a long time.
Once we heard our terrible anguished barking dogs.
Mom looked down from the balcony and saw a strong black hose in the grass beside the porch.
Reza bounced over her and screeching like crazy.
Mom scolded her, because she thought that Reza out waste hose from the sink.
But suddenly the hose smotala part into a ball and partially straightened up.
On the balcony heard the hiss.
Reza was in hysterics.
We went down.
Snake, a lot of four feet long and thick as býkovec, was about to swallow a toad and Reza defended her in it.
It was not clear if she wanted to save the toad, or if it wanted to eat alone, but that was irrelevant.
When she saw one viper odds in the form of our entire family, he said, whatever you eat it, when we were hladi, and stretched gracefully through the air shaft into the basement.
We went for it.
Like lightning jumped as well.
Just by the way we have seen another smelly package on its board.
According to smell like fish.
The day before yesterday wasn't there!
Our new security around the pump was a bit wonky.
And we lock the basement during the day.
That would.................................................
We went out there and we all fell to vent.
We didn't expect a long time.
The wells that the mantelpiece.
First appeared flat head with yellow marigolds on his neck.
Then the whole snake swung to a well.
Wrapped around the pumps and began to conquer inside.
A staff member to take revenge, bought the company laptops and sold them
Emotionally wounded employee after the release, the computer firm bought and then sold them.
Money to spend time before the detention by the police.
A man in a short period of time he bought a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns in 12 cases.
"laptops after taking away in Olomouc, where it is sold at the bazaar," said Rostislav Bruckner šumperské police Chief Commissioner.
The motive of the fraud was revenge employers for the release of money and profit.
"in the hearing of us claimed that he used the money to loan repayments," said Bruckner.
Police also found that a fraud is a pathological gambler who repeatedly treated in the psychiatric ward.
So the money could end up in the lottery machines or videoloterijních terminals also.
"The fact is that we didn't find any money for him," the commissioner said.
Fraudster, who had already been punished for theft, now threatens the duration of one to five years in prison.
The police have yet to tell whether the penalty also bazarům laptops under price bought and sold them on.
It is true that silenced completely new goods, which is a minimum of the suspect," the commissioner said.
None of the owners of the bazaar, however, has not been charged.
Come on, a bit more, you can do it or how I enjoy We Run Prague
This year, organizers made several changes to us.
The biggest thing was the route change, which brought the target on the river wall, instead led back to Žlutých spa.
I enjoyed the race along with the rest of the team Rungo.cz, I was going to him but to spend a little bit from the other side.
With the whole team we decided to personally greet our readers at the newsstand where we collectively took pictures and video cameras.
To get their view from the other side to perfection, I accepted the role of personal conductors.
Together with a friend Katia just before the launch, we dutifully placed at the end of the corridor of 60 to 70 minutes.
We greeted with friends, who walked around us into the sector for faster runners.
Had a lot of time left.
A couple of cronies to warm up, turn sporttestery countdown and launch!
Shouts of jubilation, but instead of fast-start followed scurrying to the starting line.
After five minutes, we reached the gate, engaging the measurement and rozbíháme pace for an hour and ten minutes.
Muddling the yellow snake runners who, like Cath, running his first race.
So far all look fresh, slowly decreasing the sun in the sky adds perspective on Vyšehrad almost gaudy tinge.
The throbbing mass stretching along the quay looks as if the whole Prague ran here.
On the waterfront between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre is traditionally begins, who has many forces.
A slight rise at Palackého náměstí forcing many runners slow or go to a walk.
Just before the přeběhem Theater to see a police escort and right behind him flying Vítek Pavlišta at an incredible rate to target.
I can hear the admiring ufuněné sigh of the other runners.
Moving to the edge of the track, encourage him, about to hit me, but just before me podvrtne leg and our hands to pass close by.
Seběh Theater street gives a chance for a short rest and breathe.
It needs to be, in front of us are the place where my views floored.
Turn on the bridge shows Mánesově Prague in the beauty of the setting sun.
Breathing and my legs bear almost alone.
The moment of truth for the first občerstvovačkou.
When the road was overrun Cath rear on the curb and displays leap gracefully.
I'm looking if he needed help, and launching a series of encouraging words, no time to think about the pain.
The rise and continuing Goat aisle, it is one of the narrowest places along the route, at this stage in the race while there is no longer such a rush, but it is the need to monitor the area.
I don't know that the concept of the closest place gets its true meaning later.
The Prašnou through us frantically encourage tourists as well as with other runners.
I'm trying to clap with anyone who will offer a hand, and do it as well as Katya, because ten clap with fans is like half of energy bars.
It really works, accelerating again and, while we were quite significantly, now a fighter ride began.
Dozens of runners, when passing someone particularly tired of ourselves, trying to cheer him up in a few words: "Come on, a bit more, you can do it!"
No one of us for the last občerstvovačkou nepředbíhá, accelerating.
In the meantime we ran for an hour and a quarter, adding, not on what to expect.
Three kilometers to target will be hurt, but the need is really clean.
The sun's slow down and ended the day symbolically slowly exiting the race.
The last run on the bridge, turn and just straightaway to target.
The pace, which we run, amazes me, where it takes in this girl?
"Come on, let's go under thirteen hour, hustle!" call.
We try, sprint and the objective is here.
Thirteen hour and six seconds.
Well, what I can do.
The coach gave twenty hour limit.
So seven minutes under the plan.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal Katya legs, helping her to the railing, where having a rest.
It show exhaustion, but also of good luck of the exercise.
After a while it slowly pretty out of the goal area.
The euphoria makes us think of the crowd in the dressing rooms.
Here, it can be seen that Goat Lane was the narrowest place.
This is up there with the aim of hanging banks, which is under the onslaught of almost ten thousand runners jam-packed.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it is not the place for him.
And after a while I losing my head and wonder if you are beautiful views and more interesting than in previous years, the route was worth it, what's going on in the objective.
I know from experience that the organisation of the race is no fun.
If rich accompanying programme adds to this ten thousand people, and the conclusion of the whole city centre for all transport, it is a huge challenge.
This year's change routes the runners showed many interesting places, but also has some very unpleasant surprises.
Výborná rozpumpovaná atmosphere in the spa Žlutých transferred among runners in the race itself.
Organizers around the track as well as innocent bystanders ratcheted it on every subway line.
The historic center in the city run unfortunately must reckon with obstacles, which cannot be removed, but the goal of the factory in the place of the river, which is on one side of the wall, and on the other hand, consider the best solution.
If I say that the race had ended proběhnutím aim, judging him as very good.
The goal, I was a little worried about the health of the parties, but in the end, everything has gone well.
Write us into the discussion, if you liked the route and what you say on the situation in the target.
Prison guards in Bulgaria organise protests
Hundreds of employees of the prison service in the whole of Bulgaria took part in a nationwide protest rally in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital city of Sofia.
The peaceful demonstration reiterated its call for the reintroduction of the original working conditions that have changed in recent years.
On the list of requirements, which are to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov, are even higher salaries.
The guards of the month symbolically protested against the new working time and have called for a return to the original twenty four-hour směnám.
Although the unions met the prison guards and officials of the Ministry of Justice, the deal, informed the Bulgarian state radio NBR.
"negotiations are still ongoing," said the NBR Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the Directorate General of the prison service.
Members of the Federation also are expected to join the protests of the prison service employees unions of employees at the Ministry of the Interior.
Why the universe may have multiple dimensions, and we can't see them
Physicists usually write best-sellers, but Brian Greene of Columbia University in 1999 managed a bull's-eye.
His book The Elegant Universe became the most accessible to non-specialists way through the thicket of problems, which are now dealing with a series of theoretical physicists - an attempt to unite two great functioning, but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: The theory of general relativity and quantum theory.
One of the causes of success Elegantního space, no doubt, is that, in the case of the search for the unified theory of physics is not a boring story.
The basic problem between the two key theories for the physicists at the moment is our universe de facto divided into two worlds with different laws faced and resolved so imaginatively, that it's worth retelling even to the layman.
Greene had also advised the complex material so fresh, and that one cannot blame him, how much interest in his books included.
In addition, correct its "mistake" for the most part in the other two books: The structure of the universe and the hidden reality.
Perhaps the author would have objected to that, if his book zastarávala faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years of Elegant Universe is still almost everything important informed layman with the ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the next few years will be needed in this area was a bit more because the accelerator LHC will finally at full throttle," and it is a good time to enter Green peacefully through the open door of the world of modern physics.
Many may have our universe?
The idea that our universe is perhaps more than the three spatial dimensions, of course, it may sound silly, fantastic, strangely, or mystical.
Yet it is specific and perfectly acceptable.
We understand that, while odvraťme his eyes from the universe as a whole to do much, much more practical, specifically to long and thin a garden hose to water.
Imagine that hundred-meter-or-so cock a garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scene from půlkilometrové distance, as the picture and on the following page.
From a distance you easily long horizontal outstretched hose, but if you just bystrozrakostí, the thickness of the hose you barely.
Due to its distance from the hose, one would think that the ant forced to live on the hose is only one dimension, a dimension: Levo-pravý can walk along the hose.
If someone asks you where an ant in the moment, his answer was just one indication: Ant distance from the left or the right end of the hose.
All that we want to say only that of půlkilometrové distance, it looks like a long hose as one-dimensional object.
In the real world the hose has a thickness.
If all of this increase, we suddenly second dimension - in the shape of the circle around the hose.
In the enhanced perspective, it is clear that in fact the ant can move in two dimensions: The already well known levo-pravém dimension along the length of the hose, but also in "dimension in/against a clockwise direction," that is, around kruhovéhoprůřezu hose.
You can begin to understand that to determine the position of the small mravenečka two numbers: How far it is from the end of the hose and where is the circle around the hose.
It reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional Experts perceive that this chapter focuses purely on poruchovou string theory.
Chapter Neporuchové aspects through 12 and 13.
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: One long longitudinal dimension is shown a straight arrow, dimension in the direction of the district, marked with a circular arrow, is short and rolled up.
Between these two dimensions, however, is a clear difference.
The size of the hose is long and easily visible.
Size around the perimeter of the hose is short, "rolled" and less apparent.
In order to realize the existence of the circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates an important characteristic of spatial dimensions.
That is divided into two groups.
May be big, sprawling, and therefore directly visible or, on the contrary, small, coiled and much less noticeable.
In that case, of course, we have just been working much, to "scroll" dimension enveloping discovered the thickness of the hose.
Take it to the aid of a telescope.
However, if the hose was thinner - as a hair or capillary -, curved dimension we discovered with a great deal of effort.
Kaluza sent in 1919 Einstein in his article, which came with a stunning idea, known to all of us that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions.
His radical claim Kaluza justified by providing an additional dimension of elegant and persuasive framework, in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of symbolic items into a single, united conceptual structure.
The question immediately, as far as this observation Kaluzův together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer, quietly assumed that Kaluza between the lines and the clearly expressed and Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein said in 1926, stands and falls with the assertion that the spatial geometry of our universe may be as large, as well as rolled-up dimensions.
It means that our universe has dimension in the direction of the length of the hose as big, sprawling and easily visible in three dimensions, the existence of which we have at any moment.
But by analogy with circular circumference garden hose may have additional dimension of the universe, tightly coiled into space so small that has remained hidden even before our sleekest experimental the.
To get a clearer picture on the substance of the Kaluzova remarkable proposal, let's stay still for a moment in the hose.
Imagine that on the perimeter of the hose draw relatively thick black paint a series of circles.
From a distance the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With binoculars now thanks to expose drawing scroll dimension even easier, we see a theme of Figure 2.
We can see clearly that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one of the great dimensions and almost unlimited and with the second round and short-lived.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension čtyřiprostorovédimenze has three large spatial dimensions, together.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help a little bit of his imagination, spot illustrations on obr.3; two large dimensions and one shows a small circular dimension.
The surface of the hose on the geometry of space in the same way, as we look at the bigger picture.
Each level, the geometry of space represents a huge increase from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimension we see is the fourth zoom level, where they are rolled up into small enough space; that we thought we had them directly detected.
The rectangular grid represents a new dimension, a tiny and scroll commonly known as the "big" dimension, while the circle.
Just as yarn loops in the thick carpet, as well as those of the circle are in any place of the usual proportions - just because we are with graphic vividness plot only to the intersections in the square on the network.
Background image 4 represents commonly known as the fabric of space - the ordinary world around us - in current terms such as a party in a small square in the square meters, the devices on the network.
On each of the following image we focus on a small area of the image of the previous; to increase it to become visible.
Nothing was happening at first, as we see the first few levels increase.
If, however, progress on its way beyond the microscopic properties for the geometry of space - the fourth level, the increase in Figure 3 - we suddenly a new dimension, curved to the shape of the circle, a similar thread loops in densely unwatched piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that there is an additional circular dimension at every point in the direction of the large dimensions like the hose also has a circular area at any point of its length.
In the interest of a circular dimension with graphic vividness plot only in certain, regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 Kaluzovu and Kleinovu summarises the idea on the microscopic structure of the geometry of space.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, though there are also important differences.
Firstly, the universe has three large, echoing the spatial dimensions, only two of which we drew away while the hose has only one big dimension.
The more important difference is that now we are talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just about any object in the universe, be our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If additional ring-shaped coiled dimension is extremely tiny, recognize it is - as well as a circuit of the hose - much harder than watching the obvious, large and sprawling dimensions.
If the size of the extra dimension is small enough to reveal her will, in fact, even over the strength of our modern instruments on enlargement.
But the most important thing is that the additional dimension is a curving ridged within the normal proportions as two-dimensional illustrations mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists in every point three current vast proportions.
It is the size of the remaining three dimensions as independent as they are independent of each other and perpendicular dimensions top-down, zleva-vpravo and zepředu-dozadu.
Small enough mraveneček could move in all four dimensions and four data to determine its position we needed, in addition to the usual three more position in the circular dimension; counting and the time of the data, then five, one more than we would normally expect in any case.

To our surprise, then, that even though we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, shows Kaluzovo and Klein's thinking that this does not preclude the existence of additional sprawled proportions if they are small enough.
The universe may have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should be?
The state-of-the-art technical equipment can detect the structure of a billionth part big feet.
The smaller the rolled-up dimensions as soon as we can see.
In 1926 Klein of the original idea Kaluzův combined with a few ideas from the birth of quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that additional dimension round could have one about the size of the Planck length, size far beyond the resolving power of today's machines.
Since then physicists call the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluzovou-Kleinovou theories.

When you add another string, you can vary the piece again.

Another goal without waiting?
It's not a big celebration, acknowledges their Dvořák
We point and we're happy for him.
The first half we had more chances, the second home," a tale of the attacker, who this time scored pokutového kopu.
You were not in his acting nervous, but it was accompanied by huge boos?
Particularly, when I noticed that, for the second wicket, the home fans, it would be worse.
Penaltou match you after half an hour, but you've already got a goal from the penalty shootout after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We slept in the beginning, we were passive, arose from a corner and then a penalty after it.
After you up and you were the better team in the first half, who had more of a chance.
Why it changed after the break?
Hard to say.
I agree that after inkasovaném goal, we played well until the break.
In the cabin and after we have said that we want to keep up the momentum of the game, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't explain why.
But it is also true that he said something to his game on a break at home, they were not happy with it.
The Cup for the first time you probably scored, while at home you shouldn't even score a goal.
Why is it such a difference?
I don't think it's such a difference, rather depends on us, how to roughhouse with it.
In Brno we started well, but then it was bad, Plzeň from us, it is a different category.
Four games were waiting for you to the goal, you should not fear it may be like after the last match?
Perhaps not, but of course we like that since the last game, we don't have to listen to talk about waiting for the goal.
Now we have added another without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet on the big celebration.
Iceland - the lava flow in from remote kilometers of the crater.
The lava goring to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the glacier Glacier, flowing through an underground tunnel from the remote kilometers of the crater.
That is located under the glacier, as well as part of the underground lava tube.
This fact now scientists concerned about the most.................................................
In the meantime, the situation remains unchanged.
31 yesterday morning.
Still, 2014 jerked around the same amount of lava from fissures.
Compared with the original estimates, however, is its less quantity, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
The previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times greater.
Scientists fear, however, that the lava tube could be open even in places where it is located under the ice.
If that happened, with the addition of similar intensity, which demonstrates the current eruption, it would mean massive flooding, both on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum river and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption is a strong smell of sulphur, rents are rising clouds of steam and gases.
Certainly it is not suitable for tourism, as was the case in the event of an eruption Fimmvörðuháls eruption in 2010.
This is much larger and there is also a lot more gas," says vulkanolog Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, was almost becalmed in the area in the early hours.
Sandstorm tracks have been washed away by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.

Through the wings
Roundup in Berlin.
The typed Boeing Stearman PT-17 presented air acrobat Peggy Walentinová, which climbed from the cockpit during a flight to the bar on the upper wing Biplane and also between the wings.
There is only depends on muscle power.
Roundup in Berlin this year was the fifth time and again, the organizers managed to prepare a couple of interesting pieces.
The premiere of the oldest Czech airport said not only "to walk the wings" in the administration of the German acrobats Peggy Walentinové, but also the legendary fighter P-51 Mustang D or Beechcraft airplane 18.
He tore his attention with a brilliant cover.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking has its origins in the US.
After World War I tried to push through many former military pilots.
But because of the large number of fatalities was prohibited.
Today, but slowly returns to the air days.
Peggy after takeoff climbs out of the cockpit on the upper wing.
There's various exercises.
Toward the end of the show moves into the space between the wings of the aeroplane, where her show continues," described the Chebského Luděk Matějíček Ultralight Club and an organizer of the day.
Her husband is a pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E Friedrich.
If Peggy speech was the main nail, then the following show the Mustang fighters was legendary icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter in the area came with Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic is the so-called hinge on the numbers.
Such a report could see air fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then all showed breathtaking acrobatics with the plane in 1945.
Produced was still in the war, but she probably never did.
He was included in the army reserves.
Since 1963, he worked in the civil sphere.
And as a racing aircraft.
Today is my home airport hangar in Mnichovo Hradiště.
On the same site is also another pearl Chebského air day, twin-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
The airport did not overlook the massive machine.
His polished aluminum coating glowed in the distance.
The machine also earned the admiration of Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colours of the French Air Force.

Lucie thongs: A dramatic return in front of the camera!
Parental worries over Lucie thongs for the evening, at least for those jobs.
The stress or anxiety - blonde presenter none of it obviously doesn't know.
Moderovaní television reports it went well, as if she was with him for two months!
It is only two weeks ago, the blonde ended puerperium, in which women are experiencing the biggest stress after childbirth.
Lucie, however, won't be in the main news session, Nova TV show on a regular basis.
It expects a fair return on the basis of information Blesk.cz until next month.
After all, her daughter Linda now needs more than the television audience.
Lucie thongs returned to the television screen, and it was a bull's-eye.
The exhibit a year in Prague?
The hall's sold-out, is planning a bachelor party Jágr
It would be decent, if such a thing was done during the World Cup.
But it does, how to stand up to the Soviet Union," Gold said in Jihlava named after the exhibition match, in which the team's impressive naganský met again.
Even the players who participated in the golden hattricku.
The players should feel like that?
I'm sure of it.
It would be good to do a farewell with a golden generation during the World Cup.
According to me they find one for two days during the tournament, which is a full day off and where to insinuate that match.
We say that such Šlégrovi Gumovi or Béďovi Ščerbanovi organizer Jihlava game, who would take it in charge.................................................
The arena would be sold out.
But what if you play with New Jersey playoffs?
So when you fly.................................................
Play in entertainment, but you don't want to.
Or jihlavské meeting somehow modify your decision?
Team and an exhibition match are two different things and are crucial in the entertainment performance.
There is one thing that I would like to see people, but the performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
There should drive the players, who are on it, and not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How do you actually take that naganské reunion?
It's just a meeting with the players was great.
You recall stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was an honor Ivan Hlinkovi.
And it is good to remind the history of our game and that leaves one generation, which was worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimir Ruzicka and Peter Čechmánek on the sidelines.
He still do his first representative match?
For such things to remember.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three young: I, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we got in the same threesome.
It was the first representative for all start.
Well, but that we dominated in some way, so that I can tell.
Dominik Hašek caught in Jihlava after a long period of time.
What did you say to his performance?
Hašan never surprises me on the ice.
I wanted to bring it back to him with the criticism, but I can't Hašek criticised, for the reasons why he decided to end up in the entertainment .Zachytal just fine.
Even the Hnilička brilliantly demonstrated.
While he was with me one night practicing and there was full of holes.
And now the capital.
The US first and then the Netherlands, soccer team's qualification
The NH Hotel smíchovskému on Monday morning were prominent guests.
People can see the need of Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Čech reprezentačního trainer Paul Willow.................................................
And there, it is the figure in black tee-shirts, Tomáš Rosický!
The quarterback and the team captain and Arsenal arrived at eleven-thirty among the last.
We have a beautiful game against the Netherlands.
Who would have looked forward to?" he said, speaking in representative kit before journalists.
The programme of the Czech team
Monday, September 1: The beginning of a reunion, the first training session
Tuesday 2 September: Practice open for fans of 18: 30, Letná autographing, 20: 00.
Wednesday 3 September the Czech Republic - the US 20: 15, Letná
The Czech Republic - The Netherlands on Tuesday, 9 September 20: 45, Letná end reunion
Rosického and company can support the fans before Wednesday's game against the US 20: 15.
Team for them was opened Tuesday's training session, which begins on Letná at 18: 30.
And it will be followed by the autographing Rosický nor the Czech will miss him.
Otherwise, though, this reunion of the national team will be calmer.
Which he says coach Willow, who complained about the amount of social events in the spring.
Finally, we're going to do what we want to do.
We will now concentrate on the Netherlands.
It is an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We have time to rehearse things now so much time there," said Willow, who leads the official national team since January.
The Czech national football team will accompany the entry of new qualifying cycle mušketýrská image.
The team has three games under Willow behind him, all preparatory.
With Austria losing 1 and Norway and Finland remizovala 2: 2: 2.

It until now.
Indeed, the match with the Netherlands will start the procedure for the 2016 European Championship qualifications.
The Czech team would help, of course, if the overhaul could handle against the US.
The first half was, in order to meet.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about it, in order to be successful," Willow said.
The only player třiadvacetičlenné nominations, who has health problems, the assailant is David Lafata.
The temperature was bothering him.
If it doesn't heal into Wednesday's match against the US, coach Willow would summon one attacker.
Genetic disorders are often poorly diagnosed
The woman from Britain, describing how many years after a bad diagnosis thought that he would die.
After he was diagnosed with the disease, Karin Rodgersová spent most of her adolescence in the belief that only a few years of life.
In fact it was the Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome CMT - a group of inherited disorders, which adversely affects nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
CMT UK charities stated that the wrong diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because she knows very little about the disease.
It is considered that in the United Kingdom, approximately 23 000 people suffering from CMT, which may show motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, clumsy gait and curled toes.
For those with disabilities may occur as well as numbness or pain, this condition is curable and progressive, which means that over time, the symptoms are deteriorating.
When he was thirteen Rodgersové, thought that they suffer from Freidreichovou ataxia FA - the disease, which has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that, than to celebrate your 18th birthday, she will be in a wheelchair, and dead, than it will be thirty.
The mother of two children, which is now 51, says: "I knew as a child that I can't do the same things as the rest.
Every day I fell and it took me longer.
I never could roller-skate with other children, or on a skateboard, and in the school bully me because of what I did and run."
When he was thirteen Rodgersové and was after several operations, which should release her Achilles tendon and straighten the soles of his feet, took advantage of the fact that her doctor left the room, and peered into its documentation, where she learned that he is suffering from the FA.
"I felt guilty, because I'm the Tracker, and so I didn't tell anybody, but when I returned home, I had sought information about the disease in the library and I wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When I came back, I was in shock, I was completely panicked.
I thought before I'm 18, I end up in a wheelchair, and will be twenty-five than me, I will be dead, and in the meantime gradually lose all their skills.
I was all alone and I planned my funeral."
When she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk, not as much as expected, and asked that his surgeon.
Just stood up, put his arm around her and said, "Honey, I don't think you have the disease, otherwise you already was in a wheelchair.
I think it will be something much less life-threatening."
After graduating from several genetic tests revealed that she had CMT.
"When I explained what the CMT is, I thought, I'm a lucky guy," she said.
CMT UK charities launch awareness month on CMT, the attention to this disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington area: With a turnover of the economy to raise taxes
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes, too.
According to a new survey, which was published last week, state and local corporate taxation has increased slightly in the country with a faster rate of recovery of the economy last year, and the firm in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia together for the fiscal year 2013 to state and local coffers have done 27,6 billion dollars, which is the amount of 3.8% higher than $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden - national and local - the last year rose by 4.3% to $671 billion compared with 3.9% last year and growth was the third year in a row after the years 2009 and 2010, when the tax decrease.
According to the study carried out by a professional firm Ernst & Young and political groupings Center on State Taxation, the state tax increase faster than the 4.3%, local contributions of 3.9%.
More than half of the district, 56% tax revenues, is from Maryland's business tax, and 36% of revenue from the companies.
Virginia, with 28%, has the smallest proportion of the tax revenue from business.
The researchers say that a majority share of the growth of tax revenue comes from the increase in the value of real estate firms, which property taxes this year after three consecutive years with the growth of -1% increase of 3.7%.
Although most of the profit comes from large states like California, New York and Texas, it seems that the situation is the same in Washington as well.
The company in D.C., Maryland and Vriginii last year paid over $10 billion for state and local property taxes, which represents an annual increase of 4.2% compared with 9.6 billion in 2012.
The apparent increase in the value of real estate, however much hindrance to the top state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the estate tax represents less than one-fifth of company taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C. real estate tax represents almost half of the state and local taxation.
"in Maryland owns a lot of real estate firms, particularly the tax base in the D.C. area, the government or a non-profit organization, which doesn't pay taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the Center on State Taxation.
So, Maryland, for example, is forced to rely much more on income tax, to pay for the same services, which are in other countries.
The recent increase in tax revenue from business cannot be attributed only to uzdravujícímu in the real estate market.
According to the data, it seems that the revenue from business is also growing.
Companies in the region to make corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, which has increased from 2.1 billion from 2012.
Maryland chose one billion dollars in taxes on corporate income, the most in the region.
Although move in the same direction, the local tax burden in the business community is growing as rapidly in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C., Maryland was at the level of the national average, at 4.3%, while growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia, an increase in taxation was below average at 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest of all three districts, all of which have the same taxation of corporate taxation, 6%.
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the average D.C. remains relatively high, at 9,975%.
A similar study carried out by the American Chamber of Commerce in this year showed that Virginia has a lower state and local taxation and generally more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. study value.
Despite this advantage, Virginia is facing the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law lowering company tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year, the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state in the coming year will continue to meet revenue targets, in 2017 could reduce the statutory income tax rate to 3%.
According to a recent study of small businesses in Washington is doing better, and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
The business tax levied small-scale entrepreneurs as a personal income tax - the structure of compensation cost increases by raising prices, according to which it is organised most companies - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia last year increased by 20% to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers say the trend and national business tax increase is likely to continue next year, the total tax revenue from the sale of state and local governments in the first three quarters of the year compared to the same period in the previous year increase to 6.2% in 2014.
Washington may, however, lags behind the rest, because the reduction in public spending is taking its toll on the labour market.

Joan family suspect: "rooting"
Joan Rivers is in a coma for three days, ever since it was brought to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter is now expressed, that does not lose hope that jednaosmdesátiletá komička recover.
"Thank you for your love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
Holding her thumb.
Her mother brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to rescue service, under which occurred in her cardiac arrest on the Upper East Side yorkwillské endoscopy, the source said.
Her doctors deliberately kept sedated and under close supervision, while not sure of her condition, which remains "serious."
The reaction came before long and that including the incredible support on the Internet from celebrities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
The reality is překrucovaná headlines
That the media with headlines distort reality, not, unfortunately, no news.
I know that the headlines "sell" newspaper, but I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And it is a fact that worries me very much lately, is rather more apt word angry.
This particularly applies to articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines are quite normal" Israel attacked Gaza."
Only in the text to read that Israel's "attack" was issued in response to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, and often in the time of the ceasefire.
It then get the headline: "Both sides have violated the ceasefire."
The journalistic community realizes that this procedure is directly involved in the anti-Semitic attitudes throughout Europe, and not only there are increasing?
Less than sixty years since the end of World War II.
Yet there are people who survived the Shoah.
When I saw the video of the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted slogans "Jewish swine" and similar zhůvěřilosti, chilled me.
It wants the world to finish what Hitler did not succeed?
Our journalists aware of the fact that the Jews were destined for disposal Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take more care of their work.
You are often called "watchdogs of democracy."
So her obhajujte.
As long as there is.
And obhajujte a truly democratic state in the Middle East, as well as the right to protect its population.
How would you like to preserve our government, if one of our neighbours decided that the Czech nation has been wound up and the Czech Republic erased from the map of the world?
Maybe you should also recognize one more fact.
Living on the territory of the State of Israel almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship.
And is there for them as well.
When you ask them why they don't go between "their," to the Gaza Strip, the answer to you, why would they do that?
They have work, social security, and the peak of health care in Israel itself, I saw with my own eyes how to top private Hadassa hospital, which is financed by the sponsorship of the Jews from all over the world, normally goes both Arabs and are treated there, of course.
Hamas with missile attacks on its Arab brothers as well.
The only real aid to Gaza, and thus this troubled area, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm him.
And not to condemn Israel, albeit indirectly, in the headlines.
Talk about the practices of Hamas, about his abuse of people as human shields.
Talk about the fact that Hamas has the objective to destroy the state of Israel, at any price.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Talk about the fact that Hamas is on the list of the world's terrorist organizations.
Talk about that for nine years in Gaza this area could be thriving thanks to humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity, for which, of course, does not apply to the administrator of Gaza and even angry at this time, that are sometimes disrupted power supply.
If Hamas has invested the money into the construction of the underground tunnels so they can penetrate suicide attackers on the territory of Israel, but to the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals and schools, lived his Arab brothers from Gaza would be much better.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed the allegations Information from Monday morning: An online retailer - the producer of videos and hundreds of other things - buying Twitch for $970 million to $1.04 billion streamingovou video service.
The announcement caused surprise not because no one would expect that someone buys Twitch, but because it was expected that the buyer will be YouTube.
Three months before the sale of Google for one billion Twitche looked certain, and this seemed like a natural.
Justin.tv Twitch, who founded only three years ago, he was primed to become widely used video streamingovou service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, he has quickly become a platform for the player, who broadcast on her online coverage of the games - in the words of Business Insider" YouTube for live streaming games."
Interaface Twitche.
"Let's play," the species are already popular videos on YouTube, where mostly older mudrlanti give games processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube popisuTwitche comes up a lot, so the news that YouTube kupujeTwitch, anyone too much emotion, it was a textbook example of how the company pays off potential competition.
The mystery is why the agreement with YouTube didn't work, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
Everything that we currently have available, is the expression of CEO Twitche Emmet Sheara: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our society, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us do it faster."
Another mystery is - frankly - Twitche incredible success.
For snobs like me, who argue that they are doing the sport better than watching, it is hard to understand what is so wonderful about watching the game instead of just playing.
It is one thing to look at three in the morning a friend over his shoulder as he plays Resident Evil, and quite another thing is to watch somebody else gets 20 hits to the head in Call of Duty.
All of the games that you could just watch.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so look at their record, without you could control their own perspective, it's a pretty good recipe, how do you get a headache.
I admit that the game of speed run, in which Rogeři Bannisteři completes our electronic age in record time, the game is fun.
But if someone is a master at playing or humor, his channel Twitch probably will be very interesting.
But what about the sceptics as I know?
Twitch's 55 million visits a month and is fourth at the top of Internet traffic.
Exactly how it will use Amazon?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch vmíchá into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it would have been able to swallow YouTube.
But Twitch has something that would like to draw any firm: The hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As the director said Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch "believes in the future of the games" and the media do, that would be reluctant, even as - gulp - viewers.
The second basic lie creationism.
Another English translation of the American atheist vloggera Aron Ra.
This time the theme "Holy fonts are the word of God."
Accompanied by the original video.
The second lies creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not the actual human authors.
When religious debate on one of the many things that are in conflict with their religion, often facing us question: Who do you trust?
Alleged God's word, or the word of a man?
As if human exploration was completely trivial compared with what authority they have their doctrine.
But when they say "you," is talking about science.
And when the relentless "the word of God," the relentless myths about God registered people.
If there is indeed an intelligent with the lifebringer with a purpose, then it is he who created a fossil record reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be the guy who invented the genetic patterns, which are responsible for her, and it must be him, who added a further series of evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things existed?
It seems as if he were trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulovat.
And they were the people who wrote all those texts, to pretend that they are the word of God.
Each allegedly holy teachings of any religion in the world, describes itself as a human beings, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" their favorite gods, or should be listening to the dictates of angels, but those lyrics were written by anyone other than the mere mortals with some degree of imagination, not angels and no gods.
If one true god actually existed, he would have been an integral part of all the gods of all religions, über-galaktický rocket scientist, the ultimate entity of the entire space.
If a creature of such magnitude ever wrote a book, there would only be one such book, only scripture.
She would have known all over the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because the mere human authors could be measured with such work.
And people should not blindly trust her, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and featuring a deep morality and wisdom is far higher than any human limits.
Permanently would inspire each reader to the unity of the common faith.
If God wrote it, we would expect nothing less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without a common origin and all are constantly fall apart on increasingly separate denomination, seeking the disputed the truth and each claiming divine leadership in some way, regardless of the ongoing divergence and separation in each direction.
The Jewish Torah, Christian Gospels, the Islamic Quran, Baha'u'llah's lláhův Kitáb-i-Akdás Zarathuštrovy the Avesta, of the Sikhs Adí-Granth Mahabharátská Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or Urantia Book are all considered "absolute right" and "the revealed word of the one true God, and believers of every one of them say that the others are on the wrong path.
Probably the only logical explanation is that the cast are all to some extent.
None of the books mentioned above have no advantage over the others.
None of them has no evidential basis and no can't confirm historically.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I'm not saying that I could, that the Bible is reliable and historical accuracy.
Of course, that is not the case.
I still have faith.
All of them require faith and apologia for the defence, because they contain irregularities, absurdity and primitive ideas once regarded as true, which have already been overcome.
So you cannot say that they are a proof of divine wisdom.
Many of these advocates of hideous atrocities instead of morality, and many of them say that they have been confirmed by the fulfilment of a prophecy - each with that too may contain prophecy that has been fulfilled.
Prominent theologians concede that all of the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and therefore are subject to interpretation, impressions and views their primitive and often prejudices tied politically motivated authors, thereby explain many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
That's what I would call the contradictions, more mutual comments.
We must point out, once again, that we have two different authors, whose work was somehow mixed together during some redaktorské revision.
The truth is that it has more than one author of Genesis, and certainly not an eyewitness story!
Some experts now identified four different sources for the Pentateuch, or Five Books of Moses," and only nepřipisují authorship of any of them, because almost certainly existed as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that the Genesis has been lodged probably Ezdrášem from several mutually unrelated oral traditions of less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered in that same time, and all of them are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
Dead Sea Scrolls are ancient archaeological findings texts known for its unfinished basis all Western monotheistic faiths, and yet are younger than the roots of many centuries zoroastriánství, Buddhism, Hinduism, helénismu, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as gnostická faith, followed docéti and ebionité and their different views on Jesus, which will eventually be combined in some kind of compromise on orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups like luciferiáni other revisions of the Bible were scattered and discredited.
One of these rig Ugaritu refers to the king, who ruled over 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers represented a major threat to young mojžíšké religion, the New Testament authors decided to mock and Baal Zebula," Lord on the mountain" changed to Beelzebub "Lord of the Flies."
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently amended from religious leaders, as well as for political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Law was canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of komisních Nikaji council decisions.
The four Gospels was adopted and sixteen others were rejected by a show of hands, as if the fact gave some things to accept or reject the vote.
The manner in which the canon has depended on what they read in the then Christian centers on Sundays.
What to read on the second Sunday after Easter in Jeruzalemské Church?
And what in the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually found that he was coming to the same ones evangelijním stories.
And so the core canon as developed from the initial Church to conventional wisdom.
So the council simply accepted as gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses in that time.
But as well as deliberately removed more than ten books of the Bible, though to them yet books, which were approved.
Between odmítnutými items we find the writings of the apostles, as well as of the prophets.
Why the word of God to us should refer to the book, which some people are just words and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But as this could be approved, if God was the real author of this random stories, parables and žalmové lyrics?
The Bible was written certainly people, and certainly not too osvíceními, rather the contrary!
This is the reason why so much of its content is historically and scientifically absolutely wrong, whether it is almost anything, from the beginning to the end.
We are talking about people who believed that the snakes and donkeys can speak, believed in ritual magic spells, bloody victims, enchanted objects, magic potions, astrology and five elements of fire.
They thought that if you use magic rod, which someone sprayed with blood, it will cure him of leprosy.
We are talking about people who thought that the rabbits are ruminants and bats are birds and whales are fish and Ms that is a whole number.
These people believed that as a result of a pregnant cow striped patterns, give birth to a calf.
How could this mean someone who knows something about genetics?
The authors of this book didn't know it, of course.
If the Bible was written by a higher being, then it did not contain such errors, which contains.
If it came from the pen really superior beings and was intended as a literal history, then did not contain anything of what it contains.
As a moral guide is totally failing because the majority of the original Hebrew writings were drawn up and the ignorant and bigoted savages who ignored or support cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, family abuse, child abuse, violence against children, abortion, rape, murder, cannibalism, genocide, and the prejudice against race, nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
In order to defend their inhumanity, claiming that God's will take place.
But creationists still ignore all this.
Some of their Web pages concede that if any fact is in conflict with the Bible, the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if Creationists had his beloved books, they would not be a god.
In their world is one and the same.
It is ironic that reject the "work" as "the worship of God in creation instead of the creator."
But see themselves as a man's word for word of God and God alone and even insist that refute their supposedly "holy" books somehow disproves God as such.
Not all of their version of the god but God version.
Kreacionističtí Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that there could be a God and the Bible could also be wrong, because they can't separate from the doctrine of a deity.
So this is the kind of idolatry, where religious worship the man produced compilations, as if these books were the god itself, because he thinks that they are HIS word.
But God never write nediktoval no from the files of any religion.
What the people approved or rejected his "unchangeable words of any god, was allegedly vymýšleno sestavováno, grouped, translated, interpreted, adjusted and often also deliberately pozměňováno and překrucováno only fallible human beings.

The site GitHub appeared for two days before the instrument, which allowed it to obtain a password by brute force, an automatic repeat login attempts to user accounts with different slogans.
This tool is proven to work, but Apple closed after two days of the security hole.
There is, however, that the potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to the various accounts before publication of this instrument.

The smart way to save money for college textbooks
Whereas the price of college textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, the soon-to-be sophomore came with a clever way to cut costs.
Devised a system of lending books from classmates from upperclassmen with a nominal compensation offer to hold back their sale.
"the book to the calculations, which normally costs $180 per semester, I won ten and chicken nuggets," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Books required in his last semester would cost $430, says.
He spent 120.
According to the university council spends an average student for textbooks and supplies more than 1 200 dollars a year, but the students have various options on how to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students become Schroeder's online shops and creative solutions.
Lending books, which allows students to use semester book is on the rise, and often with a significant discount, than if you bought it.
Neebo Inc operating more than 250 bookstore in locations other campuses, says that lending books has doubled from 2011.
The survey says shows that about a quarter of the books have been borrowed in the last spring semester in college bookstores, senior vice president of Neebo Trevor Meyer says.
Less than half of teaching texts, according to the National Association of university shops in university bookstores buys.
Here's 101 best ways to succeed.
Online shopping
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower than in a college bookstore on the Internet.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "calculus" Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetlera is almost $290, but on the Internet, it is possible to Chegg.com, retail specialist on textbooks, buy new 239,99 dollars.
Buying used
If you don't mind other people's remarks or wear appropriate and destruction, the possibility of teaching texts are used.
At Chegg.com, "calculus" sold for $93,49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a student, a senior at Brigham Young University, says that Amazon.com bought a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business 42 cents.
The new sold for $48.
The university lecturer Ingrid Braceyová, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst College Without Walls suggests that students at their teachers to verify whether an older edition are acceptable.
Sometimes the changes are essential for the work in the seminars.
If so, an older edition may sell for a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com. also are a popular alternative for the purchase of used books
Lending
Also worth considering půjčovaní textbooks, if they go well with them, you have to go back and don't need them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
The student would borrow could, for example, for the whole semester calculus" for about $20.
Meet the terms of trade, in which you have a book, including penalty for remarks, accent or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If a book coming back in time, the fine may be higher than the price of a new book.
E-book
Another option is to raise e-knihu instead of the normal books.
Sometimes these books are essentially lending in the form of electronic licences valid for a certain period of time from distributors like Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble and Chegg Inc.
Chegg lends "calculus" about 61 dollars for six months.
According to Braceyové so you can find the best offer students literary courses, because many classics is now available to download for free, while of Natural History and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, walk around the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be at Pepperdine Law School, recommended to drive under ISBN because it guarantees that you're buying the right book.
Before you book order over the Internet, make sure that it is really the warehouse, Gault says.
Convinced of it on their own skin.
The book, which bought, was sold out for four weeks, and had to pay the full price for a book from the university bookstore.
Mud, mud.
And then the torso was found in the well of the rifle from the end of the war
The well is located near the church of St George.
Uncovered stand around and we started out aged silt - roughly four feet of mud and rotting leaves.
When we neared jílovitému bottom, we ran into the barrel of the gun," said Radomil Novak.
We pulled it, cleaned, and found that it is the torso of the German assault rifles, used by the SS.
The decision is unusual.
According to my information, such guns produced by the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," added Smith.
Wooden structural things all the time, so it is useless.
But her body is intact - holds its shape.
As the well itself?
One explanation exists.
Maybe put it, the people who need to get rid of the weapons used by SS troops, probably out of fear that were displaced.
The Nazis on the run, it would be likely to do.
They threw away their weapons in the woods," thinks the finders.
The rifle was the only thing that enthusiasts from Hnutí Duha Jeseníky found in the well.
"there could also be hand grenades, those that had been around a lot, so we slowed to the excavation of mud, we carefully over him was a disaster, but nothing else happened down there," Smith approached.
The decision ends in the depositary of the museum at the Hall in nearby Slezských Rudolticích.
The Ukrainian general: Captured a Czech I yet neosvobozoval
An exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz General-Colonel Bondarenko Volodymyrem Rubanem, which exempts Ukrainian troops from pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Excuse me, I have to take it................................................. Call me from Dobnets perhaps eight times," he said in an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz Ukrainian General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise, also the director of the Center for the liberation of prisoners of war.
The general Volodymyr Ruban in a televised debate.
In any such disruption cannot hear the names of the people, their numbers or the place where they are - or should be - which Ruban explains to his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"That's it - go there," he concluded one of lightning discussions with Doněckem and ours.
Volodymyr Ruban Majdanu is a reserve general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant of the anti-government protests.
Yesterday, when we spoke the conversation was in Donetsk.
Twenty-four hours a day devoted to the liberation of the Ukrainian soldiers from pro-Russian separatists.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that the Czechs fought on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number 30.
There may be even more, of course.
You've met some Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: Relieved I've captured Serbs, Dagestánce, one Swede, the Chechens, Georgians................................................. But Čecha not yet.
But I know whom to contact in Prague, where we encountered on your captive compatriot and were able to rescue him.
A Ukrainian soldier captured separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs, who join proruským separatists and Ukrainian soldiers is captured?
They should understand that if you like the Czechs are fighting in Ukrainian flags of volunteers and separatists is captured, then shoot them after the hearing without mercy, as well as any other foreigners.
Separatists consider these men rent mercenaries and you deserve nothing under them nothing other than death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers captured a group of doněckých separatists - and between them, therefore, a Czech - so it sits behind bars and act with him as a prisoner of war.
In short, the guy would survive.
The Ukrainian side behaves in the war, as well as the state.
A.cz: And how much you managed to save the Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand it, so the exchange.
Some sources indicate that it already exceeded a hundred men.
For a long time we've stopped counting how many people we help.
But we are free but................................................. Before the war saved, if they decide to continue the fighting.
Rescuers are doctors, surgeons in the war, but we are not.
So it is.
And every day growing more and more.
Every day to save someone.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And may not always go on the exchange.
Sometimes just mere human plea for the release of prisoners.
It is rumored that you've gotten for several months by pro-Russian separatists great authority and even the confidence................................................. As well as in the Ukrainian company.
How did you manage to build respect for both sides?
A difficult question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "the mad general with steel balls."
It does not offend me.
And maybe that's the essence of our work as well.
As the head of the Ukrainian officer corps, I already had some authority.
Never nechytračím, cheat and I always say.
Whatever is going on, so honest and tell the truth.
Even if it is the Ukrainian government, or that the Donets or luhanské very unpleasant.
If torture and kill people?
So they simply say, torture and kill them.
And that they are crimes.
Often without risking life, even me in the exchange of prisoners and captured................................................. This job for me any time could mean the end................................................. I don't have to go back.
Do you know how many executions and torture of prisoners?
................................................. [long pause]................................................. To torture prisoners in interrogation resort Ukrainians and separatists.
Unfortunately.
And executions?
Those are just the Donets side.
On that, as well as the Ukrainian army executes prisoners, I don't have the information.
No indication that the Ukrainian army doing something similar.
The number of executions, we have no idea, but the numbers indicate can't and won't.
A.cz: Describe the characters and themes of the pro-Russian separatists.
The officers are among them, but also the veterans of Afghanistan.
Trying on autonomy and democracy in Donetsk or Luhansku - so that, at least, they say.
They don't want to play more games with the Ukrainian oligarchs.
Separatists have had enough of the oligarchs and their implacable opponents - are on life and death.
As we say - the over-eating to them after the throat.
Given the same dreams and aspirations of the people, by the way, showing the Majdanu.
And now some zaspekuluji: Russia supports separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
One speculation is great and the other, on the contrary, the small.
Now that my sentence but holds the irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: How do you, for example, appears to be one of the hardest leaders pro-Russian separatists Igor Bezler?
When the war front line, I am unarmed and show the soldiers or armed men bare hands outstretched.
And I always have both sides of those two or three hundred meters in the shot or optical sights.
You see the faces of the people who go on me, every time................................................. And they can at any time pull the trigger their weapons.
A paratrooper, a colonel with the German and Ukrainian ancestry.
Considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother lives in the Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And, if so, just as a small province in the Russian empire.
In any case, talked about it and Ukraine is regarded as a kind of misunderstanding incurred.
According to him, such a state would not exist.
At the same time it is the sworn enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we are talking about charakterech - in Ukrainian television news show you your Prime Minister Arsenije Jaceňuka labeled weak, helpless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
For three hundred meters walk will always afraid of at least five times.
Why should I hold the view that Jaceňuk is very weak, then the prime minister and that is bad for our country?
According to you, has a share of the war in Ukraine?
You may know that Ukrainians Jaceňuka dubbed "rabbit."
And the rabbit is the fear in the eyes of Ukrainians animal, from which he would or should in any other respect and authority.
His behaviour directly copying the behavior of a rabbit.
Maybe it's a good economist, but as the Prime Minister has no right to cry in the war in Parliament, begging him to play his intrigue with him, threatening that puts function................................................. He must govern the country and manage it in a time of war and protect.
When the threat to the country's prime minister is not entitled to family, friends, the rest of the maudlin emotions.
He was the first of the Ministers of Ukraine.
And Jaceňuk?
He acts as a teenage girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because it was never strong................................................. To fight for Ukraine, but he is constantly complaining at all.
Therefore, it should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why couldn't save the Guardians of the Galaxy sales
Expendable 3 Sylvester Stallonea returned from devadesátimilionového budget of less than $30 million in the US and Sin City: A woman, for which I murdered returned from the million-strong budget just 12 million.

In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue, that may be something to his disastrous prophecy.
With an indication of possible major bikini briefs in summer 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoňů and Jurassic world, other figures in the film industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in sales as simply "cyclical." for the Hollywood Reporter said: "next summer will be the largest bikini briefs in the history of the summer and no one will be worried with the sale."

The film festival is in crisis
After a huge enthusiasm over the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu flared among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next few days suggest the impression that interest in the 71st Venice festival ebbed somewhat.
Whatever the reason, that the number of seats in the largest room increased to fourteen hundred or so that followed Birdmanovi critics acknowledged, but for the spectators less attractive shots as the document on the genocide in Indonesia in the late 1960s, Look silence and other social issue films from the American 99 homes after the Iranian Stories, in cinemas simply remained empty seats.

Fortunately, the present crisis is the lack of personalities, but only in the context of the film.
While younger fans craved autogramech leaders comic superheroes and Andrew Garfield and Michael Shannon, who is in 99 homes quite successfully to dramatic roles, a visit to the legendary actor Al Pacino has become the main event for all generations without distinction.

In the story, the epiphany outside competition, who directed the Oscar-winning Barry Levison under a Philip Roth novel, Pacino role, which is close to him have you: An actor at the peak of fame, who suffer from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But to see him the next day as the owner of a hardware Manglehorn from a rural town in the film, directed by David Gordon Green, it was really an unforgettable experience.
Volpiho trophy for best performance wouldn't miss him - but is still an artist Pacinova format needed price?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and that Italian especially because, although he was born in New York, Al Pacino says proudly to the country from which they came from his grandparents.
Points for Italy
Indeed, the Italian film this year have fared very well in Venice.
Black soul, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film after Birdmanovi odměněným long a standing ovation.
Kalábrijská offshoot of the Mafia is viewed in it to look at family relations between the clans fought each other for power and money, and able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good movie: A good scenario, a camera, music director and actor.
He also made the 10,000th heart chamber psychothriller Saverio Costanzo Albou Rohrwacherovou in the role of women, which almost kills his misguided fussing with her own child.
On the contrary, a warm reception from the French competition films nedočkaly ransom for glory, nor 3 heart, both works, adhering to the traditional model table films, which are based on the popularity of movie.
But, after all, two really excellent film, Birdman and Black soul, not for the first half of the festival so little.
And though the festival films are generally depressing themes, Peter Bogdanoviche's new film "She's Funny That Way, absurdist comedy set in Venice outside competition and filmed in the style of American veseloher 40 years, was able to lift the mood on more than one day.

The New Testament morality is still alive, although few Scots in Scotland today still goes to church.
The Scots have far greater tendency to chase the money changers from the temple, than to let them dictate how to vote.
The Scottish nationalists boss Alex Salmond knows this, and in a television debate, repeatedly questioned his rival unionistického Darling, whether it is willing to respect "the sovereign will of the Scottish people," if the Scottish electorate voted for independence, and start to promote the single currency for both Scotland and England.
That Darling, forced to choose between Scotland and London financiers and civil society, and with a grimace fell into this trap.
Of course, that Darling will not support the mandate of the Scottish electorate.
But the debate about what currency Scotland will have been more or less neutralised.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, jobs and the defence of public health services, which are free citizens.
Darling currency was supported in the case of the London banker and also created the impression that it will protest against the privatisation of health.
Thus, as Salmond said, "got into bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for each Scottish politics.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with the Conservatives.
David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland confirmed it not to voters, but the association "bosses," the Confederation of British Industry.
Is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate the independence of the Scottish Premier Salmondem was a serious mistake for the unionist campaign.
Cameron so looks like a cowardly absentující domestic.
The Scots would respect him if he arrived at a debate in the Scottish premier.
Cameron could at least say that Scotland can be a successful independent country."
Alistair Darling can say anything of the sort, it operates almost physical pain.
What she says, it is clear: The Scots do not spring up and must accept what is.

Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong the day after the decision of the voting provoking the Chinese authorities
A group of people loyal to Beijing, who stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The standing committee of the National People's Congress approved on Sunday, only two of the three candidates to participate in the elections in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first win the support of the nominating committee, which will likely consist of members loyal to Beijing.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the electoral tickets and get pro-demokratické activists to restore the promise and cripple the financial center of Hong Kong protest movement" Okupace Central."
Political reform in Hong Kong is the main reason for the tension, Chinese leaders fear that the requirement for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing in June published a detailed report outlining the Chinese authority in Hong Kong, Democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the election in a separate official district and hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's business district and took it.
The press conference, at which Premier Li will organise the government in Hong Kong and China's liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun should also talk to a few press conferences and the deputy director of the State Board of Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Feng Wei.
Student activists have said that the afternoon gather in front of government offices in Hong Kong.
The last days of the colonial government 150 years ago Britain had never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin urges Kiev with Eastern Ukraine to begin negotiations on "national sovereignty"
According to the description of the events of the Russian newspaper asked Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday that the Ukrainian government to halt the fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on "national sovereignty" of the breakaway regions.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained his remark that Putin did not intend to imply that the area of eastern Ukraine controlled by the separatists will become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reconsidered, a Russian-speaking area to get the power to protect their rights and interests.
Putin's call for Kiev's government to act with pro-Russians rebels as equals, represents a clear strategy, under which governed since the unrest erupted five months before: Help separatists to occupy the territory and make the Ukrainian government grant new civil Novorusku de facto independence, to place the West could join with Russia.
In an interview for the first state television channel Putin condemned the Ukrainian military action to recapture the eastern area Dobnets Luhansku, dominated by separatists in March and April, after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists occupied territory recently identified as "Novorusko" or "New Russia," the term, which refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian empire.
The Russian news agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words, in which a prisoner is an illusion" anyone who believes that the peace negotiations are on the horizon, because the Ukrainian politicians launched 26 October before the parliamentary election campaign, while government forces are attacking the civilian population in areas controlled by separatists.
"in the interest of the people living in these areas must immediately initiate meaningful negotiations and not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the status of national sovereignty to the southeast of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's suggestion on national sovereignty was intended in the context of wider autonomy, which is already with the leadership in Kiev for several months and which is to alleviate the concerns of the Russian-speaking areas from the threat of cultural and language rights
Peskov said that the necessary autonomy the eastern areas can only grant the Ukrainian government.
It is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The spokesman of the Kremlin, which should be corrected "incorrect interpretation" of Putin's remarks, stressed Russia's leadership to resolve an uprising by the separatists in the east, which is different from the open access to the occupation of Crimea, where most of the origin of the two-million-strong population are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had much more trouble to annex Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people are conducted by the Russians and opinion polls before the conflict, showed broad support staying in the Ukraine.
Autonomy, which Russian diplomats acted in international fora, regional governments in the Ukraine would be given the power to determine its own trade agreements and international relations, and, in fact, that would give the Kremlin's de facto control over the territory, which together with the Russian mainland Crimean.
The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago, is the main Russian naval fleet, a maritime business background and historical coastal departments.
The area between Russia's Rostov and Crimean are also Centre mines, factories and foundries, producing important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Porošenko suggested during his inaugural speech of June 7, Ukrainian lawmakers - a new election - to consider changes in the constitution, which would give the diverse regions more control over their finances and linguistic status.
This vision of the autonomy but differ considerably from the Kremlin's vision and separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's last call, Kiev to negotiate with separatists as equals followed another rebel procedure last week, after the Russian troops and tanks entered Ukraine to the east of previously peaceful areas along the Sea.
Separatists boosted by the Russians took control of Novoazovskem with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.
That precipitated a huge civilian and military efforts to Mariupol, a port with metalurgickými combinates about 500 000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovskem and narrow entrance gate on the Crimean peninsula.
Porošenko spoke to a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday and urged the action that would prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, which is independent of the past 23 years.
"We are getting closer to the point of no return," warned Porošenko.
On the territory of Ukraine is now in the thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks.
The EU summit has not taken the final steps - leaders are calling for the adoption of additional sanctions against Russia in the case of the unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Lysenko Andrij, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsku, after last week's two convoys of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops into the Donets region to support the besieged separatists.
The first of 63 Ilovajsku reported in Ukrainian soldiers, who were captured during the Russian invasion, Sunday were traded for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.

Sigma's footballers Lébra udobřili, even without winning
Olomouc - thunder and lightning, the co-owner of the Sigma Olomouc Josef Lébr cast on his subordinates, last week, it seems, are a thing of the past.
Though from Opava came at the end of the day just a point behind bezbrankovou draw.
The intensity and ferocity of his club boss just udobřili.
The money to pay the club could come soon.

Militancy and commitment that we played in the second half, it was exactly what I want to see the players.
In this case, I am able to forgive, that he wins.
We played from the beginning of the season, so I believe that we have not beaten yet," he thinks Lébr.
Sigma in Opava weathered the initial domestic pressure, and then settled the game in the second half was better.
After the victory of Kalvodovi charges they picked up, but his options to score, and so they could not win.
The result was not to our liking.
To the complete satisfaction of us missed only one transformed a chance," said Lébr, but didn't think that a change in approach footballers caused only by his threat.

It was like the first fifteen minutes today.
It took, before we set with firmness and realize what the other league is about.

It is to be hoped that in the coming matches, it's Sigma will work from the start.
"I would love to believe that," he added.
