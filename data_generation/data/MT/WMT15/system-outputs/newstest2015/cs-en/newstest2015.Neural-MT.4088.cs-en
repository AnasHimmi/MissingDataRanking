Petr Čech: vessel na last moment?
Anything is possible
Today is the last day that can be seen through the window and make a large transfer.
The next chance will come in the winter.
Petr Čech, currently replacing Chelsea, but now does not fit for a new professional treaty in Madrid, Monaco, or Paris.
It sits at the NH NH Hotel, speaks with Czech journalists and is about to play with the Czech entertainment on the gaming game with the Americans, and subsequently on the sharp start of the Euro 2016 on the Netherlands.
V gate Chelsea receives v nové season Premier League over Thibaut Courtois, Čech se první za ten let v London klubu got do pozice alternate.
From time to time, it would be remembered that it would be possible for Real Madrid to be interested in the Czech Republic.
In the beginning of the season, he had lost the Spanish Super in duels with Atlétikem and made no entrance to the league season when he lost 2: 4 in San Sebastian.
It was also about the interest of Paris SG.
The French League season odstatoval two cumulative and two remízami, on Sunday apart St. Etienne 5: 0.
relatively most pushing shoe klub AS Monaco.
He has the balance of 1-1-2 in the League, and the weekend broke up with Lille amicably 1: 1.
Na tabloids English sites dnes up report, že by Čecha Park could v Queens Park Rangers.
According to the English bookies, however, the departure from Chelsea to the last minute is not likely to be very likely.
Skybet gave him a course 4: 1.
Peter, is it possible to change the uniform over the next few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never a hundred percent in football.
Perhaps during the day, there will be an offer that will not refuse.
What would it have to look like?
 (laughing) "Well, I don't know how such an offer that can't be refused.
It would have to be consistent with all the parties, in particular, would depend on the position of Chelsea, if any offer of the club would be dealt with or not.
Is it technically feasible to do such a transfer when you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract in the new Grizedale?
So I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation, there are a lot of players today, all of them are on the representation, and there will be a lot of transfers today.
So, somehow, it would be workable.
How many clubs on the planet that could afford you?
I really don't know.
So you go to the departure of the netlačíte?
The situation where I am in the first three matches of the new season season is new to me after 15 years of career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
I want this fight for the position of Chelsea Chelsea to continue to participate, and it is on the coach who will decide what decisions will do in the course of the next few weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision?
I take all the factors into account.
There is, of course, a sporting aspect to me, but I am looking at this from the personal side of the family, of course.
Is it possible you could catch another club in England?
That's the question I thought I'd never care about.
But in football, everything is possible.
I don't want to exclude anything.
I don't know the answer.

Restoring a very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Kongresmeni Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed the law to protect the unions as civil law.
"As the trade unions work, jobs are working for the middle class," says Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, who is a Co-Chair committee.
That is why I am so proud that I can, together with the model of casual rights by John Lewis, introduce the law empowering the position of employees.
This anti-discrimination legislation will give workers the same legal opportunities to prevent discrimination in the trade unions, as in other forms of discrimination - and stop protiodborové forces.
Edit the Law on Labour Relations to allow all employees who face discrimination if they want to involve themselves in the trade unions, judging by the civil courts - and compensation for damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other promoters in the law are tabling, is once again at the American ideal.
Despite the trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states - the Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, broaden and respect labour law.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember when the country championed democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to collect.
When the United States took Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisors supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that military autocracy Hideki Toja will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions play a role in shaping the new Japan, included their language, and openly acknowledged that "the right of staff to collect, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed. "
When the United States, after World War II, ranked Germany, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers to the Germans to create a constitution that will ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler will be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans were aware that employees would need to be organized and promoted in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly says: "The right to create societies that will safeguard and improve labour and economic conditions for every individual and every occupation or profession.
The arrangements that will restrict this right or strive for its damage will be abolished. The measures leading to the fulfilment of such a purpose are unlawful.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission for Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the complainants and Roosevelt guarantees that "everyone has the right to create unions and enter them in the protection of their interests. "
For generations, the Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When the country has counseled other countries how to create civil and democratic society, the Americans have explained that the right to create labour unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with firms and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights in America are being attacked, it is certainly necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organise and promote society in free and open society.
Fifty years ago, Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the trade unions have given the power of the nation, but it has extended it.
If the standard of living standards of millions of people, they created the market for industry and production raised to the unsuspected level.
Those who attack the unions are forgetting these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and we should not.
Formal recognition of human rights as human - and the extension of the protection of civil rights, in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis restored the ideals that raised America and made the real promise of democracy.
The Judge temporarily blocked the law that could close all the abortion clinics in Louisiana
The Federal Judge on Sunday temporarily blocked an unwritten law, which, according to attorneys, would probably shut down all five clinics of abortion in the state.
Regulation Regulation signature governor governor governor governor v červnu, které má v červnu enter 1. září, by po doctors implementing implementing implementing, aby after implementing, aby mají right right patient v hospital distant do 30 mil od enforcement jejich practice.
The resolution of the judge means that doctors can proceed temporarily in the execution of legal abortions, and in the meantime they must procure this authorisation.
"The requesting party will be legally able to carry out his activities and, in the meantime, obtains a permit," says the federal judge of John deGravellese.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month for the judge to issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Activists for the right to abortion, which is the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said that doctors will provide more time to obtain a permit.
"Today's decision provides for women in Louisiana that they will be safe from the saner law that is supposed to deprive them of health and their rights," Nancy Northupová, the President and the executive director of the Center for reproductive rights, which, on behalf of three of the five clinics, was responsible for blocking the law.
It was not clear whether the decision was taken by doctors from two clinics, which were not between the the, and also requesting the granting of this authorisation.
Louisiana is among eleven states that have approved similar laws, with the courts in Alabama and Mississippi such measures declared unconstitutional.
The key part of the Texas Law, which would shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state, blocked the federal judge on Friday.
The activists for women's rights to abortion, together with the Association of American obstetricians and Gynecology and the American Medical Association, claim that the need to have this authorisation is subject to medical requirements that are not necessary.
Opponents of abortion have argued that the measures are intended to protect women's health, and some have also welcomed the fact that the clinics would be closed over the measures.
Centrum pro reproductive rights that, že v Louisiana má has pouze one doctor the abortion.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop carrying out abortions, this doctor would, in fear of their safety, have ceased to do so, said the group.
In response, the authorities have indicated that they would advise doctors who carry out abortions while awaiting the execution of a request for the granting of rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills more often
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video with his late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In women in the Australian countryside, there is a higher risk that they will die of ovarian cancer than with their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1100 Australanek diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer, and found that only 35% of five years after the diagnosis.
The Head of Research of Susan Jordan of QIMR Medical Research Institute stated that women in rural and outlying areas of the country were about twenty percent higher probability that they would die during the study than in women in urban areas.
LOWER STUDIES: New medicines may slow down lung cancer and ovaries
Researchers women watched during the seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chances of survival had influenced the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in the elderly, in which cancer was diagnosed at the advanced stage.
In women in rural and outlying areas, there were about twenty percent higher probability that they would die during the study than in women in urban areas.
Although studies have not been designed to determine why women living outside the city are more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"Sickness can best cure gynekoonkologové, who usually reside in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of medical services at a distance to overcome the barrier at the distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transport services that will enable women to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are healing far from their families and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of the geographical location, which underlines the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.
Výzkum financed Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer dnes shall Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, in its 33 years, young mother, Elisha Neaveová from the City of Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret a reduction in the number of owners' owners
According to the study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary decline of owners of home under 35 years could lead to the fact that today's young generation of consumers will reach the "main age group, " the garden centres will come up to ten million pounds a year.
According to the report, the people who rent the housing will spend on average 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own.
As other factors threatening the sector, which earns an estimate of five billion pounds a year, the increase in the number of people living in very wooded areas, where they are not gardens, are favored by the cobblestones of the place used as a parking area and the shrinking size of the gardens.
In the area of Great London, where the share of owned homes fell from 61% to 43% during the six years, they look at one household of the lowest cost of gardening products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal soil Society stated that housing in residential or lack of space does not mean that people could not cultivate plants.
Guy Barter, the chief gardener consultant for RHS, said, "The tenants are very popular with plants in pots - when they move, they can take the plants with them."
The Report report revealed that the "golden age " of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of home owners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980's.
This year, too, has predicted higher sales due to better weather, which came after unfavourable conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin, at the meeting of his youth organization, which reminds me most of all, rattled nuclear weapons, and, in essence, he has shown that their views are stolen, gave us a lecture on democracy today.
However, I have the feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of the Haitian state.
Great nations have one common, and that is that it is able to control both Hindu nationalism and that the inferiority complex can transform into imperialist appetites.
The time goes to the east, apparently, except in the west.
Whereas the Western world had thought that the time of war on dominion over Europe was long ago, on the east, he thought that the ignored had been for a long time, and it was necessary to regain its international position.
Such moods and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazi power of the Nazis, and then followed by an explosion of nationalism unlike today's situation in Russia.
And then the very same cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the destruction of inconvenient political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, that is quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly the large part of the Russians, must be homesick when Russia ruled half the world, and the other part trembled before them.
Perhaps the Western politicians had done it alone, perhaps little of Vladimir on's shoulders, perhaps not inviting him where he wanted, and perhaps they had to underestimate him, and he simply acted as a typical Russian mujik.
He had done order at home, his face that he didn't really want to go anywhere and sharpen his knives.
Now he decided to get back to the lost position.
It starts slowly, it has time.

After all, our veterans now vzpomnají, as they had in the Czechoslovakia.
Well, the Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, this is so měký, can be peel like onions, and I dream the whole of the EU.
That would make it so much for the great Russia to leap up.
It must be remembered where their place is.
And as detonators, we will use our people who live in their territory.
The Russians are all over the place, and if they say they're there, they just don't get there, and we won't let them, we'll protect them.
And the Russian will rule, for whatever else it is born.

There's more light on this day, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad had always gotten into the tub and just lay there, and then he could hear how slowly he began to sing for himself.
When I went around, I realized that he had been doing this for years to feed his family, and I began to respect him more.
Even so, Henry had had a childhood without parental love.
Dad said, "I didn't say" I love you. "

His daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love that had missed him as a child.
Can you stop that "I love you"?
Don't embarrass me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!

His television career began in the middle of the 1970's, "I have long been the only Negro mimic / comedian on TV."
He was learning the march.
Apart from the fact that I had to see the public, I had to learn how to invent a working joke, to be a star and to be on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny v New Faces in 1975
In view of the fact that his manager had the right to the stage production of The Black and White minstrel Show, the amusement program in which the actors were trained for blacks, Henry had been in it for five years.
My family was uneasy about it.
I wish I could never have done it, but I don't regret it.
Although it was strange and awkward, I was working on the big scenes and learning how to work with the crowd.
What had been "years and years of the British television, " was also a" grotesque parody of blacks. "
In the 1980's, Henry had worked in alternate comedy circles, and presented figures that were also ridiculing and they British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began to broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990's, he was also known as Chef Gareth Blacklock in comedy seriále Chef.
For the next decade, the commercials, documentaries, TV serials, and the films in the movies, but after his airing on the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what you're going to do now, Len, it looks like you're stuck in one place, or a little out of the way."
The next one was a documentary on Radio 4 called What 's So Great About...? / What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really teach him at school, and I thought it was something for a white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Dench Dench, said, "You should try."
If you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words, and you'll see why all of us are so fond of Shakespeare.
Henry, for the document, delivered twenty lines from Othellovy's final speech, and he was in it.
It seemed to me that I could do it.
As if it gave me courage.
"That's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn the text, and find out about it.
So testing was hard, and I had read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be in trouble, which did not happen.
Soon he began to play in full of mistakes.
I was at the National Theatre. I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical flaw, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to assume responsibility for seizing the audience.
"Syllables in my head said," Before you fix your computer, you have to talk about ten minutes. "
Instead, the theatrical director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I left the stage and said something to me, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve this for me.
"You play, you stay in the role."
Henry v Plotech v Duchess Theatre
Learn the text Plotů was a challenge.
The panic is quite good, it adds.
The game was also well accepted, so it's like God's sign that says: "This should be done."
That's what they call it, of course.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I'm glad to be in the service.
Still, Henry's brain remains geek the whole time of our conversation interrupts the interrupts performances, when he comes in and out of the role of the imitator.
I decided to do nothing, because to have satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I'd say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into a cul-de-sac.
Sometimes, when I want to, I'm Live at the Apollo, but I'm not happy about it.
I asked if he was ever going to organize a tour tour.
Joy z toho sit v one room s director, který helps helps shapes shapes, resource a end way - think, že bych se I to.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
Acting amuses me.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.

Most schools in Ukraine, on Monday (1 September), opened again after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, the Prime Minister Yatsenyuk Yatsenyuk led his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the reporters that not all the schools had opened again, but that he was determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not on all schools, there was a traditional ceremony for 1.září.

We hope that there will be peace at last, and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful in the future.

V Roně Fairheadové BBC BBC found boss pro hard časy
They bear the clouds of glory from the world of banking, media management, and the internal Conclave of the Conservative Party.
She had the experience of the front lines.
career began in the nezávislou company Bain and Co, then went over Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world of -Nicholas.
Seven years was an executive director of the Financial Times. He resigned as the highest function in the parent company Pearson's occupied by her younger colleague.
It's said that her severance was approaching a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
David Browne was recommended by Lord Brown, former director of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed a private expertise: she became an advisor to the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former member of the City Council.
In May I described the work of the director as a cup of poison.
Not only is the BBC's extensive and intricate entity in the centre of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation is turning two directions: into the top layer of the BBC's hierarchy, but also out of the voice of the public in times of unease when things do not work.
Jedná se o almost monopoly monopoly, který si calls thorough reform.
But the director would risk coming into the company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, spread it out, and then prepare for work.
It's a difficult challenge.
If it weren't so hard, many people would like to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and how it revises its status.
S tím, jak se extends heading heading a nová technologie question old security, má s him immediate negotiations o licence fees pro BBC large danger.
For a modest amount of sterling pounds a year, the British public buys a share of something that is certainly the biggest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that its production reaches 96% of households, and it costs only 40 pence a day.
Moreover, the BBC's popularity is clearly rising: 53% of supporters, compared to 31% ten years ago.
Models of the use of the BBC services have changed: Today, newspaper headlines appear on a mobile phone and I can look at iPlayeru on the programs that I have missed.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
He needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry asserts that the offending tweet does not approve
Tweet from the official twitterového account of the Texas Governor Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained an offensive image of a democratic state deputy who initiated the criminal charges of Perry from misuse of power.
Tweet was erased later, and on Perry's account it was published by another one who had distanced himself from the previous one.
From my account he left the tweet who was not a authorized.
"I disagree with the ill-judged and withdrew it," he said at the next post.
Perry's assistants did not answer the questions immediately.
Even though the tweety were sent from Perry's official account, it was not clear who was responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published the unflattering, humorous image of the State attorney Travis County Rosemary Lehmbergové, who, in April 2013, was condemned to drive in drunkenness.
When she refused to resign, Perry rejected the disbursement of the funds for her office, which Perry, the possible candidate for the President in 2016, brought this month to a large jury in Austin.
On the label at tweetu said, "I am not always driving with three times higher levels of alcohol in the blood than the permitted limit... but when it is, the governor Perry is calling for responsibility."
I'm drunkest a in Texas.
Investigation against Perry did not lead to the office of Lehmbergové.
Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was designated by the Republican judge.
Perry was found guilty, and the charge was a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has asked the judge in case to reject the accusation because the use of the law for the prosecution of the longest serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry interrupted the payment of $7.5 million from the state fund for the separation of public interest in Travis County and prosecuting corruption in Texas, after refusing to resign.
The rejection caused a formal complaint by the left-leaning group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes famous.
After all, in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, he ended up on the fifth point in the Committee's committee, he told Perry that he might end up with his own picture, as he runs near the lake, and in words: "Here I am, Southern Charlotte!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market returns "to normal"
One prominent of London developer had warned that the housing market in southeastern England had "returned " to a normal level of activity.
Housing in the capital was the subject of high demand and price volatility, and the widespread fear of the credit bubble had prompted the Bank of England to impose a limit on mortgages.
Tony Pidgley, founder and president of the developer company for demanding clients of Berkeley, said, "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market from the top point in 2013 has returned to a normal level of transactions." adds that it provides a "stable environment for operation. "
The housing market in the housing market has prospered well because of the main city flooding the merchants from abroad.
According to the land registry office only last year, the price of the city had risen by 18,5%, thus far from 6,7% in England and throughout Wales.
The average selling price of the private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley had risen by about one-fifth, and at the end of April rose to 423 000 pounds.
However, due to the strengthening of the pound, it is not so attractive in recent months for the foreign merchant's foreign buyers - some of them also put up the introduction of new taxes on real estate and talk about "capital tax ," with which politicians have come before the parliamentary elections of next May.
The London Real Estate Office warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for loans, will slow the growth of the market in the sale of both real estate and prices during the second half of the year.
The new data of the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the amount of approved mortgages in the month of July, indicating that the housing market has calmed down.
Hamptons International, another real-estate office, decreased on the basis that home prices have already begun to fall, its forecast of the rise in the price of London's real estate for the year 2015 to 3%.
The volume of transactions, according to the realtor, in London's most expensive neighborhoods as Chelsea, Mayfair, and Kensington, each year reduced by a quarter.
Nevertheless, the demand for housing in the main city for Berkeley was a blessing, because it has increased cash for more than 2,2 billion.
Pidgley added, "The demand for the right, well housing in a good location remains the same, and thanks to the sale of the sale."
In June, the company announced that, from the beginning of April, 3 742 real estate was sold, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual profit before tax increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, yields by 18% to 1,6 billion.
V pondělí před annual meetings společnosti Pidgley said, že se foresees, že annual income Berkeley budou v accordance se current market market.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be 450 million.
Shares at the London Stock Exchange had stopped at 23,96 pounds.

Emergency ukázka z lauded nového novel Howard Jacobsona o lásce a point "J"
Dissolved, this is the best way to describe it, gradually spread out like a cardboard box that someone had left in the rain.
From time to time, a woman told him that he was too serious, complex, violent, insulated, and perhaps a little short-tempered.
And then she shook his hand.
He admitted it to himself.
He could fuck, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this talent was the beginning of a love affair which, more than usual, promised to relieve him from his lonely life boredom, and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn beauty was a fragile beauty with a wild mane of hair and a volatile heart from the village on the north island, which was still more and hostile than Port Reuben.
To the south came the older companion, who had assumed that she was her aunt, who inherited the possessions in the damp, but the magnificent valley called, conveniently, the vale of the valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
Trumpets pipes, in the tanks, were the dead spiders, the slugs had signed on the windows, as if they thought it belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled a huge cones.
Dům looked jako cottage z paediatric stories, frightening a same charming, se full full full.
Profil author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for Man Booker Prize.
Closer selection will be announced next week.
The Kevern and the Ailinn were sitting on folding chairs in the long grass and holding their hands, enjoying a sudden warm spring afternoon, absently tuned the public station, which supplied comforting music and with messages, when the sight of her tanned crossed legs reminded him of the old song of a long forgotten black comedian that curtained shades liked to listen to his father.
You're too big.
Because of their natural songs, they had not played such songs in radio.
They weren't forbidden - they were really forbidden - they simply weren't.
They helped them get to the desuetuda, as well as the word desuetudo.
Popular tastes have done what they would never have been able to do, and in the same way as the people with regard to books, they choose memoirs, in which poor people will become rich, cooks, and love novels, so in music they choose ballads.
The Kavern had dropped off the day, and began playing an imaginary piano and a coarse, comic voice singing the serenade Aillininým.
She did not understand.
"That was a favorite song from the jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
He always did his father when he wanted to suppress the letter before he came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when it was still small.
His father told him that he was playing the game with his father.
When you put two fingers in front of the words, it was worth a penny.
It wasn't very funny then, and it wasn't even now.
He only knew that he was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what it was jazz.
She had never heard one before.
Not even jazz, although it wasn't directly built outside the law, wasn't it.
Improvise came out of fashion.
In life, there was a place only for one "if. "
When the melody began to play, people wanted to know exactly where they would end.
The same with humor.
His nepředvidatelnost was on the nerves.
And jazz was the humor in the song.
Although he hadn't heard of Sammy Davis Junior in ten years, he knew Kevern jazz from his father's favorite collection of the old CD.
At least he didn't have to say that the Fats Waller was black.
In view of her age, she could not remember the time when the singers were not Negroes.
No laws or coercion, either.
Povolná society is such that every part of it with gratitude - with gratitude to those who have been happy by chance - agrees with the principle of a group of gratitude.
The people of afro-karibského, the temperament, and the constitution were thrown for antics and athletics, and they sang and ran.
The people from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature for electronics, have taken responsibility for not having a family without a functioning telephone.
The Poles, who remained, were plumbers, the Greeks who stayed, washed dishes.
Those of the Persian Gulf and Levant, whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country, while it was happening to the HAPPENED, KDYBY IF that they were accused of being thrown into the fire, they were afraid that the fire was going to spend the next time.
Every one of his talents.
As she listened to the ballads, she was hard to understand how she could make music out of the vulgar words that had just sung to her.
Music was the expression of love.
"Actually, they're not vulgar," said Kevern.
Maybe only for people who have too big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he liked that song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
A word could not be escaped from behind a sheet of leaves.
She still didn't understand.
Why would your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his lips in her presence.
She thought it was strange.
"It seemed funny," he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief, and shaded the view.
In the whole world, there was nothing but a jumble of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you think so," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She looked upset.
Am I too big?
He looked again.
His feet were not entirely.
Maybe some ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because I have too thick ankles?
I hate that?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have told her "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat knuckles are attracted to me," he said.
I'm a little sick.
It didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got it into trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Perhaps his father was cruel deliberately.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel.
In spite of his eyes.
Ailinn Solomonsová blushed and rose from the couch, knocked off the radio, and spilled out the wine.
Elderberry wine, so the drink couldn't have done it.
She looked as though she was shaking in her agitation like a leaf in a storm.
"I'm flattered that you're stupid," she said...
Except that I don't blame me.
He felt sorry for her words, because of the fear that she had in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did she think she was going to hit her?
She had not spoken to him about his life on the cold north peninsula, where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was the same as here.
It was the same vast and icy ocean.
The same confusion, then, WHAT HAPPENED, even more and more than their ancestors, smugglers and blockers, pissed off from the pub to the inn, ready to put a hand on any woman who would refuse to refuse or laugh at them.
Asshole?
If she won't be careful, she'll get her fists!
At first, the hug had become the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and woman: an antidote to had ballads about love that the radio spat first first, then one hit.
In Kevernova's view, too, because the caresses was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomonsová told him to leave.
He got up from the couch like an old man.
She felt cranky, but the weight of his sorrow surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know.
She watched him go - as if watching him from the window on the floor - the man she had driven.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
Her heart was constricted because of him, for all men, regardless of the fact that a few of them had taken her out.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders slumped, shamed, defeated, all militancy had left him - why did she find this look familiar, though she could not recall a single moment when she had seen it before?
Ailinn Solomonsová, she looked at her feet again.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaumová, intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old working working in the Ofnow, nestatutárním monitoring system of public sentiment, prepared a brief article on the persistence of light and moderate violent acts in the countries of the country where its mitigation or direct stop was most expected if there was enough money and energy to be spent.
"There has been much and much to do," she wrote, "to reassure the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in many battles, and most of them have won, especially in the of, difficult places of land, where, despite the tips of the church towers, the breath of human benevolence was seldom cropped."
But some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
The over nad sentimental baladami, up unfortunate stories a application, že firmly believe v value a rodina life, ale nejen, že v rurálních areas se old areas holding as jako v urban agglomerations, ale evidence také show, že home, na workplace, silnicích a ještě na sportovních playgrounds se appears nová a attack intolerance.
"I'm afraid you have a tendency for too much style," said the supervisor.
I would suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaumová bowed her head.
I have to ask: Are you atheist?
'I think I don't have to answer that,' said Esme.
Are you a dyke?
Esme had objected to her right to privacy and silence.
Feministka?
Another silence.
"I don't ask," he said at last, "that I would have something against atheists, lesbians, or male.
We don't have any preconceptions in this place.
We serve unbiased society.
But a certain type of hypersensitivity, which is perfectly acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort the judgment as you did it.
Obviously, you yourself are opposed to the church - the things you call "cruel " and" brutal " others could interpret as expressions of natural power and energy.
He was still dealing with WHAT HAPPENED, KDYBY IF, as if it had happened, if it had happened yesterday, preparing a country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaumová looked around.
In his head, on the light of the pink, he was blinking the recommendations that had been sent to the world by the last quarter-century or more.
Smile se na neighbor, care o své partner, listen ballads, walk na musicals, use své phone, socialize, explain, you se, apologies se.
Talking is better than silence, the sung word is better than written, but there's nothing better than love.
'I fully understand your reservations,' said Esme softly, when she was sure that her supervisor had finished, 'and I did not say that this morning was not going to be so bad.
My concern, above all, is that, if we are not aware of this in advance, we will repeat the same error that has led to what has led to the WHAT.
But this time the anger and distrust will not be unleashed on others.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips together.
That meant infinite patience.
"Far too far," he said, "if the steps that may have done and perhaps not have done your grandparents, you describe as mistakes.
Too far, you know that you're talking about betraying your "anger " and" distrust " of the others. "
I should not remind anyone in your place that we are not talking about "us and " in the protection of the present. "
There was no "we" and there were no "them."
All we know is that it was a chaotic day.
'In which, if we are honest with each other,' said Esme, 'we are not without guilt.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was fair or not what happened, it happened.
That was before.
That is not what we add - we agree on this.
And as there is no guilt to seduce anyone, there are no things to remedy, even if the remedy was appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past, than to learn from it --
The past exists to forget about it.
If I can add something to this --
Luther Rabinowitz discorporated the tips of his fingers.
"I'll take your report," he said, dismissing it.
On the day, when she went as usual to work, he knocked her down, knocking her down on the sidewalk in a way that was described as "brutal and furious."
Accidents are going to happen.
The United Kingdom's army claims that no putsch is planned - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Kingdom of Angarak have denied that they would organise a coup in order to overthrow the government, and argue that they have acted against the police suspected of attempting to control political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and says that the army surrounded its official headquarters and occupied the government buildings in the capital city of Maseru.
After he had said that he was threatened with death, the Prime Minister had left his family in neighboring South Africa.
The Speaker of the Army of Major Ntlele Ntoi said that, in fact, it was not a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics " that the police tried to arm.
"This morning, the defense forces of the Kingdom of the Kingdom had acted after several reports of information services that there were several groups that were planning to equip some of the radical, political fanatics who were preparing to make havoc on the ground," said the Voice of America.
The spokesman of the South African Government of Clayson Monyela said that military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Though no one said that he seized the government's power by force, it seems to bear the actions of the lesothských defensive elements of the coup d'etat," he said.
Military officials had said that the soldiers had returned to their barracks on Sunday, and was quiet in the capital.
During the absence of absence, the Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said that, in his view, he was attacked because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
From June, when the Dalai Lama has suspended the session of parliament because of the internal disputes, there is a tension in tension.
He said that, despite the contrary, he did not accept his actions by the government.
Production in the euro area is a marginal minimum
The growth of the production, according to the closely observed survey in August in the euro area, has slowed to a minimum.
The final index of purchase managers in the euro area (PMI) from June June dropped in August to 50,7.
Number higher than 50 indicates the expansion.
New orders and factories have damaged the growing tensions between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The figures come from the Thursday meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the eurozone's oddalovaným eurozone and the threat of deflation with inflation at 0,3%.
There have been speculation that the ECB director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that it is considering the quantitative easing of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the US have joined in the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than any growth, the braking effect that has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty in the manufacturer is increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, the chief economist Markit.
Germany Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell to the eleven-month minimum.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell.
Concern about France, Italy has passed from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands have disappeared, too, too reassuring, "said Dobson.
The deceleration of the industry is likely to spill oil into the fire of the analysts analysts implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing that can be said about the production of shopping managers in August is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: Manufacturers in the eurozone have a very complex life at present, because increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds even more uncertainty in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty of trade has proven to be hit - especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially the costly ones.
He said that, as "even more likely, " the ECB would eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative easing," although we expect it to be limited. "
Ten years of the survivors from Beslan: Ten years from the horrors of the occupied school children are still suffering
Ten years ago, the most violent radicals in the school in Beslan in southern Russia, as hostages, were detained by thousands of people.

We went back to Beslan to seek some of the victims who had escaped death during the atrocities in school.
Ten years after the horrific occupation of school in Beslan, in which 334 people died, including 186 children, the surviving heroes had warned last night before the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, was captured and murdered by fanatical terrorists and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy brought the east and the West, which led to the negotiations and the future in this disastrous disaster.
After ten years, we have returned to Beslan in southern Russia in order to seek some of the victims who have escaped death during the atrocities in the school.
We found amazing young people who resisted the misfortune, although the memory of hell caused by terrorists will continue to live on.
What is their greatest wish?
For the war that now destroys Ukraine - and in which children as they have died - it is over.
Girl trying to crawl back into the ruined school gym
It was captured by the leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakovem, as only in the underwear he was trying to crawl back into the rozbombardované school gym after the bomb exploded in it.
Confused Aida was looking desperately for his mother, who was now forty.
They feared that both were dead, but they had survived.
"A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
I had my feet from the blood.
I got up and went back to find my mommy.
He was rescued by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she was fully recovered, but she said, "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'll have to have another surgery.
There were bits of shrapnel in my knee.
Its aim is to become dentist so that it can help people as well as doctors helped.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly does not destroy him," she said determinedly.
"It just happened to me, and that can't be changed.
Once a year, I go to the gym to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we are trying not to talk to our friends.
The pain is too big.
My best friend, and the future classmate of class Gapoevu, was killed there.
As a little, we played together, and we thought we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she did not forget the capture, but the memories of each year fade a little.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we got from Britain and other countries.
When I look at the internet on my picture, as I go through the school window, I say that a lot of people will see it for the first time, they will understand the catastrophe and prevent it from repeating itself.
The boy who had escaped through the rain and believed that his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia's children began in seven years) and survived the three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother.
At that time, he said, "Mum told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down and hold her hand."
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said, "Run."
He was afraid that she was dead, running, and on the way he saw a crying toddler, grabbed the child by the hand and running through a shower of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who had caught him out, said, "Damir told me his mother was dead."
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara had gone to freedom, and lay in the hospital with her injured foot, and she thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said, "I was crying with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the deaths of the News of the World), where Tony Blair's prime minister, and his wife, was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"The nightmare returns every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about that," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are fading.
I remember that at once I threw all my guns into play.
But today I can play computer games in which they are shooting, and I don't have a problem.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think so.
I remember the children I was playing in the backyard, and they didn't get out.
We never say they killed them or died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
On a trip to London, I remember well, especially the way I was able to choose anything I wanted, and as I went on.
But now he fears about places like Ukraine, where he suffers from the war and his friends.
The nightmare returns every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I'm terribly sorry for everyone who has to go through this horror," says Damir, who was in the convent last week.
I want to help very much.
I want to work at the police once, and I hope they'll take me at the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says, "Killed 37 kids from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence after the attack. There were no children shouting and running, and the silence lasted for several months.
He si He na way s Damirem do Londýna.
When I told our story in London, people wept.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to the Cherie Blair and her foundation at the price of the price, and for the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could make a phone call and say that even if it was ten years, I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how to help me and help me.
I remember how he had an appetite for borscht, and so calling all of the Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with the waiters in the restaurant, shooting at them from the water pistol, and they ran and played with him.
And that was only a month from the horror.
I was surprised how the Brits wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said, "I still think that the world has not changed for the better.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think that a lot of children will be killed.
They're the same children as ours.
I think there's something about a lot of people in the news that they listen to when they're bored, or while they do something else.
I know what the people are doing to you.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up, and he was a sweet and quiet boy, not aggressive or angry.
For example, he has no desire for revenge; this does not interest him at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember that, but he's got a lot closer to six classmates, and time goes to the gym and get some candles out there.
When he was smaller, he had trouble, I remember, as he sometimes lay down on the couch with his face turned away from us, and sometimes he was lying in an hour.
He was not asleep, his eyes open.
I remember, too, that he threw all his pistols or other weapons on playing. This is 17, it's taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was certain for a few hours that he was dead, and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and rose to my feet, I looked around and saw hell, all the pieces of human bodies.
I was absolutely sure my little boy had no chance to survive.
"I remember when I cried" Damire, run, run! "but I was convinced that he hadn't heard me.
But he heard her and fled.
So our lives are different from others.
Grigory Grigory, 17
The boy who had taken the photograph after the attack had become the symbol of the horrors in Beslan
The: survivors of Beslan Ilyin Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, to the right Grigory today
When he ran for his life after the Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, he was frightened by his bloody face.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocities in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, gave him his first day at school, and hastened to take his older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists hit the yard, so my boy stayed there for three days," she said.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but everyone died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it's still harder to think about it and talk.
We don't even have a single day to make a fuss about the tragedy.
It doesn't seem to us that this has happened a long time ago, I feel that it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back.
I promise that no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: the photograph of the Gregor (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was carved as a statue (right) 
I remember the day Grigory was looking forward to school, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
That she was alive, I learned when I saw him on TV.
There is even a statue of weeping Gregor in San Marino.
Grigory doesn't like to look at that picture, and we've got it hidden in library.
I understand that, but I think that, because of the picture, people in the world know what pain we feel.
Today, Gregoriy says, "It is important that this does not happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
Such tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find the truth.
Now they are investigating the crash of Boeing in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what the cause was?
There's something wrong with this world.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, no one wants the war, as is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
In order to forget, he needs dozens of years.
It had the effect on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years I had nightmares about the attack, but then it was better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates that they killed.
Therefore, when it comes on 1 September, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is past.
I won't forget it, but I'm sorry.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and started studying medical school at the University of Vladikavkazu.
I want to be surgeon.
First, I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, though they held him at the foot of the killer terrorists
A miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the foot of the killer terrorists during the attack, yet he could survive
When the attack was in full, he was trapped in the gym, sitting next to the bomb at the foot of the killer terrorists.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems as if it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to be an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injuries he had suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I threw at my head.
Now I am older, and it is said that children can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say that this is not true.
"I went to psychologist in 2006, and I felt a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd forgotten.
In 2005 - a year later - that was the first time, and the last time I had entered the gymnasium.
I fainted.
I'll never go back there again, and don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting on it.
Survivors: Gregory Farniev dnes, na laptop se fotografií fotografií taken v hospital po attack
The pain is huge and I carry it every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or I'm talking and never go to school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I've got to be careful about my knee I've hurt, but I'm going to be normal.
But even so I couldn't go on and study at the academy in St Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent them my papers, including medical reports, and told me that it was impossible.
My other hobby are animals, so I joined the veterinary.
I've been there for a second year.
They learn how to treat all animals from 'cats to cows'.
He said, "I know I won't tell my kids about it.
It's not something that children should know about, and no longer what they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "The pain will always be here.
It's inside and it's deteriorating with the coming anniversary.
There was no ceremony.
I know Grigory isn't going to work.
It must be stronger for him, because there was a difference from me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he has returned it to me. Here in Beslan there are traces everywhere.
It's staying with us.
Gregory je dnes adult, ale tu terror the the.
It's hard to accept if something is so terribly unfair.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
There are several operations, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I would say that from 50% has already surpassed the horror, but to overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors have been killed, and the pain is worse.
I've lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift God can give me, but it hurts the loss of the slain.
I know the families in which the other children were born, but also the widows, which had been reborn.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't.
I will never forget how my heart almost leaped from my chest when I saw him at the hospital.
Now I watch what's happening in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is coming to our country now, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one of the friendly countries, so how did we get together to fight together?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could pick up all the rebels and throw them away - as far as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who had taken a special commando
Saved: Alyonu Tskaevu leads to a safe Russian special team (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy.
The world in 2004 gasped when a small Alyonu carried a Russian policeman in his arms.
The terrorists had released her, but she had left her mother's mother, a ten-year-old sister Kristinu and brother Makhara in the school gym.
Makhar, who had been here for three years, had escaped, but the mother's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan had remarried, and with her new wife, she had a little girl who named Kristina after the dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, which is now ten, does not remember the attack at all, and she has grown a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend has said that "it is a great happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great children."
Ruslan is a good father, and he wants to keep the children away from the memories of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.
A man accused of turning girls into a sign in the village of Fife

Judge Charles Macnair set the date of the stall on January.
4 tips on how to get better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in shooting or filming underwater, you have a large selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or outdoorová kamera camera Hero3 + Silver Edition, costing around $300.
I took these photos to the family party of several cameras, all cost less than 350.
It doesn't matter what kind of equipment you use, but a few rules apply to the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure that batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes the exposure to the dark environment under water.
And before you go, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are only up to 5 feet, up to 50 to 60.
Read si našeho wizard purchase a evaluation digitálních kamer v ordinary i watertight implementation.
Always do a few slides - a lot of them won't work.
The compact cameras have LCD cameras, which will help you with photos, but they don't have it.
Although LCD has, under the water, it will be difficult to see and the composition of the picture will be nepředvidatelná.
So you always do more pictures.
Pokud má kamerou bracketingový systém, který doing series snímků s slightly different diffusion expozice, use toho.
Stay close to the surface.
In the deeper light of the light, the light grows considerably.
If this is possible, stay in the swimming pool, the lake or the sea close to the surface.
This will also allow you to catch more light on the photos - the deeper you will see, the less color you will see.
Get close to the fotografovanému object.
This is a good advice, if we do not land on land, but under water it is even more important for the light of the light.
It is particularly important if you deal with a camera camera: such devices usually have a fixed and wide angle of lenses, which means that if you want to fill fotorámeček, you must go closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality could change things even in such an enormous organization as NHS.
As his career, he devoted his career to a sick man from pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an officer of MI6 who had to live with the consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while the doctors were concentrating on diagnoses and illnesses, patients in the overwhelming majority were interested in something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May that year.
I felt free of energy.
He had learned the symptoms of the flu, and found that he was impatient, and his wife Juliet included remorse.
He said, "I want everything to happen sooner than later."
When Juliet had gone to business for a week, Lawson was uncharacteristically and inexplicably agitated.
Something was wrong.
My colleague did a chest X-ray.
Two weeks earlier in the French Alps.
The results of the X-rays came.
He had a mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that was affecting the pleura of his lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine what their cause was.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer have been smoking.
But the Mezoteliom is different.
Almost in all cases, it is the cause of exposure to asbestos - the construction of fibrous material that was previously described as "miraculous, " but now knows that it is deadly.
For most of us, it was hard to ignore.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry has entered into force.
Even at the time the asbestos was used, there were only certain groups of people in close contact with him, for example, construction insulation, construction, carpenters, and laborers at the shipyards.
toxin used in industry in another era now seems to be a cause for concern.
But such complacency is not in place.
As it turns out, in Britain, this is the climax of an epidemic epidemic.
The number of deaths per mesothelioma is higher than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths per disease per year is twice more than the number of victims of car accidents.
The number of deaths in the aftermath of the the year since 1980 and the estimated death in the UK in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are now experiencing its effects, although the use of asbestos is already illegal (all kinds of asbestos have been banned in 1999), is that it usually takes decades to develop.
The Cataclysm, in the form of the, does not only concern the veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases, it is still present in the homes we live in, in the offices where we are working, in schools, where we learn, and in shops where we buy.
Mezoteliom tedy respect social layer, wealth, profession ani age.
The privileged bastion from London's commercial houses to public schools do not pose a hideout.
Even Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even the hospital in which they should treat us is the repository of this mortal carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He didn't even think of isolation.
He tried to find out where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It's possible that there was a lot of asbestos in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All of them -- students, sisters, doctors, and doormen.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was the question he had been able to answer.
"From four doctors who were in Guy's Hospital, and in the past five years, " he said in a letter in 2010," I'm the only one still alive. "
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson had been diagnosed when he was 48.
It was 55 when he died on 17 February of this year.
Přežívat with this diagnosis is not the usual one.
55 percent of people diagnosed with malignant will die within eight months of diagnosis.
Sickness is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat the nagging question: "How many of us are sick of the same disease? "
According to the leading British expert on Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that there will be about 90 000 people die between 1970 and 2050.
Most of them now have no idea that he will die in this way.
Azbestový Mine in Quebec, Canada
When attempting to consult files from the archives of the courts, which often turn and require a settlement, it shows how much the disaster has spread.
For example, this June has given the company Marks & Spencer that it has been exposed to asbestos by Janice Janice.
For a string she worked for nine years, from 1978 to roku1987, when it was overseen in two stores in the clothing section - one of the places was the flagship of the company, the shop on Oxford Street.
It was only 18 when it began to work for M & S.
Today has two children who are over twenty.
"Before that happened," he says, "I've never heard of the before I knew anything about asbestos.
It had never occurred to me in the dream that he might somehow relate to me.
There are not many people who know about asbestos.
In fact, there is no asbestos, but a group of six minerals.
His name was given to his Debride structure, which gives him strength and strength.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
most je dnes v budov možné find chryzotil, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in the roof panels, flooring tiles, bojlerových těsněních, and even in the brake lining.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and the WHO still consider it a "high health risk " that can cause death.
However, More is a brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and the experts claim that "there is a compelling, but circumstantial evidence that this was the main cause of an unusually high incidence of the [in the United Kingdom]. "
Female Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the top of Oxford Street in London.
Janice Allen may not be regarded as a typical victim of the, but the work of Juliana Pete points out that her story is not unusual.
His studies of patients claim that "substantial part of the cases of the without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was likely to be caused by exposure to asbestos. "
A significant part of this exposure is caused by "normal use and zvětráváním " buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people at the heart of the government do not have to suspect that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard has published a report according to which service lifts and pipelines in the chambers of the Parliamentary Committee are contaminated with asbestos, whose fatal fibres could have been breached by something as harmless as a "strong air of air. "
Ministers are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but in this case it may be the opposite of the truth.
Although Parliament's services have insisted that the Westminster Palace receive a "positive medical certificate ," it is now that there will be one million pounds and a few years of work in order to ensure that Parliament has had a thorough overhaul, modernised electricity and removing asbestos, and that, after the elections in 2015, they will be more than green seats in Westminster at the premises of Queen Elizabeth II.
In the report, the report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in line with several regulations. "
It is not possible to say whether this non-compliance will cost the lives.
Everyone can only wait now.
One person who had never been able to determine when exposed to asbestos was Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspected that he was exposed to asbestos at work in hospitals.
"I worked at the hospital where the presence of asbestos was proved," he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked, and when he worked there.
Of course, he remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he felt something like chills.
He was 45, he was at night, and he was in the middle of an operation.
Suddenly I began to tremble.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I thought you were driving the car home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain was coming from pleura, lining around his lungs.
But like Janice Janice, he had no reason to believe that this was a mesothelioma.
He had spent a month at last.
The The doctors gave him a chest X-ray and led the sternum to remove the liquid from his lungs.
Yet there was no diagnosis.
His condition improved and returned to work.
From time to time, however, the symptoms had returned, often after they had taken their way.
In 2011, one of the patients with similar symptoms occurred in the operating room and was diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott had no connection with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older, and he had gotten into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, the Haitian state has deteriorated again, and his doctor has photographed his films from CT and X-ray with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, the probe was put in place in the space between the thoracic thoracic cavity and the lungs.
I'm an optimist.
I have a tendency to ignore nothing, "he says.
To be honest, I wasn't worried about that.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed s malignant
Abbott began to meet his sisters from the charitable organization of Macmillan, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have heat insulation in the pipeline," he says.
For people who have been exposed to these buildings, the disease is now beginning to show.
Thus, Mezoteliom is now beginning to relate to younger people who do not have a risky profession.
The most dangerous pipes of insulated asbestos in hospitals were in the basement, and it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, the members of staff who moved through the corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or were eating in the basement dining room (as often Graham Abbott) would have come into contact with the toxic substance.
As shown now, there were several decades after the war at the hospital, where they could save their lives, but also a place that could endanger the life of doctors who had been treated.
Asbestos se removes dodnes.
Žáci si The lamp built na asbestos washers
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and towns because of their excellent isolation and flame-retardant properties.
In the schools, too.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless hours of chemistry, the students were building a Bunsen lamp on a asbestos.
There has been a website dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of shelters for tools in our homes routinely contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with the asbestos on which the woman suffering from malignant could remember, in the 1970's, when she had a garden house.
So keep an eye on the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while before it happens," Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to go on, but I found that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to go and deal with myself.
Well, another Christmas party.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As a countless number of patients in front of him, he remembers how he felt confused about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand," he says.
"I asked my doctor," How much time do I have? "
I have been told that twelve months.
I remember, as I said, "Well, another Christmas party.
That's it. "
Mezoteliom is particularly destructive, because the mechanism itself that keeps us alive - the breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most of the cases are caused by exposure to asbestos.
small is a tiny thread.
When asbestos breaks and fibers the, they can settle in pleura, suit lungs.
Asbestos fibers are irritating and may cause a mutation of cells.
"The problem is vdechnutá asbestos fibers in the form of needles," says Professor Tom Treasure, surgeon, who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
In the same hospital, where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, and which is paradoxically the leading center in the treatment of the.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who have been exposed to asbestos during practice at the hospital.
Asbestos's asbestos are getting into the tissue of the lungs, says Treasure, and the respiration itself is pressed against the edge where it is located.
It is inherently invasive from the outset.
As a result, the normal treatment options used for other types of cancer do not work so much.
Hot is discussed, for example, the effectiveness of the operation.
According to some, it would be worth a try.
Treasure don't agree.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You can't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer "too does not respond to chemotherapy, which" has some effect, " but it does not cure.
"Sometimes there's someone who survives lung cancer," says Treasure.
But they would all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
The author of Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years from his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott was still fighting.
Po findings the se Abbott contact s Andrew contact, který se, 4 letech od své diagnosis, become individual support a adviser pro as people.
When they called, he said cheerfully, "Good day, you are at the center of cancer."
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
His illness was four years old, and he was still very active.
At the beginning of the Abbott, they offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and would probably prolong his life only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson was able to show things in the dim light. "
After he had visited several physicians, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduskim from the thoracic surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage that I didn't have to wait until they sent me to him, but I just called and they didn't get me," Graham admits.
The normal patient would have to get a and have to approve the remuneration.
In order to be able to get to the best available treatment, it is crucial for patients with a credible question of money.
But when different treatments inevitably fail, many patients face further financial concerns - the future of the family they leave.
And that is why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse.
"Since 1898, it was known that asbestos was harmful," said Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even its very small quantities could pose a health risk.
And here we meet the negligence of the firms.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital met at last, but according to Morgan it was not a "full settlement, " because Lawson could not definitively prove that mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos in Guy's Hospital.
However, following the investigation of the case, the spokeswoman Guy's Hospital has confirmed that "asbestos in the the section was removed in the 1990's. "
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Svádět exposure to fatal asbestos to one company or job of work - usually dozens of years after that has happened - for patients with malignant seeking compensation proved to be a huge problem.
Many former workplaces have changed the owner or failed.
The insurance policy has been lost.
And those who are now defending themselves have the time on their side, which is certainly not the case.
In response to this fact, new legislation has been approved this year, which makes it easier for patients to seek redress, even if their former employer cannot be traced.
The law has created 350 million of the financial reserve, which is paid by the insurance company, and which is addressed to people after July 2012, who can demonstrate that they have been exposed to asbestos, but they do not have to sue.
In this case, they will receive 80% of the amount that they would, in their normal case, be treated as compensation - about 120,000 pounds.
For each year, 300 successful applications are expected.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with malignant, thinks that 350 million pounds is a "good job. "
"It is an agreement made by the insurance companies for insurance companies," it says, and points out that the sum is a quarter of what the insurance companies would have to pay if it hadn't intervened, and people with malignant would be able to find the former employer and the normal way to sue them.
Even Mike Penning, the former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had gaps."
But Penning and Morgan concede that, in view of the seven deaths each year, there was a need for rapid action.
"People are suffering too much and help now," said Penning in December last year during the second reading of the Law on the.
Graham Abbott was in charge of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunskiho for 19 months.
After the initial consultation, he recommended a Lang-Lazdunski operation which, unlike Tom Treasura, thought it had a positive effect.
After surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - triple therapy, for which the Lang-Lazdunski could boast of the survival rate of five years up to 40% of patients.
The Abbott strengthened it.
"Of course, that's not the most important thing," said Abbott.
You can see it all the time.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition may deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent an operation in March 2012.
In late August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The inspection surveys did not show any symptoms of disease.
On the next check, I went in March [2014].

At present, there are no traces of tumor in his body.

As for Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) this is not always easy.
"It's hard for the parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant that I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is a lot of social and wild.
She told the friends, and suddenly we started calling a lot of people.
Ellie was paralyzed.
She didn't say much.
All patients with cancer must face such talks.
In patients with malignant, however, such talks are not a hopeful hope or only a hint of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually it brought Stephen Jay Gould) to make sure.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma's life does not threaten. "

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
In spite of the debate, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to put the candidates in the election in 2017.
It is likely that this move will cause long overdue protests in Hong Kong, as activists have begun to organize and prepare only a few hours after this announcement.
Indeed, China's popular congress allows the communist leaders to dismantle any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We weren't surprised, but it angered us," Emily Lau Lau, the Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The people in Hong Kong lied.
And it is clear that we have something to do with the authoritarian regime.
In defence of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei-hung, said that, in order to allow a public nomination in the election of Hong Kong, it would cause "chaos. "
From 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong to Hong Kong, it promised Beijing that, from 2017, the citizens would be able to vote the executive power.
China's leaders have presented a Sunday decision as a democratic breakthrough, because Hong Kong allows a direct vote, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders hold firm in the hands of the nominations committee, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And, according to a new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong " will be eligible.
The decision came after the summer months, which had seen one of the biggest and most protests in Hong Kong in a few years.
Za majority protests protests v Hong is occupation occupation Central s love a peace, který organisers threatened as financial of, když nám Beijing not general right right.
On Sunday night, only a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the occupation movement in the rain were gathered before the government of Hong Kong.
On the demonstration, the organizers reported that their movements enter into a new phase of civil disobedience, and that waves of protest will begin in the coming weeks.
But there were no other details, apparently wanting to avoid problems with the authorities.
In its internet announcement, the organizers said that the movement "considered the occupation of Central only as a last step in the event that all the possibilities of dialogue will be exhausted and there will be no other choice.
We must regret that, today, all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted, and the occupation of Central is inevitable.
In Hong Kong, the authorities in Hong Kong had prepared for days, and had reinforced the protection of the government's headquarters and police officers and barricades on Sunday.
under Encourage je podle many of Hong mark, že slowly slowly nad městem.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in products and services.
There are also fears that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the occupation of the occupation of the occupation, and they say that their demonstrations threaten the trade - the lifeboat of Hong Kong.
"The protest that he talks might cause much greater economic damage, depending on how many people will attend and for how long," says politician Regina Ip, who criticizes the movement for a long time.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong gets out of control.
Such perceptions could damage the investment.
In recent days, China's media has come up with reports that the democratic activists in Hong Kong portray as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer of activists, they organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights, with 780 000 participants - more than one-fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the biggest pro-demokratických demonstrations in the history of the region.

Liga v Jihlava wear název podle political movement
A soccer plays v Court městem Highlands asi 1 600 amatérských athletes.
And their highest competition is newly appointed together for the Jihlavu League.
The name came from one movement that goes to the October of municipal elections.
, na jeho ticket je dále boss boss boss v Jihlava Jan Mráka.
"It was a general meeting where there was no problem," said Mráka.
lawyers around the first league of small football has already been dealt with by lawyers in the city hall and recommended a change in the distribution system.
Little soccer had won around a million crowns last year.
This year, this year is the sum of the hundreds of thousands.
According to the rule of law, the practice of small football is not contrary to the law or directives of the magistrate.
However, the situation is a stimulus for the rules on the allocation of grants and subsidies, 'said the spokesperson of the magistrate Radek Tulis.
Draw dotace od města a time express jako small football support ve volbách one political, to už asi't.
On the vysočinský "big" football, unlike politicians, has not yet come.
ČSSD ČSSD regional, ODS Division, or KDU-ČSL 1.
And the class and the similar contests?
I wouldn't be for it.
On the contrary, I would like to see the sponsors of the companies, "the Chairman of the Regional Football Union said Miroslav Vrzáček.
The head of the little football of another party and the movement in the name of the league will not allow
According to football players, this sport in Jihlava has earned its own area with six playgrounds, unvented and social facilities.
"For example, the field isn't ours, we're in the rental," Ondřej attention said from the club Starlet Jihlava.
The most suitable site would be the Czech windmill.
But there will be, for example, in my opinion, an absurd area for skateboarders, which is about fifty, "he pointed out.
Primátor Jihlava Jaroslav erased (ODS) reacted, že small football used field s artificial grass v ulicích Rošického a na Stoupách, které jsou v assets města.
We want to build a field that has a maximum use.

I think that for a little soccer, it has made great progress in recent years, "he added.
Other political parties in the names of the leagues will not appear, according to Jana Mráky.
We have restrictions.
If one of you can join us in the partnership, we don't give the other one, "he explained.
"A political movement in the name of the League, I consider this at least an unfortunate step," said a member of the town-hall Commission for sport, Karel Voldán.
"However, the voters will assess whether Mr. Mráka is using the League of Small Football and subsidies for political purposes, or not," he added.
Americká tradice into do university life - freshmen může fly jet plane
We are glad that we can respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel services for students in Britain.
For the purpose of leaving the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers the possibility of transport, including private jets or vehicles of Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service had its security side.
Servicing is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their things over the entire state in a dangerous car.
Těšíme se s, ((velmi important fresher - velmi important fresher) variants této rok studenty we, že na univerzitě arrive s minimum nervousness a maximum luxury.
The spokesman said that, given that the services were still running, they had no reservations yet, but he added, "Students start making reservations over the next few weeks."
The company also stated that, although students pay an annual tuition of GBP 9 000, it is expected that the service will find its place on the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today's students are different from expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the programme programme is exactly the appropriate way to achieve this.
However, the National Union has criticised the service as a reach.
Megan Megan, Vice-President of the Union for higher education, said, "For most students, such a project is unattainable.
A lot of students embarking on the university before they throw a thousand pounds for something as simple as arriving on the track, coping with the financial crisis, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants is unable to keep pace with rising costs for basic needs.
Feminists se po dění ve Fergusonu building v racism a behaviour police
At the beginning of the month, a policeman killed an unarmed young man in the Missouri.
The people waiting for the funeral with their hands up, "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protest in Missouri in Missouri because of the firing of an unarmed young man, Michael Brown, he saw Miriam Zoila a shift shift in the internet discourse of white feminists.
She has found that, when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and equality of income, it favors white feminists against the race.
With increasing tension in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, she noticed that the reaction of the white was centered at 100% on the race.
V compared s reactions soon soon po shooting 9. srpna se personal Articles s headings jako "thought white nad Ferguson" nebo "Feminism není jen o oppression women" appeared relatively relatively.
According to constraints, this represents an important change.
"I don't think there are too many people who would talk about the race and privileges at such level," she said.
People felt that what had happened had to be said.
For the crisis that we are facing, it is characteristic because [the situation in Fergusonu] is so racially that it must be pointed out.
According to the professor of English at the State University in Ohio Korithy Mitchell, Ferguson had taken on the light of the problems that de-selected had to face every day and which, in the cultural sphere, are not perceived as "feminine questions. "
"On Facebook, I can publish funny stories from life with your partner and get it 150 liků from all over the world," Mitchell said.
When I write about the fact that the colored are trapped in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How is it possible that a woman can talk about relationships, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
Pro black jako je Mitchell, které se address question race, gender a sexuality v Americe historii, není mezi issues race a gender dichotomy.
According to her, they could not afford the luxury of reading these problems: each day they live in this mixed reality.
Although white today's the issue of race and gender in mainstreamových set circles, Angela Hatteryová, Professor speakers of a woman's question and gender study at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, there were at least 10,000 black Negroes, and the reason was almost in all cases of rape, "said Hatteryová.
To justify the lynching, you needed the cooperation of the white.
According to the Hatteryové schism between the white and the black, when a warrior for electoral law, as Susan B. Anthony, had examined the terrain at the end of the 19th century, and realized that only one group of people - women or Negroes can have the electoral right.
"They decided to gamble on the voting rights for women, and for the right to the blacks," she explained.
If we recognize this, we will have an important insight into why the coloured women do not trust the white.
We did a good job.
We never helped protect their husbands and children.
Even after the women had gained electoral rights in 1920, it was ten years before they began to organise themselves against the lynching in the Association of Women's Association for the Prevention of the lynching.
The group was created for 40 years after the first time they had called for help.
According to the escalation of the reaction of white feminists on the issues that occurred in the Fergusonu, the question of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects the time when the white feminists had to "catch up " the issues with which the generation had fought.
"Wouldn't it be great if the people on these spaces [traditional feminism] have the right to raise a child as seriously as the right to contraception?" said Mitchell.
The second wave of feminists, which has made a career struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraception, is now finding out what that means.
Significant feminist activist jako Gloria care take TWO weeks po shooting Michaela Brown attack Facebook, kde public column Rebecca Carrollové z Guardian, která se demanded toho, aby white Americans more protested protested against.
"I hope that women who have different, but similar reasons for understanding the dangers of society - and the views of the race that are markedly different in opinion polls - will seek change," she wrote.
Although care holds intersekcionální feminism, which includes both the Race and the sexes, its comments on the question of the Race in America are confusing.
Odbornice from the American Enterprise Institute Christina Christine, author of "Who stole feminism? " she said to the People, that the young men in the United States, especially young men, are" far more vulnerable than their sisters, " but the remarks of the extremist parties are facing criticism that they have brought before.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost no one for the boys.
But when the White House launched a small program My Brother 's Keeper, who was supposed to help vulnerable young Negroes and Hispáncům, it brought up with many feminists, including Gloria's furious reaction.
The police relationship with the black community is not the only problem that is in the forefront of the interest of the mainstreamového feminism.
After the American border police held this year to the south-west of the country of nearly 63 000 teenagers, the question of reform of immigration law was once again - this time as a woman's question.
Andrea Mercadová, Co-Chair We Belong Together, kteří mobilising women pro reform immigration laws, said, že aby bylo možné question jako pro women necessary, only, co had had, bylo share stories immigrants.
"They speak for themselves," says Mercadová.
In view of the fact that most of the work permits are granted to men, women who come with them will find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have resonance in women's organizations," she said.

They threatened to burn the car.
That's why the Barum Rally ended up
What exactly happened?
There was a defect in the material.
The car was completely new, so I didn't think it could happen.
Can't the tailpipe be repaired and continue at a slower pace to the service where the mechanics would exchange it?
If we went straight up there, yes.
But we were still waiting for two more erzety, and that was impossible.
There's a high temperature in it, and the risk that the car would start to burn was great.
I can't afford that.
At your full rate, you managed five speed tests.
What did you think of them?
Very good.
I felt like a young man.
We were fast, but I didn't go through the vint.
Everything was caused by the fact that the car was more than half a year, so that it was at some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You told him so that you could realistically think of victory.
I and the car had been prepared by the fact that we really had the winnings.
The work had not been wasted.
On the other hand, the result we could think of.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technology said no.
You were not the only one who had resigned from the fight for primacy.

He drove fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the launch of Barum rally.
Can you make a good sense of the ride back to a regular participant in the rallyových race?
Not at this point.
Last year, I said that Barumka was my last race, and I didn't keep it.
I decided to take her back.
It was my here start, and if there's a chance in a year, I guess I'm going to go.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people have reached the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy that?
To a certain extent, we were just because of them.
A lot of people, acquaintances or unknowns, always asked me if I was going to go.

An oral agreement with the employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you have not been able to post confirmation from a doctor who serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform working duties on health grounds.
In addition, you did not notify the employer immediately.
Subsequently, it was agreed that the days would be recorded as a holiday, but the agreement was carried out only orally.
Although the Code of Conduct does not impose an obligation to allow the employer's consent to be confirmed in writing, in practice, this procedure has been proven.
If there is only oral agreement, you do not have a certificate agreement.
Thereafter, the alleged consent of a holiday can be considered, as in your case, invalidated and absence in work as a long-term absence of absences, hence the reason for the immediate cancellation of the employment relationship under Section 53 of the Code of Conduct.
In the case of a dispute concerning a disagreement with the employer, the employer is so lacking in demonstrable evidence.
However, the working relationship with you has not been cancelled under § 53, only you have a given day in the zápočtovém sheet as a first.
The absence of an absence in a zápočtovém sheet does not have the same effects as § 53 (e.g. the impossibility of acquiring material security in unemployment), yet it is the possibility of seeking a new job.
It is recommended that you visit your doctor again in writing to confirm that there has actually been an accident, as a result of which you have been incapacitated (this is not called "neschopenku," it is only evidence of a doctor).
In the search for a new job, you can submit this document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate to consider how to issue a written medical certificate of incapacity, so early notification of the employer or request of a written consent with the drawing of a holiday.
There are no complications of any kind of complications.
Tony Stewart's accident at the return to the track
The return on the track ended up for Tony Stewart just a little over half of the racing track of Atlanta Motor The.
For the second time, Stewart bumped into the line after the real front tire broke in his lap, and the race ended.
Stewart drove the wrecked car into the garage, and the reporters made no comment and left.
The head of his team, Chad Johnston said that a team of cars 14 is disappointed, but will now concentrate on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I wish we had better performance and a better conclusion," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond, and we'll hope that there will be more.
Stewart had encountered the first time in the Sunday evening race after the collision with the Kyle Buschem, which required a repair of the right side of his car.
"We put a chance of good endings to this race," Johnston said, and added, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, the car was loaded and the team was loaded and ready to depart.
After his car hit and killed another driver at the factory in New York, he left Stewart three races of NASCAR Sprint Sprint.
He decided to return this weekend, and he needed to win either a race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch up in the table.
He had returned to racing during the investigation of the tragic accident, which had died of twenty Ward Jr., who had taken the Stewart during the race.
The authorities have said that there will be at least another two weeks to investigate the causes of the accident.
So far, it has not been decided that Stewart will face some accusations.
The Triple champion had a warm cheer before the race.
Stewart started at the 12th place, at the start of the race on the 10th, and then even at 4.
Then, at the start of the spinning wheel, the Buschovo car No.
18 got out of control, got out of the second curve and bumped into the Stewart, so that the two of the wagons had sent them to the fence.

But then it seemed to us that the water did not smell.
It occurred to us if there was something wrong.
In the place where the pump was going, it was possible, with some bad luck, there was a plate, so there was a hole in a piece of bricks.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing to be seen in the water, and we stuck it down to the bottom.
So we released it once more and again.
We have, of course, improved the improvised seals around the tubing of the pump.
We noticed some strange things in the cellar.
There was a sticky package on the ground.
That's what it looked like.
And some more.
Now it looked like a slimy mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where the vents, the first invention, were the remnants of the fish!
And heavily!
Our cellar is quirky, too.
Someone would have said that Grandpa had simply rented a cabin.
And it wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and floors are only sand sand, only the ceiling is podbitý.
There are mostly ships in there.
And the wheels.
And the couches on the beach.
The gates with wide spaces were mostly open, as someone had walked in one piece.
At the ceiling, several of these vents have already been mentioned.
Without the nets, so there are normally birds, and they build nests on the rafters.
There's no need to mention the mouse.
Granddad wanted it to be luftovalo, and that was it.
Now, however, he did not help.
The whole cellar of smelled.
So we cleaned up the whole cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nourishing!
We had thrown out the things that were about: the boards, the heraklitovou, and so.
Náš cabin na distance welcomed passersby disinfectant odérem.
Did we think of the disgusting remnants of the drag?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
It's hard to come up with us.
The Grandpa attacked a neighbor who wasn't quite all right.
If he's the one who's going to give us the disgusting air?
It's practically all over a year, stupid ideas, he's got it.
We have chosen the cellar and the well to watch and check on a regular basis.
After a few days, everything was all right.
We started to use water again, except for washing and washing before the tests were done, but that was good.
There's nothing I want to do for a long time.
One day we heard a terrible anxiety bark of our bitches.
Momma looked from the balcony and saw a long, thick black hose on the grass beside the porch.
She hopped over it and squealed like a fool.
Mom told her, because she thought she'd dug up a waste hose from the sink.
But suddenly the hose was partly wedged into a ball, and she straightened in part.
There was a hiss on the balcony.
Reza had hysterics.
We went down.
A long, long, long way over a meter and fat, she was about to swallow a huge toad, and she resisted it.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was immaterial.
When she saw the odds in the form of our family, she must have said so, let her know when we were such a hladi, and gracefully stretched out into the cellar.
We flew to her.
Like lightning, she dived for the well.
Just by the way, we noticed another stinking package on her board.
Judging by the smell of the fish.
The day before yesterday was not there!
Our new security around the pumps was a little messed up.
And that's the cellar of the locked over the day.
It would...
We went out and went to one of the vent.
We weren't expecting a long time.
Beyond the wells, the There.
At first there was a flat letterhead with yellow period on his neck.
Then she vaulted to the well of the well.
They clustered around the pumps and began to scramble in.
Vyhozený employee se revenge, bought na firmu notebooks a sold je
The staff member, after the release, was purchased on the company's computer, and then sold them.
The money had taken place before the detention of the police.
During a short period of time, the man had purchased in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers in more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"Notebooks after taking over to Olomouc, where he was sold after the bazaars," said the senior commissioner of the šumperské police, Rostislav Rostislav.
motive fraud was revenge for the employer for release, as well as the profit of money.
"He told us that money was used on loan payments," said Brückner.
The police also discovered that the impostor was a pathological gambler who had repeatedly treated psychiatry.
So the money could have ended in lottery, or at videoloterijních terminals.
"The fact is that we haven't found any money at him," said the Commissioner.
Podvodníkovi, who had once been punished for theft, now threatens to stay in prison for a period of up to five years.
The police had not yet questioned whether the punishment of the punishment, which had bought the notebooks below the price, was selling them.
"It is true that we do not have new goods, which is at least suspicious," said the Commissioner.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar has yet been charged.
Come on, a little more, you can do it, or how I used We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have made a number of changes to us.
The biggest was the change in the route that brought the target to shallows, instead of leading back to the yellow spa.
I was looking forward to the rest of the team's team, but I was about to get it out of the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to get our readers into the booth, where we worked together and made videos.
To achieve my view from the other side, I accepted the role of personal conductors.
Together with a friend of friend, we put it obediently on the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes.
We made friends with friends who walked past us into the sector for a quicker runner.
There wasn't much time left.
A few of on warm-up, turn on sporttestery, countdown, and start!
Cries of cheering, but instead of fast takeoff, was followed by a clatter to the starting line.
After five minutes, they reached for the gate, measuring the measurements, and accelerating at an hour ten.
Proplétáme with the yellow snake of the runners, who, like the Katya, runs their first race.
In the meantime, they all look fresh, slowly descending the sun in the sky, giving the view to the Vyšehrad.
The mass of meat running along the waterfront looks as if the whole of Prague was running here.
Na waterfront mezi Vyšehrad a National theatre se tradičně begins show, kteří má has forces.
light a na Palackého náměstí to many runners slow nebo to do walk.
Just before I go to the theatre, I can see a police escort, and at the end of the day, the Vítek is flying at an incredible pace to the goal.
I hear the admiring sighing of the other runners.
If you go to the edge of the line, get him out of the line, he's going to slap me, but just before that, my leg is stuck, and our hands are just passing.
Seběh Theater Street provides a chance for a brief rest and a rozdýchání.
It is necessary, before us, there are places on which the projections will take my breath.
The The on the Mánesově Bridge shows Prague in the whole beauty of the setting sun.
Nedýchám and feet carry me almost alone.
There is a moment of truth in the first občerstvovačkou.
In the rollover of the road, the road tripped over the curb and shows the jump of the dive.
I see if she doesn't need help, and a I series of encouraging words, so that she doesn't have time to think about pain.
's se's a we down down, je to one z inroads jobs track, v této závod závod už není such of, ale je ale need well okolí.
I have no idea that the concept of the narrowest place will gain its true importance later.
Za dusty gate nás frenetic encourage tourists i friends dalších runners.
I'm trying to deal with everyone who offers a hand, and I advise it, because ten fans with fans are like half the energy bars.
It does work, once again, and even though we have had a great deal of it, it began to race.
There are dozens of runners, when I find someone especially tired, trying to cheer him up in a few words, "Come on, you can do it!"
No one has ever seen us in the past, accelerating.
We've been running for an hour and a quarter, we, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the target will hurt, but there is a need for really.
The sun had gone down again, and the race ended in the end of the day.
The last stretch on the bridge, the turn, and the stretch.
The tempo that amazes me, amazes me, where does this girl take it?
"Come on, let's go under an hour thirteen, working!" I called.
We're trying, sprint, and there's a target.
Hour thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
Coach has set up an hour twenty.
So, seven minutes under the plan.
Which is a great result.
Just in the end of the target, I'm helping her to the railing, where she's resting.
It can be seen by exhaustion, but also good luck.
After a moment, she moved slowly out of the scope of the target.
euphoria doesn't make us think of the crowds in the passages of the toward.
Here we can see that the Goat's alley was not the narrowest place.
That is for the purpose of the walled, which is below the onslaught of almost ten thousand runners.
If anyone doesn't like crowds, it's not a place for him.
I am losing my head for a moment, and I wonder if these magnificent views, and over the past years of a more interesting route, was worth what was happening in the target.
From my experience, I know that the organization of the race is not funny.
Pokud k tomu add ten tisíc lidí, rich accompanying program a conclusion všech centre Prahy pro všechny transport, je z toho huge call.
This year's change in the route has shown many interesting places, but it also brought some very unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere of the rozpumpovaná in the yellow Spa moved between the runners and the plant itself.
The organizers around the track, as well as the random spectators, set it on every subway line.
Unfortunately, at urban events, the historic centre must be able to deal with obstacles that cannot be removed, but the target of a mass plant in a place that is on the one side of the wall and on the other river, I do not consider the best solutions.
If I tell you that the race ended up with a proběhnutím goal, I consider it as a very good one.
In the end, I had a little worried about the health of the people, but at last all went well.
Write us into the discussion, if you like the route, and what you say about the situation in the target.
Moreover warders in Bulgaria organise protests
Hundreds of staff of prison services in Bulgaria have participated in the nationwide protest Assembly before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
On a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions that have changed recently.
There are higher salaries in the list of requirements to be dealt with by the Interim Minister of Justice.
The Peacekeepers protested symbolically against the new working time, demanding a return to the original twenty čtyřhodinovým In.
Although the trade guards' unions and the authorities of the Ministry of Justice have met, they did not agree, they informed the Bulgarian state radio (NBR).
"The negotiations are still ongoing," said NBR to the Chief Justice of the prison service, Rosen Zhelyazkov.
They are expected to join the protests of the prison service by the members of the Federation of Trade Unions of staff at the Ministry of the Interior.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we can't see them
physicists usually write write, ale Brian Green z Columbia univerzity se v roce 1999 had shot do black.
His book, the Elegant Universe, became a as on the way to penetrate the thicket of a series of theoretical physicists - trying to unify two brilliantly functioning, but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Male universe is that, in the case of searching for a unified physical theory, it is not a dull story.
There is a fundamental problem between two key theories (for this moment, our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) to deal with it so that it stands for both retelling and layman.
In addition, Greene had consulted the complex material, and said that he could not blame him for how much he had not included in his book.
In addition, its "error" has been rectified in two other books: the structure of the universe and the Hidden Reality.
Not even the author would have objected to his book more quickly, but the fact is that, even after 15 years of the Elegant Universe, it is increasingly important that an informed layman with ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that, in the next few years, it will be more lively in this area (perhaps due to the fact that the accelerator will come at last on "full throttle"), and so it is a good time to enter the Green open door of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe has more than three dimensions of space may sound foolish, fantastically, oddly or mystically.
Nevertheless, it is concrete and quite acceptable.
In order to understand this, let us not forget our vision from the universe as a whole to something, namely a long and thin garden hose.
Imagine a one-hundred-metre garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other, and the whole of you are watching from a distance (as in the picture and on the next page).
From this distance, you can easily notice a long horizontal line in the horizontal direction, but if it is you bystrozrakostí, the thickness of the hose is barely visible.
In view of its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant compelled to live on a hose has only one dimension in which it can pass: a levo-pravý dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where an ant was in a given moment, you answer only one indication: the distance of an ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional.
In the real world, the hose has a thickness.
If all the we, the see suddenly the second dimension - in the shape of a circle of a around hose.
In such a clear view, it is clear that an ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: a well known Left-Right dimension after the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension" in the direction of moving counterclockwise, "around the kruhovéhoprůřezu hose.
You are beginning to understand that in order to determine the position of a small soft you must specify two figures: how far from the end of the hose and where there is a circle hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is 2D (note by experts that this chapter concentrates purely on the strings of string theory.
Neporuchové aspects are discussed by the 12th and 13th chapter.).
The surface of the hose is 2D: one long longitudinal dimension is illustrated by a straight arrow, a dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked by a circular arrow, is short and coiled.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The length of the hose is long and easily visible.
The Size circumference of the hose is short, "curled" and the less noticeable.
In order to realise the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates the important property of the spatial dimension.
The fact that they are divided into two groups.
They may be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or, on the other hand, small, rolled and much more difficult.
Of course, in that case, we are just trying to uncover the "the" dimension of the around thickness of the hose.
It was enough to take the binoculars.
But if the hose was thinner - like a hair or a capillary, we would have uncovered the dimension only with great effort.
In 1919, the Kaluza sent an article in 1919, with the astounding idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three of us all known dimensions.
You claim justifying justifying tím, že additional dimenze provides elegant a convincing framework, v které lze Einstein general relativity a Maxwellovu electromagnetic teorii surreal do only, united conceptual struktury.
At once, the question arises as to how this perceptive point is, with the obvious fact, that we are seeing the three dimensions of the space.
The answer which the Kaluza had silently assumed between the lines and which he had clearly voiced and explained the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, standing and falling with the assertion that the spatial geometry of our universe could have both large and rolled dimensions.
This means that, as well as the dimensions of the length of the hose, our universe has large, large and slightly visible three dimensions, the existence of which we are aware of each moment.
But, with a circular circuit of a garden hose, the universe can have an extra dimension, tightly coiled into space so small that they still remain hidden in front of our sleekest experimental experimental.
In order to get a clearer picture of the merits of a remarkable proposal, a few moments later on the hose.
Imagine a large number of circles in the circumference of the hose.
distance looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With binoculars now, thanks to the drawing, we will find the the dimension even more easily, we will see the theme from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is 2D, with one dimension large and almost limitless and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein had come up with the idea that our universe had a similar structure, but in addition to one small circular dimension, there were three large spatial dimensions, together with čtyřiprostorovédimenze.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
In order to help our imaginations, let us read the illustrations on the obr.3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
Na obrázku zoom look na geometry Area, jako jsme sheep-lords surface surface.
Each of the following levels represents an enormous magnification of the geometry of the area from the level of the previous.
Our universe can have an additional dimension (we see them at the fourth level of enlargement), if they are placed in a sufficiently small space; so we can explain that we are still seen.
The Square network shows a commonly known "large" dimension, while a circle of a new, tiny, and the dimension.
Just like a thread of thread in a densely carpeted carpet, and these circles exist in each place of normal proportions - only for the sake of the vividness plot only to the in a square net.
The background image 4 shows the commonly known structure of the space - the ordinary world around us - in these ordinary scales, such as meters, shown aside a small diamond in a square net.
For each of the following images, we shall focus on the small area of the image preceding; it shall not be visible in order to become visible.
At first, nothing is happening, as we can see at the top of the first levels of enlargement.
However, when it comes to its path beyond the geometry of the geometry of the space, on the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3, the see suddenly new, into the shape of a circle of the dimension, a similar loops thread in a densely carved piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein had come up with the idea that an additional circular dimension existed in each direction in the direction of large dimensions, as well as the hose of a circular circuit at each point of its length.
V interest In jsme circular dimension plot jen v certain, regularly deployed points.
Figure 4 Kaluzovu and Klein image of the microscopic structure of the geometry structure summarizes.
The similarity with the hose is clear, even though there are important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far apart spatial dimensions (from which we are only two), whereas the hose has a large dimension only one.
It is even more important that we are talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just about an object inside the universe, about our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
Pokud je additional coiled coiled dimension extremely miniature, recognize je is - jako jako circular circuit hose - více harder než watch obvious, large a enterprise dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is sufficiently small, it will reveal it in reality, even above the strength of our most modern instruments.
However, the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not merely a domed hummock within normal dimensions, as illustrated by the illustrations.
A circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three normal large dimensions.
It is a dimension to the remaining three dimensions independent, such as the dimensions of top-down, zleva-vpravo, and zepředu-dozadu independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions, and we need four data to identify its position, except for the three usual positions in the circular dimension; if and time, then five, in any case more than we would normally expect.

To our surprise, therefore, we find that, although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions, it shows Kaluzovo and Klein that this does not preclude the existence of additional neolithic proportions if they are sufficiently small.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see by the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment is able to identify the structures of a large a billionth meter.
The smaller rolled dimension can hardly be observed.
In 1926, Klein's original Kaluzův had an idea of several ideas about the nascent quantum mechanics.
Its calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension could have a size of approximately one length of length, the size of it as far as the distinctive abilities of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions of Kaluzovou-Kleinovou theory.

You can start with practicing on one string.
"The Rhythmic model is up to you, you can think of anything, just to apply it to the harmonic model of the 12," says Honza.
If you add another chord, you can see the figure again.
All you need to do is listen and watch what you can do with the dvanáctkovou harmony on two strings, and it's starting to sound like that.
If you make a third chord, you can dance with the melody of some songs.
When you finally add a fourth, watch for a change of debugging, it is pointed out by Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonice and try to put it together with the the.

Another goal without waiting?
Na large slavení to není, recognises their Dvořák
We take the point, and we like it.
The first half of us had more chance of us, the other landlord, "the assailant said, this time the scored kick.
Weren't you nervous about him, but he was accompanied by a great whistle?
Somehow, I wasn't aware of it, although on the other gate, where domestic fans were, it would probably have been worse.
You've paid for half an hour, but you've got the goal from penalty in less than four minutes.
What happened?
We started the beginning, we were passive, came from that corner, and then penalty.
After that you got up, and the first half of you were a better team, with more chances.
Why did it change after the intermission?
It's hard to say.
I agree with the fact that we played well after inkasovaném goal.
In the cabin, we said we wanted to maintain the tempo of the game, but we couldn't.
To tell the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it was also true that they had said something about their game, and they weren't very happy about it.
You are only the first time at the playground, while you haven't even got a goal at home.
Why is that different?
I don't think it's a difference, but it matters to us how to deal with it.
V Brně jsme well, ale pak to bylo od nás bad, Plzeň, to je other kategorie.
The four games you were waiting for a goal, weren't you afraid it might be like this after the last match?
Not really, but, of course, we're glad we don't have to talk about waiting for a goal.
Now we have added more without waiting, but they are still only three in six matches, which is not yet on a large scale.
Iceland - lava flows from the kilometers of the distant crater.
Lava goring to the surface in the area of Holuhraun near the glaciers of the Glacier, through the underground tunnel from the kilometers of the distant crater.
It's under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned tunnel.
This is now the fact that the scientists are concerned about the most...
For the moment, the situation remains unchanged.
Yesterday morning (31.
 (2014) still Pits from the fissure approximately the same amount of lava.
However, in contrast to the original estimates, it is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 je až times greater.
But scientists fear that the magma tunnel could be opened even in places where it is under the ice.
If this would happen, moreover, with a similar intensity that shows the current eruption, it would mean huge flooding, both on the river Jökulsá and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption, there is a strong reek of sulfur, clouds of steam and gas rising from the cracks.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as it was in the case of the eruption of Fimmvörðuháls in 2010.
This is much bigger, and there is much more gas, "says vulkanolog Ármann Höskuldsson.
But the weather had improved considerably since yesterday, and in the morning it was in the area of almost no wind.
Traces of sand storms were streaked with rain.
Scientists can continue their work.

He had drawn his attention to his shining cloak.
The Acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the US.
Po 1. world war se tak to to many many war pilots.
But because of the great number of fatalities, it was forbidden.
Today, however, it is coming back to the agenda for air days.
After takeoff, Peggy comes out of the cockpit on the upper wing.
It shows a variety of exercises.
At the end of the performance, it will move into space between the wings of the aeroplane, where its show continues, "he described Luděk Matějíček from the chebského Ultralight Club and the organizer organizer.
The airliner of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy was the main program of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang was the legendary on on the cake.
The legendary fighter was on the surface with the Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in tow (so-called).

Lucie thongs: Dramatic return to the camera!
However, parental responsibility has been replaced by Lucie thongs at least for tonight's work.
Stress or nervousness - blonde presenter obviously doesn't know any of this.
The news of the TV news was as good as if she hadn't stopped him for two months!
It's only two weeks since the blonde ended in the puerperium, in which women experience the greatest stress.
However, in the main reporting session of the TV Nova, he would not be able to show it.
The return of her return awaits her from information to the moon.
After all, her daughter Linda needs more than a TV audience.

Exhibition za rok v Praze?

It would be dignified if something had happened during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the Union will stand up, "he said, in the Jihlava after exhibition, with the name of the Golden Game, in which the glorious naganský team had once again met.
Even the players who participated in the golden hattricku.
Players would like it, didn't they?
Sure.
It would simply be good to make farewell to the golden generation during the championships.
According to me, they'll be able to find one two days during the tournament, when it is a full day off and where such a match could be made.

But what if you play with New Jersey?
So if you don't...
You don't want to play a representation but you don't.
Or had it somehow altered your decision?
representation a exhibition utkání jsou two different a v representation jsou decisive performance.
One thing is that people like to see me, but they are critical, especially in the World Cup.
There should be the players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
So, how did you enjoy the reunion?
Only the meeting with the players was great.
A man revived stories, and he had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us.
But the most important was the honor of Ivan Ivan.
And it is good to remind the history of our hockey, and that it leaves one generation that really was worth it.

Do you still have your first match for the game?
He doesn't forget such things.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we boarded in one threesome.
For all, it was the first start to start.
Well, of course, we wouldn't be able to say that.
At the very long time, Dominic had caught hold of Dominic Hašek.
What did you say about his performance?
I'm never surprised at the ice on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to the critique, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jágr for the reasons why he decided to end up in representation).
Even the Hnilička had a great show.
He was excersize with me once in the night, and there was a holes.
And now he caught the terrific.

Finally, we will devote ourselves to what we want to do.
Now we will concentrate on the Netherlands.

However, these results were not yet important.
That's right now.
Zápasem with the Netherlands will start the qualification of the process for the European Championship of 2016.
Of course, the secluded team would help if they could handle the US against the US.
The first six months were to be recognized.
Now the results are important.
We must think that we are successful, "Willow agreed.
The only player who has medical problems is the aggressor David Lafata.
The temperature's troubling him.
If he hadn't been able to heal himself against the United States, Coach Willow would have summoned one more assailant.
Genetic disorders are often poorly diagnosed
The woman from Britain describes how, after a bad diagnosis, she thought she was going to die.
After having been diagnosed with another disease, Karin had spent most of her adolescence thinking that she had only a few years of life.
In fact, it was the Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of heritable disorders that hurt nerves out of the brain and spine.
The charity organisation of the UK UK stated that the bad diagnosis is a common problem among people, because the disease knows very little.
It is considered that there are approximately 23 000 people in the UK, which can show symptoms in areas such as muscular weakness, clumsy gait, and twisted toes.
In the case of affected, numbness or pain may occur, this condition is progressive and progressive, which means that the symptoms worsen.
When Thirteen was thirteen, she thought he was suffering from Freidreichovou ataxií (FA) - a disease that has a very bad prognosis.
She believed that before she was celebrating her birthday, she would be on a wheelchair, and she was dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children, now 51, says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the others.
Every day I fell, and it took me longer.
I've never been able to ride with other kids on roller skates, or on a skateboard and in school, because of how I went and running. "
When it was thirteen, and it was after several surgeries to release her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she had taken advantage of her doctor leaving the room, and looked into her file, where she had learned that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was a stalker, and so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home I sought information about the disease in the library and wrote me in the Association of FA," he says.
When they answered me, I was shocked, I panicked.
I thought that before I was eighteen, I would end up on a cart, and before I was twenty-five, I would be dead, and in the meantime I would lose all my abilities.
I was on it all by myself, and I planned for a funeral. "
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk had gone as much as she had expected, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, "Sweetheart, I don't think you have the disease, or you'd be on a cart.
I think it will be something much less dangerous. "
After completing several genetic tests, it was discovered that he had the CMT.
"When he told me what the CMT was, I thought I was a child of fortune," she said.
The charity organisation of the UK has launched a month of information on the CMT to draw attention to this disease.
Entrepreneurs v oblasti Washingtonu: s turnover ekonomika se up tax
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales, and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to the new survey, which was published last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country with the recovery of the economy last year slightly, and firms in Washington were not the exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia together for the fiscal year 2013 to government and local treasuries have done $27,6 billion, which is about 3,8% higher than $26,6 billion in 2012.
Tax burdens - state and local - have risen by 4.3% to $671 billion last year, compared to 3,9% last year, and it was a third growth year after 2009 and 2010 when the tax was reduced.
According to a study carried out by Ernst & Young and the political groupings of Center on State aid, the state taxes increased faster, by 4,3%, by 3,9%.
More than half of the tax revenues of the district, 56%, is from business tax, and 36% of the income of Maryland is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, in proportion to the smallest tax revenues from business.
Researchers argues that the majority of the growth in tax revenues comes from an increase in the value of real estate property belonging to firms, which of the real estate tax this year after three consecutive years, with growth of -1% increased by 3,7%.
Although most of the profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same situation is in Washington.
In D.C., Maryland and Vriginii last year, they paid over $10 billion to state and local taxes, which, compared to 9.6 billion in 2012, represents an annual increase of 4,2%.
However, the apparent increase in the value of the real estate did not increase the state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the tax on real estate represents less than one-fifth of company taxation.
For firms in Virginia and D.C., the tax on real estate is nearly half the state and local taxation.
"In Maryland, the real estate of companies, especially the base of taxes in D.C., government or non-profit organizations that do not pay taxes," Douglas Lindholm explained, CEO of the Center on State.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed only to the real estate market.
According to the data, it appears that revenues from business are also increasing.
Firms in this region have published a tax on corporate income of $2,3 billion, which have increased from 2,1 billion from 2012.
Maryland on corporate tax revenues chose one billion dollars, most in the region.
Although they move in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs does not grow in these three places as quickly.
The rate of growth in D.C. was at the level of the country-wide average, at 4,3%, while the growth of Maryland was significantly higher, 4,9%.
Only in Virginia was an increase in taxation, at 4,1%.
Virginia has three circuits (all of which have the same taxation) the lowest taxation of corporate profits, 6%.
The rate of taxation of commercial companies in Maryland is 8.25%, while the average of D.C. remains relatively high, at 9,975%.
A similar study conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce has shown that Virginia has a lower state and local taxation, and a more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. studies not.
Despite this advantage, Virginia pressure of competition from the south is confronted.
North Carolina recently signed the law lowering tax companies from 6,9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and the next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the State continues to meet the revenue objectives in the coming year, it could be reduced by up to 3% in 2017.
According to the recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better, and that is why the higher state and local taxes apply.
Trade tax on small businesses as a tax on personal income - the structure of offsetting the cost of price increases, which is organised by most firms - in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia increased by 20% to 2.4 billion dollars, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers argues that the trend and the nationwide increase in business tax will probably continue the next year, the total tax revenue from both domestic and local governments, compared to the same period during the first three quarters of 2014, will increase to 6,2%.
However, Washington can lag behind the others because the reduction of state spending is taking its toll on the labour market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorusko and Lafatovy Scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin has called on the negotiations on Novorusku
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in Southeast Ukraine, where government troops with rebel rebels collide from April.
He also warned European companies that, after the current regime of sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The aid that the West provides for the war of Ukrainian armies in the east of Ukraine is contrary to democratic values.
The end of the conflict depends on the Kiev, and thus cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis is over.
Another sanctions for Russia?
Česko si recover right s parts disagree

This has been said by the Permanent President of the Meeting of the Member States Herman Van Rompuy.
According to the Czech Prime Minister, Bohuslav Bohuslav, specific proposals for shifting the form of sanctions should be prepared on Monday.

From December to two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuy will replace it.
At the forefront of European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton will replace the Italian Foreign Minister Federico Mogheriniová.
Italian, which will become a vice-president of the future European Commission, still have to be confirmed by the European Parliament.

How to survive a return from holiday?
We're not going anywhere, and let's sleep.
The last days of vacation are in front of us.
If we get back from the sunny beach or the cottage on the normal course of work, it can be a lot of nuts.
It can even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are good tips about how to deal with the changed situation: rush and enjoy a good sleep.
Joan appointment's family: "We're holding our thumbs. "
Joan Rivers was unconscious for three days, since she had brought her to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter had expressed herself today that she did not lose the hope that she would recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa said, in today's statement.
We're holding her thumbs.
Her mother had been brought into Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call for a rescue service that had resulted in cardiac arrest at yorkwillské endoscopy in the Upper East Side, as the source indicated.
Doctors have deliberately kept her under sedation and under close scrutiny until they are sure of her condition that remains "serious. "
The response was not long to wait, including incredible support on the Internet from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is překrucovaná subtitles
That the media, with its headlines, is not in reality, is (unfortunately) no new.
I know that the headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who did nothing else.
And that's a fact that I've been very worried about lately.
This relates in particular to the Articles on the conflict of Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Indeed, the headlines "Israel attacked Gaza."
Only in the text can you read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the fired rockets from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared truce.
Then the headline "Both sides have violated the truce."
Is the journalistic community aware that this process is directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that all over Europe (and not just there) are growing?
Not even sixty years from the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who survived the Shoah.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the mob shouted slogans "Jewish swine" and the same property,, me.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler did?
Did our journalists have the fact that they were destined for the destruction of the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen, please take some more care of your work.
You are often referred to as "the watchdog of democracy."
Let's get her out of here.
As long as it's here.
And obhajujte also the right of a single democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like us to maintain our government if one of our neighbours has decided that the Czech people will destroy and destroy the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also be aware of another fact.
In the territory of the State of Israel, nearly 20% of Arabs live with Israeli citizenship.
And they're all right.
If you ask them why they don't go between "their" to Gaza, the answers to you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have work, social security, and high health care (I have seen my own eyes, as the Hadassa, which is funded from sponsorship donations from all over the world, often the Arabs and, of course, have been treated).
Hamas also attacks its Arab brothers.
The only real help of Gaza, and this uneasy area, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in headlines.
Information about the practices of Hamas, about its exploitation of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas is intended to eliminate Israel, at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Inform that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organisations.
Inform that, in the nine years of self-government in Gaza, this region could have been flourishing thanks to humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity, for which the Gaza Strip does not apply, and even to the fact that they are being interrupted at this time of time.
If Hamas did not put the money into the construction of underground tunnels, so that they could penetrate Israeli invaders on the territory of Israel, but in the construction of housing homes, hospitals and schools, his Arab brethren in Gaza would be much better.
Amazon buys $1,04 billion for billions of dollars
AMAZON has just confirmed the communication from Monday morning: Internet retailer - producer of videos and hundreds of other things - buys $1,04 billion (970 million American dollars) video streamingovou service.
The announcement caused a surprise, not because it would not expect anyone to buy it, but because it was expected that the buyer would be YouTube.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch Google for one billion was certain, and this link seemed natural.
Twitch, který her only před three lety her Justin.tv, byl primed k tomu, aby se generally used video streamingovou služby - živá verze YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online transmissions from games - in terms of Business Insider "YouTube for live transmitted. "
Interaface Twitch.
Na YouTube jsou již populární videa "Let '," of, kde mudrlanti (mostly older) give games Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube at popisuTwitche is coming up a lot, so reports that YouTube kupujeTwitch, nobody very much appreciated, was a textbook example of how the company would pay the potential competition.
puzzle is why the deal with YouTube did not work, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at present is the expression CEO Twitch Emmet Sheara: "We have chosen the Amazon because they believe in our society, has the same values and a long-term vision, and wants to help us achieve it faster. "
The other mystery is - honestly - the incredible success of the Twitch.
Pro snobs jako jsem, kteří that, že sport better than než monitor, je hard hard, co je tak wonderful na tom, hry place place place jen watch.
One thing is to watch, in three mornings, a friend over his shoulder, as the Resident Evil plays, and the other thing is to observe someone else, how he gets twenty hits in the Call of Duty.
All the games you could look at.
The other problem is that many today, the most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so that you look at their record without being able to check on their own perspective, is quite a good recipe for getting headache.
I admit that the games of the speed of speed, in which the Rogeři of our electronic time will finish the game in record time, is amusing.
But if anyone isn't a master of playing or humor, his channel on Twitch probably won't be very interesting.
But what about the skeptics as I know?
Twitch has a month of 55 million visits and is the fourth at the top of the Internet service.
How exactly does Amazon use it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch stir to Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as if it could have been swallowed by YouTube.
But Twitch has something that wants to attract every company: the hordes of young men they want.
As the director of Twitch Shear, Amazon and Twitch "believe in the future of games, " and the media do not seem to be reluctant, even as.
The second basic lie, creationism.
Another Czech translation of the American ateistického vloggera Arona Ra.
This time on the theme "Holy Scripture are God's word."
Přiloženo the original video.
The second basic lies of creationism is the belief that sacred texts have been drawn up by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that contradict their religion, they often put us in front of the question: Who are you going to believe?
Údajnému word of word, or the word of a man?
As if human examination was entirely trivial compared to the authority they represented their doctrine.
But when they say "human," they talk about science.
And when it comes to "the word of God," we are not talking to the myths of God.
If there really is an intelligent one with some purpose, then it is the one who created a fossil record that exposes the evolutionary history, and it must be the one who invented the genetic formulas that it fits, and it must be the one who added another series of evidence pointing to the final detail in the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
Humans could not create any of the things.
But people can tell stories, fabulovat.
And they were the people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be God's word.
Every supposedly holy teachings of any religion in the world describes itself as being done by people, not by the gods.
People who were "shrank" or "inspired" with their favorite gods, or listening to the dictates of angels, but those texts were not written by any other than mortals with a certain amount of imagination, not angels, and no gods.
If there was indeed one true god, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galaktický rocket, the ultimate entity.
If a creature had ever written a book, there would be only one such book, the only scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels, or alternatives in any language, because mere human writers could not be measured.
And people would not be able to believe it, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and empirical evidence, and would reveal profound morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
Permanently would inspire each reader to the unity of the common faith.
If God had written it, we would expect nothing less.
But what we see instead is the opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all are constantly crumbling into increasingly separate denominations, seeking the truth of the truth, and each in some way the leadership of God's leadership, regardless of continuing divergence and separation in each direction.
Jewish Torah, Christian Gospel, Islamic Koran, Bahá ', Bahá Kitáb-i-Akdás, Zarathuštrovy Avesty, Mahabharátská Adí-Granth, Book Bhagavad-Gita, Book Urantia, or the Book of Urantia are all regarded as "absolute truth" and "revealed the word of a single true god" and the competent believers of each of them say that others are astray.
The only logical explanation is that all of them are astray.
None of the above books has any advantage over the other.
None of them have the burden of proof, and there can be no historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I am a professor of ancient history at the Westland University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historic.
Of course it isn't.
You still have faith.
All of them require faith, and also apologia (defence), because they contain inconsistencies, absurdity, and primitive notions once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it can't be said that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them are pushing for evil atrocities instead of morality, and many of them claim that they have been confirmed by the fulfillment of the prophecy - that any of them may contain the prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
The Front theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written in their hands, and therefore they are the subject of interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive, and often the prejudices of their politically motivated authors, thereby explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a call, more of a sort of comment.
We have to point out that we have two different authors, whose work has somehow been mixed together during some revisions.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author, and it certainly isn't the story of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources for Pentateuch, i.e. five Books "chapter" and Moses refunded authorship, because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
The experts agree on the fact that Genesis has been lodged (probably Ezdrášem) from a few each oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
The other documents were in the same time, and all of them were attributed to human authors.
The Bible isn't even as old as her believer thinks.
The Scrolls from the Dead Sea are oldest archeological of texts known for their unfinished basis for all Western monotheistic faiths, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of zoroastriánství, Buddhism, Hinduism, helénismu, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religions.
Christianity began as a gnostická of faith, followed by docéti and ebionité, and their completely different insights on Jesus, which, at the end of the compromise, was in some sort of compromise called orthodoxy.
The other Christian groups, like luciferiáni, were off and discredited other revisions Bibles.
One of these your relates to King Ugaritu, who was in charge of 3500 years ago.
Because his followers represented a major threat to young religious religions, the authors of the New Testament have decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebula, "the Lord on the Mountain" changed to Beelzebub "Lord of the Flies."
So the Bibles had been deliberately and fraudulently from both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Testament was published in the 4th century A.D. in a series of komisních decisions in the named.
The four gospel were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by the simple hand of a hand, as if the fact was to accept or reject the vote.
The way in which the canon evolved depended on what had been done on Sundays at the time of the Christian centers.
Co se read na neděli neděli po Easter v Jeruzalemské církve?
What about Roman church in the same time?
And they were gradually discovering that they were coming to the same stories.
And so the core of the canon had evolved from the wisdom of the primal church.
So the council simply accepted as the gospel of any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses in that time.
But in the same way, they had taken more than ten books from the Bible, though the books that had been approved.
We will find the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God's word refer to books that are just words of people and / or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often refers to human writers.
But how could she have been so approved if the god had been the real author of this random of legend, the parable, and the žalmové?
The Bible was certainly written by humans, and certainly not very osvíceními, on the contrary!
That is why the great part of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whatever it is about almost anything from the start to the end.
We are talking about people who believe that snakes and donkeys can talk, believe in spells, bloody sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology, and five elements of magic.
They thought that if they had to use the magic rod they'd cut in blood, they would cure it from the leprosy.
We are talking about people who thought that rabbits are ruminants and bats are birds and whales are fish, and pi is the whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow, they would give birth to their calves.
How could anyone say anything about genetics?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know that.
If the Bible had been written up to a higher being, then it would not contain such a mistake as it contains.
If it had come from the pens, and it was intended as a history of history, then it wouldn't contain any of what it contains.
As a moral guide, because most of the original Hebrew files were drawn up by uneducated and bigoted savages who ignored or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of children, violence against children, abortions, looting, looting, genocide, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
In order to defend their inhumanity claims that they will act in God's will.
But the Creationists still ignore this.
Some of their websites admit that if any reality is in conflict with Bibles, then the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if they hadn't had their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, one and the other are the same.
It is ironic that they reject God's "work" as "the worship of creation instead of the creator."
But they regard themselves as the word of God and God Himself, and even insist that the rebuttal of their supposedly "holy" books somehow the God as such.
Not their version of God but every version of God.
Kreacionističtí Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist, and the Bible might be wrong, because they can't separate the doctrine from the deity.
So this is the kind of idolatry, where believers worship a human being produced, as if these books were the God itself, because they think they are.
But the god had never written or secretary none of the writings of any religion.
All that people approved or rejected in their supposedly "invariable words" were vymýšleno, or, grouped, transhipped, interpreted, titrated, and often purposely result and překrucováno.

The duration of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
The leakage of naked images of the celebrities can be viewed as a reminder of the safe use of online services.

Mud, the same muck.
And then they found the guns at the end of the war,
This well is from the church of St. George.
We cut the growth around, and we started pulling out the ancient of about a meter and a half of mud and rotting leaves.
As we neared the bottom of the day, we ran into the barrel, "said Novak.
We pulled it out, cleaned up, and discovered that it was the skeleton of an attack German rifle that was used by the SS troops.
The verdict is supposedly unusual.
According to my information, such guns were produced at the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand, "said Novak.
All of the woodwork had decomposed over time, so it was useless.
But her body is preserved - it holds its shape.
How did it get in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe there were people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS troops, probably out of fear.
On the run, they wouldn't have done it.
Those their weapons in the woods, "think thought.
The rifle was the only thing that the enthusiasts of the Rainbow Mountains had found in the well.
"There might have been a hand grenades, there were a lot of them all around, so we slowed down to work, and we had to dig up the mud so that there was no accident, but there was nothing else down there," said Novak.
The findings will end in the depository of the museum on the castle in the nearby Javorový Rudolticích.
Ukraine General: Zajatého Čech jsem yet neosvobozoval
Exclusive conversation Aktuálně.cz. s generálplukovníkem Volodymyrem Rubanem, který exempts Ukrainian soldiers ze captive pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev / Prague - "I'm sorry, I have to take this... call me out of the Donetsk," he apologized for eight times in an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz. Ukrainian Volodymyr Ruban, or the director of the Center Center.
The Volodymyr Ruban v television debate.
In any such interruption, it was impossible to hear the names of the people, their numbers or places, where they were - or should be - which the Ruban had specified their counterpart on the other end of the phone.
"That will be it - go there," he concluded one of the lightning discussions with the Doněckem, and returned to our own.
Volodymyr Ruban je General v reserve, former pilot fighters a active party protests protests na Majdanu.
Even yesterday - when we talked to a conversation - he was in Donetsk.
liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of the Chechen separatists are devoted to twenty-four hours a day.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that the Czechs are fighting on the side of the Chechen separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to thirty.
But there can be much more.
Have you met a Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: Osvobozoval jsem captured Serbs, Dagestánce, Chechnya, one Swede, Georgians... ale Čecha ještě ne.
But I know who to turn in Prague, if we came upon your captive countryman and could rescue him.
Ukrainian soldier captive separatists
What do you advise the Czechs who add to the pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian soldiers are captured?
They should understand that, as the Czechs are fighting in Ukrainian volunteer volunteers and the separatists are captured, they will shoot them without mercy, as well as any other foreigner.
Separatists consider these men for the rent of mercenaries, and they do not deserve anything but death.
But if, for example, the Ukrainian soldiers captured a group of separatist separatists - and, among them, even Čecha, they will sit behind bars and negotiate with him as a prisoner of war.
The man will survive.
The Ukrainian side behaves at war as a state.
And how much did you manage to save the Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand it, in exchange.
Some sources indicate that a hundred men have long since passed.
We have already stopped counting on how many people have helped.
But we just liberated them... before the war, if they decide to continue.
The are doctors at war, surgeons, but we certainly don't.
That's it.
And each day grows more and more.
We'll save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And it may not always be a replacement.
Sometimes it is enough for the release of prisoners, as well as a human plea.
It is rumored that you have acquired a great authority over a few months, and even trust... as in the Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both warring parties?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "crazy general with steel balls."
Don't embarrass me.
And perhaps it reflects the nature of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Důstojnického corps, I had acquired some authority before.
Never nechytračím, I, and I always keep a word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and I'm telling the truth.
Even if it is the Ukrainian government, or the Donets or the Donets.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply say they torture them and kill them.
And they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even in the exchange of prisoners...........................................................
How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know?
... (long pause)... for the torture of prisoners, both Ukrainians and the separatists are used to torture.
Unfortunately.
And executions?
It's only on the Donets side.
I have no information about the Ukrainian army, as well as the Ukrainian army.
There was no indication that the Ukrainian army had done something like that.
We have an idea about the number of executions, but I can't state the figures and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe mi characters a motives pro-Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans of Afghanistan.
They seek autonomy, and perhaps even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk, at least they say so.
They don't want to play games with the Ukrainian oligarchs.
The Separatists have full teeth in the oligarchs, and they are their sworn opponents - for life and death.
As we say, we'll cut them down to the throat.
The same dreams and desires, by the way, were shown on the Majdanu.
And now a little zaspekuluji: Russia supports separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be large and the other, on the other hand, for a small one.
But this is my phrase, but there is an implacable contradiction in it.
What, for example, is one of the most prominent leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Igor?
Every time I cross the line of war, I am unarmed, and I am showing the soldiers or the has, naked hands.
And I always have both sides of those two hundred and three hundred meters in the sights or in the optical sights.
Those faces of the people who are pointing at me every time I see... and they can squeeze the trigger of their weapons at any time.
The, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just as little of in the great Russian Empire.
In any case, it continues to talk about it, and Ukraine considers it a kind of misunderstanding.
Such a state would not even exist.
At the same time, the enemy is the enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we talk about characters in the news show of Ukrainian television, your prime minister, you Jaceňuka, called a weak, Clayton, and tired "leader," who would have done best if he had gone quickly.
In the three hundred yards of walking, I will always get at least five times.
Why should I hide with the view that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that it is detrimental to our country?
Do you have a share of the war in Ukraine?
Perhaps you know that Ukrainians Jaceňuka the dubbed "rabbit."
And the rabbit is not in the eyes of the Ukrainians, from whom the fear would be, or should be, for the other respect and authority.
His behavior is directly copying the behaviour of a rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister, he does not have the right to weep in parliament, begging him, to play with him, threaten to impose a function... he must drive the country, manage it, and protect it at the time of war.
As a threat to the country, the prime minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest on emotional emotions.
He was the first of Ukraine's ministers.
And Yatsenyuk?
He acts like a teenage girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he has never been strong... not fighting for Ukraine, he's always complaining about everything.
He should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the galaxy had not been able to save the profits

The results that take account of the views of both viewers and film critics suggest that this year's film crop is similar to that of last year.
According to some commentators, a change in the attitude of viewers and the higher popularity of Internet sites such as Netflix can be blamed.
The director Jon Favreau, currently working on the Disney processing of the Book of Jungle, the Web page of Hollywood Reporter said, "I think the times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what it has been.

Last summer, he criticized the director Steven Spielberg's study for relying too much on the right to cartoons, and predicted the "collapse " of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that there may be something about its catastrophic prophecy.

The producer of X-Men Simon Kinberg recently identified a decline in sales as simply "cyclical ." For Hollywood Reporter said," The next summer will be the summer's biggest box-office in history, and no one will worry about selling. "

The Film Festival is otherwise experiencing a crisis
Po huge enthusiasm nad initiating filmu Birdman, který režisér Alejandro González González se suddenly into mezi serious candidates na Golden lion, další days suggest impression, že zájem o 71 ročník festivalu v Venice somewhat faded.
However, because the number of seats in the largest chamber has risen to fourteen hundred, or because critics have followed criticism, but for viewers less attractive images as a document on genocide in Indonesia's 60th years of expression, and other films from America's 99 homes to Iranian Stories, they simply remained empty seats.
Heroes of comics
Even the red carpet in front of the palace's palace had not yet been such crowds as in the past, and supposedly ceased to be a problem at the last minute of the hotel.
The crisis has spoken in Italy more than elsewhere, and it is not surprising that it has also affected the esteemed institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not show a lack of personality, but only in the context of films.
While the younger fans yearned for the autogramech of leaders superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had successfully completed dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations without the difference, it became the main event of visiting the legendary actor Al Qaeda.
There are two movies in the first place.

Points for Italy

The black souls directed by Francesco Munzi became a long ovation standing after the first slide of the underscored.
Kalábrijská of of je v him viewed na rodinné relations mezi clans, které each fighting o much a money, a director could reconcile všechny conditions pro kvalitní filmu: kvalitní screenplay, kameru, hudbu a herce.
He also took hold of the chamber's psychothriller heart, which made the Saverio Costanzo with the Albou Rohrwacherovou in the role of a woman who almost killed his own child.
On the contrary, from the French competition films, the warm welcome was not celebrated for fame, or three hearts, both works clinging on the traditional model of table films that are based on the popularity of the representatives of the leaders.
But after all, two truly excellent films, the Birdman and the Black souls, are not so few on the first half of the festival.
And even though the festival shows most depressing ideas, a new snapshot of Peter Bogdanoviche with the name 's Funny That Way, humorous comedy in Venice, outside the competition and produced in the style of American veseloher, was able to raise the mood for more than one day.

In addition, the Czech Republic has few widely educated people and statistics show that they have good applications.
The beginning of the school year is here.
In the schools of the past fourteen days, there were great preparations.

"French Socialists should shut up and put France in order," says Francoise Holland.
Valls calls on a highly fragmented left to "show its support " to the President president, whose new division of functions did not meet with the consent of the majority of the French.
The President deserves a general respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.

"And the new will not last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen said to his supporters.
Again, she repeated the challenge of her party to dissolve Parliament and said that it was convinced that the party could win early elections and that it was prepared to drive the country.
The French ruling party has suffered defeat in the March, and in May the extremely conservative right has succeeded in elections to the European Parliament.
According to the opinion of the public opinion of the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of the French think that the Socialist Party exposes the risk of being divided into several competing factions before the end of the six-month term of office in 2017.

Last week, he put the victory of the proponentům Scottish independence in the grasp of his hand.
The campaign for Scotch independence was in danger of making such a mistake when it almost placed on billboards across Scotland asking whether the Scots wanted to be rich.
But you will not get to the hearts of the Scottish electorate that you will appeal to their purse, or you will not gain their respect when you threaten them.
The morale of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church.
The Scots have a much greater tendency to banish the money from the temple than to dictate from them to vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and therefore, in the television debate, he has repeatedly questioned his rival, Unioner Darling, whether he is willing to respect the 'sovereign will of the Scottish people' if the electorate voted for independence, and start to promote a single currency for Scotland and for England.
The Darling forced him to choose between the Scottish civil society and the London financiers, and he fell into this trap with a grimace.
Of course, we will not support the mandate of the Scottish electorate.
However, the debate on which Scotland's currency would have been more or less neutralised.
What really motivates the Scottish electorate is Fairness, job opportunities and the defence of state health that citizens have free.
Darling, in the currency of the currency, supported the London banker, and caused the impression that it would not protest against the privatisation of health.
By the way he said it, "he went into bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for everyone in Scotland.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland not to voters, but to the association of "bosses," to the Confederacy of the British industry.
It is becoming clear that Ahmadinejad's refusal to discuss independence with the Scottish Prime Minister serious was a serious mistake for the Goldstone campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee.
The Scots would respect him if he had come to a debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron could say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country."
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain.
What they say is clear: the Scots have no idea and they must accept what it is.

The end of the vacation was the best, the last week that we were not going anywhere, and only with the lounging and fluttered of the summer, the silence before the storm, the stillness before the stress.

There are ruffians, to avoid them, as interesting as they hold together, and how soon they are.
And these mature girls who had come to asphodels are laughing now, perhaps, in their lives over the holidays, something changed while I was in the old.
And new gawky, some of the jitters and other excited, why are they coming up here?
Because he has to, educate the war.
In this way, the cold dampness of the floor and the light smell of disinfectant, the poisoned janitor with the mop, I'm afraid the same thing that says the pupil key from the tin box, where the textbooks can be left, and which is still so little.

Without a stranger's help, she had been born a little girl she had wrapped in a ready blanket, tucked under her jacket, and carried her to the road Feeder, where she had put her down to the bushes at some tens of meters from the road.
delivered on the way to school
It came to me a little sooner.
I was on my way to school.
I had the need to go to the bathroom on the bus, and I gave birth.

I cut the cord with the scissors I wore to school, "said defendant, and said she was ashamed of her pregnancy.

A similar scenario repeated the next year in the spring.
The woman from February to 12 April, when the unborn child was found by random witnesses under the pond at the pond, she had given birth to her.
This time in the bathroom, the attic apartment in the family house.
Without checking that he had been born alive without the cut and tongue-tied umbilical, who had been wrapped around his neck, she put a child into several plastic packages, including plastic bags, and left him in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his partner had taken him to the pond.
In the end, he gave her a friend
The father of both children was a friend of the defendants, who did not know about the pregnancies.
Even for that reason, he does not now stand trial in court; he has only been punished for a breach of the Law on funeral.
It was him who turned back to the police.
I don't like being punished as a accomplice.
He fiddled with the child against my wishes.
I know that my solution was not right, but it came to me at this moment as human, "he said, concealing the indignation of the defendant, which was supposed to be in the relationship of the man, and was afraid of him.
In the course of his testimony, the young woman spoke quite serenely.
The tears in her eyes gave her a moment when she spoke of a relationship to her parents, from whom she had gone after the age of majority.
She didn't want to kill
"He drives me every 14 days for a visit, doing everything for me, though I know I don't deserve it," she sobbed.
I didn't flatter myself because I didn't want the kids, I thought I was young.
I still wanted him to go to thanks, but I don't know what happened that I didn't.
I can't explain that to you, "answered the judge.
She refused, however, that she would have acted deliberately and intended to kill the newborn.
In addition, the second child was born dead.
Even in pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I did not deny it.
And he didn't drink hard.
Even smoking was limited, "she said.
Although pregnancy was seen in both cases, all and repeated questions claimed that he had a health problem.
And my friend.

Pan-democrat activists in Hong Kong day after the vote on the vote by the Chinese authorities
Nearby, there was a group of people loyal to Beijing who waved a Chinese flag.
The Permanent Commission of the National People's Congress, on Sunday, agreed that only two of the three candidates participated in the election in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the support of a commission commission, which is likely to be composed of members of the faithful Beijing.
For this decision, it is almost impossible for the opposition democrats to be able to get to the ballot, and to bring pro-demokratické activists to renew the pledge and to cripple the financial center of Hong Kong's protest of the "occupation of occupation. "
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tensions, China's leaders fear that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing, in June, published a detailed report by the Chinese authorities in Hong Kong, democratic activists organised an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official circuit, and hundreds of thousands of people entering the city's business district and held it.
The press conference for Prime Minister Li will be organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, on a number of press conferences, the Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Zhang and the Deputy Director of the State Board of the Bureau of Hong Kong and Macao Feng Wei.
Student activists have said that this afternoon will be brought before the government of Hong Kong.
In the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin calls for Kiev to start negotiations on "state sovereignty " with eastern Ukraine.
According to the description of the events of the Russian newspaper, Russia's President Vladimir Putin asked for the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east, and immediately initiated negotiations on "state sovereignty " of breakaway areas.
His spokesperson, Dmitriy Peskov later, explained that Putin had no intention of suggesting that the Eastern Ukraine region under control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be encouraged to have the power to protect its rights and interests in Russian speaking.
Putin's call for the government to deal with the rebel rebels as equals, responds to the obvious strategy that follows from the outbreak of the riots five months ago: help separatists to occupy the territory and the Ukrainian Government of Ukraine to grant a new issued de facto independence in order to join the West with Russia.
In the interview for the first channel of state television, Putin has condemned the Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which, in March and April, dominate the separatists after Moscow on 18 March of the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently dubbed the territory as "Novorusko " or" New Russia ," a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian empire.
Russia's press agency has published Putin's words, according to which there is a "prisoner of illusions, " anyone who believes that there are peace negotiations on the horizon, because Ukrainian politicians have launched themselves before parliamentary elections on 26 October, while government troops attack civilian populations in areas of controlled separatists.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also about the political organization of society and the status of the state sovereignty of the south-east Ukraine," he said.
Peskov has said that Putin's reference to state sovereignty has been strengthened in the context of broader autonomy, which, with the leadership of Kyiv, has been acting for several months, and which is intended to mitigate the fears of Russian speakers in the threat of cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov has stated that only the Ukrainian Government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the internal Ukrainian conflict. "
The Kremlin spokesman for the Kremlin to correct the "erroneous interpretation " has highlighted Russia's leadership to address the insurgency of the separatists in the East, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the population's population are indigenous to ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much greater difficulties in annex and Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people are not the Russians, and the opinion polls that have taken place before the conflict have shown broad support to remain in Ukraine.
autonomy, which Russian diplomats acted in international fora, would enable regional governments in Ukraine to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and, in essence, give the Kremlin a de facto control over the territory that would unite the Russian mainland.
The Black peninsula of annexed, five months ago, is the headquarters of the main Russian naval fleet, the maritime business background, as well as the historic coastal districts.
The areas between the Russian proves and the Crimean are also the Centre, the factories and the foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukraine's President Petra Porošenko, during his speech from 7 June, suggested that Ukrainian lawmakers - after the new elections - consider changes in the constitution, which would give more control over their finances and linguistic status.
But this vision of autonomy differs considerably from the vision of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is driven from armaments and inciting violence.
Putin's last call for Kiev to deal with separatists as equals, following the next steps of the insurgents last week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously quiet area along the Caspian Sea have invaded the eastern Ukraine.
The separatists have taken control of the Russians with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a crusade in order to occupy the strategic coastal area to the Crimea.
This precipitated the huge civilian and military effort of to Mariupol, the port of by combinates of 500 000 inhabitants, which lies between the Novoazovskem and the narrow entrance gates to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Porošenko stepped out on the European Union's leading leaders in Brussels and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which is independent of the last 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," the Porošenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any definitive steps - leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, Speaker of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council on Saturday reporters in Kiev said that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsku after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1 000 military troops had penetrated the Doněcké area to support separatist separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who had been captured in the Russian invasion of the Russian invasion were, on Sunday, in 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the outback of Ukraine, on Sunday Lysenko.

Olomouc - Gods a thunderbolts, které co-owner Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr cast na své child last week, jsou, are, seems.
In the end, however, it was only a point at the end of the Opava.
Thanks and ferocity si club boss jen a udobřili.
The money on the payroll would soon be able to come to the club.
"I'm going to have another fight, as I talked about it last week, but I am far more optimistic," said Lébr, that despite the fact that Sigma did not win, the players had persuaded him.
kel-fierceness and the deployment we played mainly in the second halftime was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In such a case, I am able to forgive that he will not win.
If we played that from the beginning of the season, I'm sure we're still lost, "he thinks.
Sigma v v has initial pressure domestic, pak game to a ve druhém halfway už bylo better.
Po victory Kalvodovi charges charges, ale své options' k goal, a tak win could.
The result is not according to our ideas.
To complete satisfaction, we lacked only one change of chance, "said Lébr, but he did not think that the change in the approach of the footballers caused only his threat.
There were more aspects.
From my side, from the coach, or the fans, "said Lébr.
With pressure, Sigma must count
Players se po game v v event z last týdne much much much.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried to imperviousness it, "said the young Keeper, Michael Strogoff.

We'll still be under pressure.
They all want to get out of us.
Today we have shown that if we fight and run all the asses, it will go, "he said.
The warnings have been taken to heart
Not even the coach, Leoš shied, that preparation for the game was not the easiest, in view of the atmosphere that had existed in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized that, and today it was evident that the warnings of Mr. Lébra had taken it to the heart.
Even though it wasn't that they didn't want to fight and do it, "said the trainer.
It was like the first fifteen minutes.
It was before we reached the hardness and realized what the other League was.
It's not just about fotbalovosti, but mostly about the militancy, "said Kalvoda.
We can only hope that in the next game the Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I'd love to believe it," he added.
