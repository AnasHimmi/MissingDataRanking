, is Peter possible that during still remain few hours, you will change a uniform?
I with this do not expect, but in football there is never nothing percent.
Perhaps during a day, an offer that will not go to refuse will come.
How would such offer have to look?
" I do not know it yet so well, how such offer what is not to refuse it, he looks actually laughs).
Would have to occur to consensus of all sides if mainly it would depend on a position, Chelsea, any offer, a club would solve or not.
Is even technically feasible to do such transfer that you are now in Prague?
Would not a need be somewhere in new působiště to sign any new contract?
So I did not consider it.
But a lot of players all is somewhere on reprezentační reunions and certainly today the lot of the transfers will close still is in such situation now.
Somehow viable, it would be certainly.
What is on the planet of clubs which would be able to afford you?
Well I do not know it really then.
And you therefore do not you push departure.
The situation when I did not catch in the first three matches of a new season is for me after fifteen years of a career new.

I of this struggle for a position want to participate continue of brankář Chelsea and is on a coach who he will choose what decisions during following weeks he will make.
What role in your decision does a family play?
Into an account, I take all factors.
Essential a sport view is for me obviously, but I look it and from a personal site to which need of the family they belong of course.
Is possible you would catch also for an other club in England?
This the question of which I thought of me, he will affect never is.
But all is in football possible.
I want to rule out nothing.

Restoration of a very American ideal labour rights human rights are also.
Kongresmeni Keith Ellison and, John Lewis proposed a law that in unions has to protect an organization as the civil law.
„ unions work how according to it, job places work for a middle class “, says Ellison, democratic Senator for the Minnesota which is of spolupředsedající Congressional Committee.
Therefore I'm so proud that with by a model of occasional rights John Lewis, I can present the law strengthen status of employees.
This breakthrough legislation workers will give the same legal opportunity how to defend discrimination in the organisation in unions as other forms of discrimination -, and he will stop protiodborový forces.
To adjust Act, Labour relationships, so to allow all employees who face discrimination, to join in unions, to sue in a civil court -, and to vysoudit compensation or reparation of damages -, a correct and necessary initiative is.
Certainly it the radical initiative - is not but according to at least not American standards.
In the best way, how to understand, present what in a law Ellison, Lewis and other claimants he is again to bind to an American ideal.
, And despite union fights that held in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once supported countries on an all world to accept to extend and to respect labour rights.
Times, and millions of Americans still remember them when a country promoted one breath democracy freedom of a word, freedom of press and the right to an assembly were.
The United States after Second World War occupied Japan and General Douglas MacArthur, its advisors supported the country to accept Constitution design so to ensure military autokracie Hideki Toja will be replaced by democracy.
Was convince employees and their unions play the role in a formation of new Japan they included in them a language, and openly they recognised the „ right of employees to collect collectively to negotiate and to act them being guaranteed “.
The United States after Second World War occupied Germany General Dwight David Eisenhower and its advisors, they encouraged Germans to create the Constitution which will ensure fascism, Adolf Hitler, will be replaced by strong democracy.
Germans realized that employees in a new nation will need, to organise and to promote, and therefore they included the clause which openly says: the „ right to create societies which will secure, and will improve work and economic conditions and an each individual, an each profession or to the profession will be guaranteed.
The arrangement which that right they will restrict or will seek its damage, will be canceled. Measures lead to fulfil such purpose are not legal.
When the former first Lady, Eleanors Roosevelt, chaired to International Commission for human Rights that proposed Universal Declaration of human rights that in a year 1948 were adopted by United Nations as a global contract, included in it a guarantee plaintiffs and Roosevelt that „ everyone has the right in protection of its interests, to create unions and to enter them “.
Americans of an entire generation accepted basic premisa that labour rights are human rights.
A country advised the other countries how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans explained it must be protected the right to create work unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and the government agencies in a position of an equal partner -.
Now he is these rights in America are attacked, to return to an American ideal that work people must have the right in the free and open society to organise and to enforce certainly necessary.
Ago how fifty years said Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.
A history a large teacher is.
Now everyone knows unions of a strength of a nation did not reduce, but they expanded it.
They increased a living standard of millions of people, they created a market, an industry and a production they raised to a not tušený level.
Those who unions attack, these simple truths forget, histories, but remember them.
A history does not forget, and we also would not have.
Such formal recognition of labour rights human - add-on of protection of civil rights so, he is great overdue - to protect the discrimination in an organisation of unions.
Keith Ellison and, John Lewis restore ideals that, lifted America, and made from it a real promise of democracy.

A Henry own mother had diabetes.
It was one of things that killed it.
I was more, more large overweight, and they began to show symptoms of diabetes a doctor said me you must make a radical change „: “.
I started to go to a large fitness centre, and too I had to keep a drastic diet to eliminate of symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And tedious.
No one wants to eat same carrot.
The change in a direction ubírání, Henry of a career, maybe reflects in its elegant, short-cropped close-cropped beard.
Then after it giving recognition from a criticism for its Othello he immersed into a theatre.
Comedy full of errors and fences Augustus Wilson followed.
An other experience than sitcoms and comedies that filled its hektický work life, it is.
He started it was 16, and he worked in a factory.
DJ seen it on a stage, how parodovats someone, and wrote on it to a talentový competition New Faces.
Its television career began in mid, 70. years,: „ I was only black imitátor / long the comedian in television “.
He learned under march.
It that me had to notice public too, I had to learn between years 1975 and 1985 how to make up work jokes, to be a star and to appear in tv and it was really hard.
The Lenny in New Faces in a year 1975.
It its manager owned rights to a jevištní production to the in which and The Black White minstrel show, entertainment program actors převlékated for blacks Henry in it appeared the five years finally by his comedy.
My family for it was already comfortable.
Little I wish never to happen, but I do not regret of it.
And it a special and embarrassing position was, I worked on large stages, and he learned how to work with a crowd.
It was what a by and by „ years oceňovaný main product of british television “, but „ grotesque parody of blacks was also “.
In 80. years, Henry worked in alternative komediální circle, and introduced the characters which also zesměšňovated, and they celebrated a british black culture.
The first series, The Lenny Henry show, began to broadcast in a year 1984, and in the 90. years, he was outside other know as the chef Gareth Blacklock in komediální series a boss.
Advertisings took a further decade it, documents, tv series and, roles in movies but after odvysílání of its series the LennyHenry.tv, BBC in the year 2008, said: what you will be doing now, Lene so „ little it looks namely it stuck in one place or slightly you miss from a way. “.
Next on a line, was a documentary programme, Radio 4, call What's SO Great About? what is... / so of great...
First Shakespeare was.
Shakespeare I had severely allergy.
In a school, we did not learn it really, and I thought something it is for a white middle class.
Of it, I had a fear.
All Adrian Lester said with who we did an interview in a show, Peter Hall Trevor Nunn, Judi Dench: you would have to try it „ “.
They will not navážet to it you do not know you talk what.
Trying few of words, and you will see why we have all Shakespeare so like.
Henry for a document made twenty lines from Othello's final speech, and already he went in this.
It I gave a feeling I will prove it.
As if me it gave courage.
„ this it is. A serious matter, it , it is seriously, learn a text something on this find out.
Testing was hard, and previously I read this game months and months.
And a success it was.
It looked to wait the trouble which did not happen.
Soon he began to play in comedy of full errors.
Suddenly I was in National Theatre. I could not believe it.
Into one moment, I thought „, he changed: “.
Occurred to technical malfunction, and Henry instinctively felt that he must take a responsibility for seizure of an audience.
„ the voice in a head said me before ‚ he will fix a computer, ten minutes are: you need now entertaining ‘“.
This a theatrical director announced that a show will continue a problem will solve.
I left a stage, and something in me said: „ Hm God “.
My responsibility, it is not.
For me, someone other can solve this.
„ you play so stay in a role “.
The Henry in the fences in Duchess Theatre.
Learning a text of the fences, a challenge was.
Panic is quite good, he supplies determination.
A game also as the God sign which says: you would have to do this „ “it was accepted well.
Of course, it says in a resonant voice.
In this, I stay.
I have it a fact like.
I'm glad in testing.
Henry nevertheless a brain of komediant our conversation interrupts an all time by humorný performances when, he enters, and he gets from a role of imitátor remains -.
I decided to do not do stand-upy to have satisfaction from a room of full foreigners he is little dangerous I would say.
If still something you look, you can get into an impasse end.
Sometimes I do I want, Live atmosphere The Apollo, but longer it does not enjoy me sooner.
I asked if again ever will organise stand-up tour.
- I do not think happy of it to sit in one room with the director which helps to give outlines of a beginning, of means and to the end of a journey ever I would want to give up this.
Your new inkarnace?
I think so.
Herectví likes me.
Fun it is.
Still you tell the stories which are great.
I love the stories.
People love the stories.

In Ron Fairheadový found a boss BBC perhaps for hard times.
He carries clouds of glory from a world of banking, MEDIA management and internal Conclave a conservative party.
It he has experiences from front lines.
Began a career in a konzultantský company Bain and Company, přes Morgan Stanley, continued then, Bombadier, ICI, and into the media world, Pearsons.
She was seven years an Executive director Financial Times. On a function, she resigned her younger colleague occupied the highest function in the parent company., Pearson's

In May, I described work of Director, way chalice with poison.
Only an extensive and intricate entity is BBC in a centre, public life, but in its structure internal paradox exists also.
A corporation turns two directions: inside to the top layer of hierarchy of own leadership, BBC, but also to an out voice of public in days of rest things do not work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly who requires a thorough reform.
Which director but would risk that he will come to a company complex as Chinese dynasty they will spread it, and it they will deprive it work.
A heavy challenge, it is.
If it so difficult was not, it would see like many of people, how diminishes BBC - its power, its finances -, and its status revises how.
With it how expand a range of a competition and a new technology he questions old certainties, he carries immediate negotiations on koncesionářský fees for BBC a great danger.
For a modest amount 145.50 of a pound annually, british public buys share in something what the largest media company in a world is certainly.
BBC tells a good story: he claims its production reaches 96 % of households, and so only 40 pences cost each daily.
Moreover popularity, BBC, rises obviously: 53 % of supporters to 31 % ago ten years.
Models of a use of services, BBC, changed: today me, newspaper headlines show on mobile phone and to the programmes which I missed I can look at iPlayera.
But remains a very beloved and wonderful institution and continue BBC.
He needs an amazing director - I hope of one, she found.

An extraordinary example from a vychvalovaný new novel, Howard Jacobson on love and a letter, „ J “.
They dissolved it this best way is how to describe it, gradually, as the cardboard box which someone left on rain spread.
Of an only time from the time a woman told it is too serious, complex, rapid, isolated, and perhaps little irritable.
And then she shook it a hand.
Irritably he admitted it.
Was able to fuck yes as hedgehog.
The last victim of this its ability incipient love pletka that more usually promised it he will relieve from lonely life boredom and perhaps he will provide it any satisfaction and was.
Ailinn Solomonsová fragile beauty with wild mane of hairs and a přelétavý heart from the village on a North island that was even remoter and not more hospitable than PORT, Reuben, was.
With the for which to south she came older companion Kevern considered her aunt that inherited the property in a wet but beautiful valley call příhodně the, tomato valley is.
In a house several years, no one lived.
Pipes seeped, dead spiders were in tubs, if slugs oslizle signed to windows, as, they thought that they it place owns a garden was overgrown, and a weed resembled huge hlávka of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage from child stories, horrible and also charming by the garden full of a secret.
A profile of an author: Howard Jacobson, Booker, Prize 2014, is whose novel „, J “, on a preliminary list of nominations, Man.
A narrower choice will be notified a next week.
Kevern with Ailinn sat on the rozkládací chairs in long grass, and held hands, enjoyed of a not expectedly warm spring afternoon, they tuned a public station absently that supplied a county by útěšný music and reassuring reports when in this it, a sight to its sunburned cross-legged legs reminded an old song the long forget black comic of which its father listened cloudy shades like.
You have too large feet.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they did not play already such songs in radios.
They were not forbid - actually forbid nothing just they did not play was -.
They helped them to get to desuetudo as an it word desuetudo.
A People taste did it what never would do regulations and a position outside a law and as people they choose the memoáries, he concerns what of books in which poor becomes rich, cooks and love novels so ballads choose in music.
Kavern allowed strhnouting se by a day, and he began to play imaginary piano and by a gross, comical voice he sang serenáda to Aillininý large feet.
Ailinn did not understand.
„ it a popular song from jazz pianista to Fatsa of Waller “and automatically he put two fingers to lips was, he said.
Always its father did this he wanted to suppress a letter, J, before it he will come out from mouths.
It began as a game when he was still small.
The father told it he played the game and with his father.
When you are in a word what began on J, they did not give before a mouth two fingers, it cost you penny.
Longer it was not then very funny and funny it was not or now.
Only he knew it from it expects, it was all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn never heard any.
Nor jazz and directly he was not built outside a law did not play.
Improvisation went from fashion.
In a life, place only for one „ was “.
When she started to play melodies, they wanted to know people, he will end exactly where.
It same in humor.
Its not předvidatelnost people went to nerves.
And jazz humor express by a song was.
Although and of ten years, he did not hear Sammy to Davis Junior, Kevern jazz from a father's polotajný collection, old CDs, knew.
At least Aillin, he had not to say but that of Fatsa Waller was a black.
Of her age, she could not remember a time when favorite singers the blacks were not.
Without also laws or coercion.
A povolný company such is, in which each its part with gratitude - with gratitude those who they were a happy accident of ušetření - agrees with a principle of group gratitude.
, People of an afro-karibský origin by temperament and konstituce suited for bavení and athletics and so they sang, and they ran.
People by the origin from Indian subkontinent by nature talent for electronics took responsibility for it that no family will be without functional phone.
Pole what remained, Greeks they remained what washed a dish, plumbers were.
Those of the States of Persian Gulf and Levant, whose grandparents quickly did not leave a country while happened this what happened if this happened - they feared they would accuse them that they added into a fire actually they feared next they will spend this fire them, - they opened restaurants sold where labneh, and they smoked water pipes they did not draw, and a not action slowly consumed them.
Each according to its talent.
Of it she listened only ballads, Ailinn understood hardly, how, Kavern would sing which just to her from four-letter words, music could arise.
Music was an expression of love.
„ they are not in a fact mean “, said Kevern.
Maybe just for people, they have what too big feet.
My father never offended anyone, but he had this song like.
He talked too, but a dilapidated garden gave illusion of a security.
From behind soundproof leaves, it could not escape an or word.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father it like something such?
He wanted to say it a joke was, but he hesitated to put in her presence again two fingers to lips.
Already she thought he is weird.
„ he said she seemed to it funny “finally.
Credulously she shook a head, and she blocked to Kevern a view.
In a whole wide world, nothing other than tangle of her raven hairs was to see.
Nothing other wanted to see.
„ you think “, she said doubtfully.
This but does not explain still why you sing me her.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too large feet?
He looked again.
Feet so completely not.
Perhaps little ankle.
Do you claim you hate me because I have too thick ankle?
Do I hate?
It true is not.
Just a stupid song, it is.
He could tell it „, I love yourself “, but that it was too soon.
„ your thick ankle attract me just, “he tried it.
I'm so little úchylný.
It did not fail.
He wanted to be funny.
He wanted to be funny, it got it often into troubles just as its father, he missed a spell necessary to it to manage to tame cruelty, which in jokes of číhal.
Perhaps its father cruel intentionally was.
Perhaps deliberately cruel Kavern was.
Despite kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomonsová flushed, and rose from couch, she dropped radio, and she spilled a not dopitý wine.
A bezinkový wine drinking it did not blame.
She looked in his excitement, he shakes as the palm leaves in a storm.
„ he attracts me zvráceně you're fool “, she said...
Only to it that me this does not attract.
Her it was sorry how, because of its not kind words and because of the fear which she had in the eyes in a time when she stood up against it.
Did she think he will hit her?
She did not talk to it of the life on a cold northern peninsula, where she grew up but did not doubt that in bases, it there was same here.
The for them same vast and ice ocean shattered.
The same mad men, then what happened, than even touchier and grumpier their ancestors smugglers and, kazisvěts wandered angrily from a pub to the pub, ready to reach out a hand to any woman who would dare to refuse them or to laugh.
Stupid?
If he will not keep careful, they will show her fists.
First to pomazlit her - pomazliting become the commonest expression for erotic dráždění between a man and the woman an of on: antibody faint ballads love that radio spewed - first her pomazlit then her one smack.
According to Kevernův's view excessive kultivovanost, mazlení was it an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomonsová not verbálně indicated it to leave.
As old rose from couch.
It she felt cranky, but a weight of its sadness surprised her.
An end of a world, it was not yet.
Hardly they did not know.
She watched how he goes as if - it she seen from the window in a floor - men who it caught up it he caused what.
Adam leave a garden, thought.
A heart her constricted because of it also of all men generally of that few of them beat her.
The man from her turned, did she leave shoulders slump, ashamed, defeat all bojovnost it - why felt to her this look well knows and she did not fail to remember a single moment, only now that this already ever she would see?
Ailinn Solomonsová again it she looked to her feet.
, About twenty years after these events Esme Nussbaum, intelligent and enthusiastic dvaatřicetiletý výzkumnice work in Ofnow, not statutory monitoring system, public mood, prepared a short article on persistence of the light and moderate heavy violence crimes in areas of a country where of its mitigation or directly cessation it expected most if to its removal, it was spent enough of moneys and an energy.
„ it did it, very and much this still he must do “, she wrote „ to calm down congenital aggressiveness of people who fought in many battles and they won most of them and it in the particularly zasutý, barely available places of the country, he appeared a touch historically and despite tops of church towers act over live hedges where of a human kindness only rarely. “.
Some things are but not replaceable.
It would be able to appear what higher a church tower is, it instincts is lower.
Inhabitants sigh over sentimental ballads, not happy stories devour, and they declare firmly believes in a value of a marriage, and family life, but only in rurální areas, old brutality holds as stubbornly in urban agglomerations but evidences show also even new and offensive not tolerance appears home, workplace, in roads and on sport fields.
„ you have a tendency fortunately to a too květnatý style, said “its superior.
I you would suggest to read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed a head.
Also I must ask: are you ateistka?
„ I have think to it, I must not answer “, Esme Nussbaum declared.
Are you dyke?
Esme said again by its right to privacy and silence.
Feministka?
Another silence.
„ I do not ask therefore “, said finally Rabinowitz that „ I would have something against atheists, lesbians or feministka.
On this workplace, we do not have prejudices.
We serve a not biased company.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity perfectly acceptable and laudable can distort a judgment sometimes which is alone so how you demonstrated it.
Obviously you it are prejudiced to a church - the thing which you call to „ cruel “and „ brutal “other as an expression of a natural strength and an energy would be able to interpret also.
Still to address, what happened if this happened as if this happened if it happened yesterday he prepares a country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind a head, it the recommendation which Ofnow the last čtvrtstoletí broadcasted into a world or more flashed růžově on a light board.
Smile a neighbour, care for your partner, listen ballads, go to musicals use your phone converse, explain agree apologize.
To talk is, a zpívaný word is better than written, but nothing better than love is better than shutting up.
„ Esme Nussbaum replied completely I understand your reservations “quietly she was sure that her superior finished „ and longer I do not say a wound did not heal so how we will tell she healed.
Mainly he is my concern that if of it with an advance, we will not be notified, we will repeat the same mistake that led to this what happened if this happened.
Time but anger and a trust we will not ventilovat on other.
Luther Rabinowitz associated fingertips of fingers.
This had to indicate not finite patience.
„ you go too far “, he said „ which perhaps they did, and possibly they did not do your grandparent you describe steps as errors.
Too far, you go also in it you it they ventilovated their „ anger “and „ mistrust “on „ other. “talk.
On your place, I would not have to remind someone that and in understanding of past in protection of presence, we do not speak „ us “and „ them “.
Were not any „ we “, and were not any „ them “.
We know only it this was chaotic times.
During which „ we will be honest “, she took Esme courage „ we're none without blameless.
I blame no one.
Whether already it was fair or not happened what happened.
It was before.
This is not to say what - we agree together in this.
And just does not exist any guilt which to someone would be able to blame, does not exist or things that would have to correct if or correction was appropriate and possible.
But past is to what other than it from it to learn.
Past exists to forget it.
If to this anything, I can add.
Luther Rabinowitz rozpojited fingertips of fingers.
„ I will take your report into account “he said, and he dismissed it.
Day to that when she went usually to work the motocyklista which ran to sidewalk in a way that passersby described as „ brutal and furious “hit it.

The numbers come from a čtvrteční meeting of European Central Bank (ECB.
Markets will want from a bank a clear plan a how to deal with oddalovaný recovery of Eurozone and with a threat of deflation with an inflation stagnující 0.3 %.
Speculations Director, ECB, Mario Draghi perhaps indicated this week he considers a quantitative release of Eurozone similar that to which they came during a financial crisis, the United Kingdom and US appeared.
Although „ an at least growth is than better, are no growth, the brake effect which he has, a grow economy, and geopolitical certainty manufacturers still more visible “, said Rob Dobson, Chief economist Markit.
Of PRODUCTION PMI Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, he fell to jedenáctiměsíční minimum 51.4.
In the second largest economy of a zone, France fell, PMI on 46.9.
A concern is, France, Italy this stagnation switched again from expansion.
Signs this in a drive force of growth in the most important industrial areas, Germany, Spain, and also the Netherlands disappeared also he is not too reassuring “said Dobson.
Slowdown of an industry probably will přilít oil into a fire to analysts očekávající implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Ireland Republic where increased to 57.3, the highest level PMI from an end of a year 1999.
Howard Archer, a chief economist said: it in IHS, Global Insight, best what on a production list of shopping managers for August can say he is „ he indicates that a sector still grows “.
He added: the producers in Eurozone have in a current time a life very complex because an increase geopolitical tension between - particularly Russia and the Ukraine - adds to still challenging conditions in many countries even more of certainty.
Which probably will cause and this increase certainty a trade demonstrably hit - this particularly confidence some orders will be suspended, or even they will be canceled, mainly them it expensive of consumers.
He pointed out that as that „ even more likely “, he seems ECB eventually will have to do a form of a quantitative release although „ we expect to will be only limited “.
Ten of years of a hell of survivor from Beslan: ten years from horrors from an occupied school, children still suffer.
Ago ten years, as a hostage was arrested by the Chechen radicals in the school in the Beslan in southern Russia of a thousand of people.
During the suffering which lasted three days, and that shocked a world, it was killed more 330 of people from which children more than half were.
Us back to Beslan to found some of victims that during the atrocity in the school they escaped a death.
The survivor heroes before the new apocalypse on the Ukraine warned exactly ten years after a horrible occupation of the School in the Beslan which 334 people the 186 children killed last in night.
1. September 2004 at a beginning of a new school year, they captured, and fanatical terrorists, the children and parents murdered, as the deepest bottom of hell, it seemed.
Resistance over tragedy associated east and west which in this disastrous disaster led to a negotiation and a future.
After the ten years, we returned in southern Russia to Beslan to seek some of victims that during the atrocity in a school they escaped a death.
We found amazing young people who resisted a disaster and a memory of a hell cause by the terrorists in them he will live far.
What is their greatest wish?
A war that now destroys the Ukraine - and as in which children they were they die - already to end.
A girl pokoušející se to go back into demolished school gym.
She was caught by front Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakovem, how he tries in the only low underwear to climb back into rozbombardovaný school gym then in it, a bomb exploded.
Confused Aida desperately searched the its mother Larissa which is now forty.
It concerns, both they are dead, but in a fact, they survived.
, „ a woman told me it I run, and I will save a life, but I did not could “said then Aida.
I had legs from blood.
I rose, and she climbed back to found the mother.
A soldier saved her.
After several operations, she thought, already she recovered fully, but yesterday she said: returned of a pain ago three months „.
Me afraid I will need for an another operation.
In a knee, I pieces of shrapnels left.
Her aim, the State zubařka to could help people so as doctors helped her is.
„ this tragedy changed me the life, but certainly she did not destroy it “, she said firmly.
„ just this happened to me, and this cannot change.
Once I go annually to gym to remind those who there remained.
Otherwise on it we try with friends to do not talk.
This pain is too big.
My best friend, and future spolužačka from a class Džeru Gapoevu there they killed.
As small together, we played, and, we pictured how we will go together to a school.
„ I want not to marry, long I will not complete the school, and I will not start a career.
On a family, I will think later.
He says she did not forget captivity, but by an each year, they fade memories little.
I'm glad the many people on an all world still he remembers what happened, and, we're too grateful for help which, we received from Britain and from other countries.
On Internet, I look to my picture how I climb a school window, I say many of people will see it first, he will understand this disaster, and he will prevent it to repeat.
A boy who escaped by rain of bullets, and believed that its mother is dead.
Its first school day (it was, in Russia, children start a school in seven years, and survived three-day siege of the school in embrace of their mother, Tamara.
In that time, seven said: „ mom told me if occurred an explosion, I have to lie to a country, and, I have to hold it a hand “.
After the explosion, he thought the mother dies.
She told it: „ run “.
Him afraid he is dead, he ran, and he seen a way cry toddler he grabbed a child the hand, and they ran spray of bullets.
Its father Vladimir who outside caught it said: „ Damir told me that its mother is dead “.
He says: I could not save it „ “.
In a fact, Tamara dopotáceted to freedom and lay with the in a hospital bad leg, and conversely thought her son died.
Then after again they met she said: I cried „ by happy.
I could not believe it.
He ran inside, and he hugged me.
Damir then flew to London according to (zaniklý newspapers News of The World, by where time prime minister Tony Blair its wife, Cherie, he was declared and by a winner, Bernardo's Children).
„ this terror returns an every day, but I would wish to could stop to think “, he said yesterday.
But I can say memories already fade.
I remember right then, I dropped all my pistols on gambling.
Tonight I can play the computer games but in which he shoots and I do not have with this a problem.
„ me not afraid to go back to gym, but I do not think.
I remember of children with who I played in a yard, and which away did not get.
Never we will say they killed them, or they died.
We say they remained in gym.
On a trip to London, I remember well, mainly it how I could choose anything in hračkářství I wanted, and how I drove convertible.
Now he worries but for places as is the Ukraine where he suffers because of a war as, its friends suffered, it and.
This terror returns an every day, but I would wish to could stop to think.
„ I'm of terribly sorry anyone who by such horror must pass “, says the Damir which involved the last week of the voluntary activity in monastery.
So much, I want to help.
By one, I want to work for police, and I hope will adopt me a next year to Academy.
Does its mother Tamara, 48 „: they killed 37 children from our neighborhood, you it imagine say?
I remember this silence right after the attack. Nowhere no children that here would shout, and would run were, and silence lasted several months.
Vividly he remembers a way with Damir to London.
In London, I told our story, people wept.
Then I realized how the people on an other side of a world will can to understand our feelings, and how he is able to express his support.
Was grateful Cherie of Blair and her foundation for a grant price and a possibility to go to an autumn 2004 to London.
I wish Cherie to could call and personally saying and it is already ten years, I remember the meeting still with it and its husband in London, and how Damir they helped me and.
I remember how Damir was a taste to boršč, and so they obvolated all Russian restaurants.
Also I remember how he played in a restaurant with waiters Damir to them fired from water pistol, and they ran, and played with it.
And it was only a month from that nightmare.
I was surprise, how Britos wanted to share our pain with us, and how they supported us.
She said: I think still „ a world did not change those ten years to good.
Now the war on the Ukraine is, people die an every day, and I think it was, and yet it will be killed and more of children.
The same children as it our, it is.
I think more of people, war just the something in reports which will listen they bore or while they do something else is.
I know these people feel what is a horror.
Still I feel it.
Nothing changed, people still want to murder each, it is so sad.
Damir grew up, and a nice and quiet boy he is not all, aggressive or furious is from it.
For example, he does not want for a revenge this any does not care it.
I know he recalls it , but he has more close to six students and he goes a time from the time to gym, and candles ignite there.
He was smaller, he had with this problems -, I remember, how he lay sometimes to couch with a face avert from us, and sometimes he lay hours so.
He did not sleep, he was open eyes.
Also I remember he threw all his pistols or other weapons on a toy. Damir is today 17 is higher than me, nice, smart, and healthy.
Hardly I can believe I was several hours sure, he is dead and that longer it never I will see.
After an explosion, I recovered, and she got on feet, I looked around and she seen it a hell, everywhere pieces of human bodies were.
I was absolutely sure my boy did not have this hell a chance to survive.
„ I remember, I screamed how ‚ Damir run ‘but I was convince he did not hear me.
But he heard her, and he ran.
Our life goes unlike other further.
Grigory Ilyin 17.
The boy whose acquire photo after an attack became the symbol of horrors in Beslan.
Consolation: survivor from Beslan, Grigory Ilyin, with its mother Fatima after the attack in a year 2004 the right Grigory now.
He ran for the life then after a Chechen terrorist shot its classmates, a vrytý fear was in its bloody face.
Its photo was one of most shocking symbols of the atrocity in Beslan.
Its mother Fatima 54, a doctor dropped off it its first day in a school, and rushed to take its older son Vladimir to a university.
„ I left two minutes before terrorists invaded to Court my boy there left three days it “she remembered.
Not entirely alone because there, we had relatives, but, all there died.
Only my Grigory survived.
How this date approaches he is still harder on it to think and talking.
He or a single day will not pass to do not remember this tragedy.
Does not seem to us this happened already long I have a feel it was yesterday, some moments, I still return.
I promise that no one never will forget.
Still recurrent memories: picture, Grigory, to left were one of most shocking images of an attack, and as the statue right were zvěčnited (.
I remember how Grigory he enjoyed that day very to a school said he wants to hug his teacher.
He is alive I learned I seen it in television.
In San Marino, even the statue of cry Grigory is.
Grigory at this photo looks like, and home we have it hidden in knihovnička.
I understand it, but also I think that this image, people on an all world know what pain we feel.
Now Grigory says: he is important „ this longer to do not repeat.
„ I doubt ever we will know truth.
Similar tragedies still investigate, but no one ever will know truth.
Now they examine this accident of the Boeing on the Ukraine.
Will we know ever after was a cause?
This world something very bad waits.
„ do not I understand why this happens because if people you will ask, nobody wants a war so how, is this possible?
Ten years are for such pain nothing.
At least little to forget, he needs decades of years.
It had it an effect my health still I feel it.
I had three or four years because of an attack of bad nightmare, but then it improved.
Then in a year 2004 me back to a school, I was an every day frightened.
I thought its, friends and classmates, which they killed.
Therefore I go he approaches of 1. September to gym.
I want to honor a memory of the friends from childhood.
Is for me hard into that gym to enter, but I must.
I do not feel as a victim this story is past.
I will not forget it, but I do not regret.
My life goes further.
Year I completed a school, and he began to study the medicine at the University in Vladikavkaz.
I want to be kardiochirurg.
First I wanted to join an army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but because of health, I did not could.
I wanted to fight for my country but will not go this.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20.
A boy who survived although it they kept at feet of a homicidal terrorist.
A miracle: Gregorij Farniyev was held during an attack at feet of the homicidal terrorist nevertheless, but he managed surviving.
When was the attack in full progress was captured trap in gym how they sit beside a bomb at feet of the homicidal terrorist.
The real miracle he survived, it is.
„ it seems to us “, said if as it was yesterday Gregorij who wanted to become an agent of a Federal service safety but that because of injuries suffered during the attack he did not could.
Still it is with me, something I threw what for a head, it is not.
Now it I'm older, and he says children with bad experiences will have to cope better - I must say it true is not.
„ in a year 2006 I went to a psychologist, and it me was then little better, but I cannot forget.
And I would forget like.
The in the year 2005 - year late - it was first and last after gym again I entered.
I fainted.
There I will go again never and do not want after me, I please to shown you where I sit in that well -known image.
Survivor: Gregorij Farniev today, on laptop with by its photograph pořízená in a hospital after an attack.
This pain, he is huge, and, I carry it an every day.
Friends know it hate, I think, or, I talk, and never they ask me to a school.
What regards of a physical health, I'm in a fine.
I must be careful to my knee which I injured, but it I walk normally.
But and so for the health I could not get, and I could not study to Academy, FBS, in Petersburg how I wanted.
I sent them their documents medical reports, and they answered to me that it is not possible.
Animals and I got to veterina are my next hobby.
I finished there the second year.
He learns how to treat all animals from „ cats to cows “.
He said: I know „ that my children it never, I will tell.
It is not something the children would have to know what and already not something they would have to experience what.
Its mother Marina, 42 stated: this pain will be here „ always.
He is inside, and he deteriorates with approach anniversary.
I will attend of připomínkový ceremonies.
I know Grigory will not go.
It must be for it even stronger because there unlike me he was.
I for it waited at home, and I could not help it.
I'm to God so grateful that me it he returned. Here traces are in Beslan everywhere.
It remains with us.
Gregorij is now adult, but it carries this horror further.
Is hard to adopt to you, something so very unfair happens.
A boy it is, he has like a sport, but he cannot do it because of his knee.
He underwent several operations, he can walk, but he cannot exercise.
I would say so he overcame this horror already from 50 % but to overcome it completely and forgeting does not go.
This terrible experience with us will be still.
During an attack, they killed many of our friends and neighbors, and a pain only aggravates it.
I lost many of people which I had like, and who I was close.
My son is with me and that this greatest gift is, what me God could give, but a loss kill hurts me.
I know families, in which other children bore but also widows that longer did not marry again.
Is hard to adopt a life goes further and you do not want.
Never I will forget how me a heart jumped almost from chest I seen it in a hospital.
Now I observe, what in a world happens - the wars in other locations.
For what do these people fight?
Why do they kill each?
The war now approaches to our country which hardly I can believe.
In past, we were one friendly country, how just did we get to it together now, we fight.
People and children suffer certain I was the many children on the Ukraine and yet it will be killed.
If thus all these rebels we could take and we could throw them - it will go furthest how.
Alyona Tskaeva 10.
The child that special commando took to safety.
Being saved: Alyonu of Tskaevus the Russian special commando left) carries to safe.
Now the it ten right) is, and all he does not remember tragedy.
The world in a year 2004 gasped after breath when small Alyona, gave in an arm from beslanský captivity a Russian policeman.

4 under tips, how water to take better photos and videos.
If you concern photoshoot or shooting under water, you have to available a large choice of equipment.
The cheapest option as kompakt for example Nikon, Coolpix Aw120 or an outdoorový camera of the type GoPro Hero3+, Silver Edition, which stands around 300 dollars is.
I made these photos on a family celebration the several cameras they stood all fewer 350 dollars.
He is one, what equipment you use, but to achieve of the best results, several rules apply.
Check equipment.
And you have the waterproof camera ensure batteries and other parts are tightly close.
Next set the camera according to it what type of the photos or videos you will purchase.
Some cameras and cameras have the scénický or natáčecí mode which optimises exposure to the dark environment under water.
And before it you will start find out how deeply you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are intended in only 5 tracks, another to 50 or 60.
Read of our guide purchase and evaluation of the digital cameras in normal and waterproof execution.
Do always several pictures - much, he will not emerge from them.
The compact cameras have LCD which you will help with a composition of photos, but outdoorový does not have it.
And LCD you have under water, he will see bad, and, the composition of scope will be not předvidatelný.
Always do more of pictures.
If has the camera the bracketingový mode which series of pictures with slightly different scatter of exposure does take it.
Stay close in a level.
With deeper draught of a light, he decreases significantly.
If is it possible keep in photoshoot in a pool, a lake or a sea close of the level.
It also will allow you to locate on photos more of the light - you will dive what more deeplier it less of colors, you will see.
Get close to a fotografovaný object.
This excellent Council is if you will photograph on a land but he is under water even more important for the dimmer light.
It is particularly important if you shoot with an outdoorový camera: such devices have the usually firm and broad angle of a lens which means if you want to fill fotorámeček, you must approach more to the objects.
Andrew Lawson a human whose force of a personality managed to change things also even in the so huge organization as NHS was.
It anesteziolog devoted its career to it to ulevovat sicks from a pain cause by an illness and a treatment.
Its wife remembers one of humans, who sought its assistance officer Mi6 who had to live with consequences of a torture that maimed it was.
Lawson that while doctors will concentrate on diagnoses and diseases the treat patients in overwhelming majority, cares completely, something other: the pain understood.
Of one day in a year 2007, it who began to suffer was but.
„ I do not feel in my her “, he wrote in May of this year.
I felt without an energy.
He faced with symptoms of flu, and he found that he is impatient and he includes his wife of Juliets remorse.
He noted: „ I want everything to happen more probably sooner later “.
Juliets for a week, she left on a business trip, Lawson was usually and not vysvětlitelně upset.
Something was not in wrong.
A colleague to it made x-ray of chest.
Before he skied one two weeks in French Alps.
Results of x-ray came.
He had the mezoteliom, not vyléčitelný tumor, which affects pohrudnice or - výstelka of lungs.
For most of types of a cancer is hard to identify what was their cause.
Although some smokers will get the cancer of lungs, not all patients smoked with the cancer of lungs.
Mezoteliom is but different.
Almost in all cases, that was called more previously by the cause of exposure of asbestos to a - building fibrous material for „ wonderful “but he knows now that he is deadly dangerous.
For most of us was not to ignore difficult mezoteliom.
Asbestos finally belongs to past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos in Britain does not use from 60. years when ban of the use of asbestos in an industry came into a force.
And in a time when asbestos was used with it, only certain groups of people for example, pokladač of isolation, came stavbař, carpenters and workers in shipyards to a close contact.
Toxin use in the industry in another era now as a cause for concerns appears hard.
Such samolibost but is not on a place.
How he turns out in Britain, mezoteliomová epidemic culminates now.
A number of deaths mezoteliom is here higher in any other country in a world.
2 500 deaths on this condition annually he is twice more than the number of victims of car accidents.
The number of deaths, consequences of mezoteliom annually from a year 1980, and the estimate deaths in a future in Great Britain.
Although a reason why we feel its effects only now, is a use of asbestos already the years not legal all types of asbestos finally were banned by a law in a year 1999), he is that usually he takes several decades before mezoteliom will develop.
The disaster in a form of mezoteliom not does not concern of only veterans of a construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases, he is still present in the homes, in which we live in offices where we work in schools where we learn and in the shops in which we buy.
Mezoteliom therefore does not respect a social layer wealth, profession or age.
Privileged bastions from London department houses for public schools are not shelter.
And Parliament is full to asbestos.
In which even also a hospital would have to treat us, a storages of this fatal carcinogen are.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor he did not consider isolation.
He tried to find where he could come into a contact with asbestos.
Then to it he came.
„ is possible more of asbestos, Guy's hospitál was in suterénní corridors “, he wrote where I spent six years on a practice.
All - students, of a sister, doctors, and doorman - they used corridors.
Is a question what of my současníks will get the same disease?
Fortunately it the question to which he managed partly to answer was.
„ of four doctors who Guy's hospitál was at the practice, and then in past five years mezoteliom occurred “for which, he commented in a letter in a year 2010 „ I'm only still alive “.
How of us will he sicken?
Andrew Lawson with mezoteliom was diagnosed when it was 48.
When 17. February, this year, he died, it was 55.
To survive with this diagnosis is not so long usual.
He will die 55 percent of people diagnose with mezoteliom within eight months from diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
Now therefore can we repeat Lawson's question only how of us: he will sicken „ by the same disease “?
According to a front british expert to mezoteliom, of Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is between the years 1970 and 2050 when the asbestos epidemic in Britain happens, he will die about 90 000 of people.
Most of them in a current time does not have an idea that he will die in this way.
The asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada.
In cursory inspection into files from archive of courts on which, disabled turns often, and, they require a settlement, he shows how a mezoteliomická disaster spread much.
For example, a company Marks, Spencer, admitted this June & that from negligence, she exposed to asbestos of Janiec Allen.
For a chain, she worked nine years, from a year 1978 to roku1987 when she supervised in two shops a section with clothes - a trade a flagship ship company was one of places, on Oxford Street.
Allens were only 18 when for M &, S, she started to work.
Today he has two children, which he is over twenty.
Before „ before it happened “he says „ I heard before never of mezoteliom hardly I knew something on asbestos.
Never it imagined me or in a dream somehow he would be able to concern me.
He is not many of people who on asbestos something knows.
In a fact a but group of six minerals one substance, asbestos is not.
He got a name to his fibrózní structure that it gives a strength and ohebnost.
From six minerals, three was used in construction.
Most oftenest is now in buildings possible finding chryzotil commonly know as asbestos.
He was used in roof panels, floor tiles in bojlerový gaskets and even in brake lining.
As other forms of asbestos EU and who nevertheless they consider it for a „ great health risk “that can cause a death are not so fatal.
More dangerous brown asbestos is amosit and blue asbestos (krokydolit but (.
Britain was once the largest world importer of brown asbestos and, experts say „ exist persuasive but not circumstantial evidence that it was a main cause of the not usually high incidence of mezoteliom [ in the United Kingdom ] “.
Employee marsk & Spencer to asbestos was exposed in the flag shop in Oxford Street in London.
Janica Allen maybe does not consider as a typical victim of mezoteliom but of work Julian Pete he points out to it that her story all is not usual.
Its studies of patients claim that a „ substantial part of cases of mezoteliom without the known exposure of asbestos in work, or home probably was caused by exposure of the asbestos in an environment “.
The considerable part of this exposure is caused by a „ common use and zvětrávání of “buildings.
He seems no one sure can být si that he is in safe.
A report, Goddard Consulting which examined westminsterský Palace, shows that or people into a centre of a government must not know maybe they are exposed asbestos.
In a year 2009, Goddard published the message according to which are contaminated behind rooms of a parliamentary committee service elevators and pipeline whose mortal fibres would be able to be violated by something so harmless a „ strong current of air is “by asbestos.
Ministers often are blamed of it they care of only their own interests, that in this case but, can be opposite true.
Although Directorate of services, Parliament took on this westminsterský Palace to get a „ positive medical certificate “, he counts now with it he will be necessary, one million of pounds and of several years of work Parliament thoroughly to be reviewed electricity zmodernizovated, and he removed asbestos and after elections in a year 2015, members will sit more likelier on the green benches in Westminster in premises of the conference Center of Queen, Elizabeth II.
In a report, Goddard, he stands that „ presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations “.
Is not possible to tell whether this compliance will be lives.
All now can wait only.
One of persons who never they were able determine when they occurred to exposure of asbestos, Graham Abbott is, a doctor.
Just as Andrew Lawson, also Abbott) has a 50 suspicion that to asbestos, he was exposed at the work in hospitals.
„ I worked in a hospital where presence of asbestos was proved, “, he says „, but in my case I cannot prove it.
He is difficult, to remember all places, where he worked, and when he worked there.
Clearly he remembers a day but on a beginning of December 2009 when something as chill overcame it.
It was 45, he evening was and just he was of an operation.
Suddenly I trembled.
It came once.
I was miserable.
I thought I will not get a car of homes.
Because was a doctor, he knew a pain comes from pohrudnice, of the výstelka around lungs.
But Janica Allen did not have a reason anyway to believe this is mezoteliom.
Finally he spent at home a month.
The confused doctors to it did x-ray of chest, and put it thoracic catheter from lungs to remove it the liquid which they sent to an analysis.
Still they did not set diagnosis.
Its condition slowly improved, and he returned to work.
To it, symptoms returned a time but from the time often then after he zacvičited and he zadýchated.
In a year 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to an operational room with similar symptoms, and subsequently mezoteliom was diagnosed in it.
Nor then, Abbott associated nothing but with his own case.
An end of alls, its patient was several decades of the years older, and in work came into a direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, a connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and its doctor zkonzultovated its images from CT and x-ray with a panel of experts.
After in December 2011 exactly two years late, Abbott started to feel badly, it a probe equip with a camera was introduced by výstelka of lungs into a space and výstelka of thoracic cavity.
I'm optimist.
I have tendencies much to take nothing “, he says.
To been honest much with it me not do not it worries.
But Rachel my wife, worries did.
Results of biopsy arrived between Christmases and New Year, they told me „ mezoteliom it is “.
Graham Abbott: being diagnosed with mezoteliom.
Abbott began to see with nurse from a charity organization Macmillan and one advised it to contact a lawyer.
Into this moment, extent of epidemic realized.
In the „ it turned out asbestos widely was used mainly large public buildings, which have the often asbestos thermal insulation in a pipe “, he says.
People who in these buildings of asbestos were exposed now a disease begin to show.
Mezoteliom therefore now begins to involve of younger people who do not have risk professions.
These most dangerous pipes thermally insulate by asbestos in hospitals were in basement, was therefore not likely that they would endanger patients.
Who but members of personnel went suterénní corridors as Andrew Lawson or the fir in suterénní canteens like often Graham Abbott) they came to a contact with a toxic substance clearly certainly between the buildings (.
A how he shows now several decades of years after a war of a hospital were place, where patients they could save a life but also the place which could endanger the life of doctors who treated them.
Asbestos removes still.
Students built Bunsen's kahan to asbestos pads.
And there is not only the hospitals.
Asbestos often used in offices, shops, libraries, and halls because of its excellent insulation and not flammable properties.
Also in the schools.
In a fact, many people of asbestos were issued already in the school.
Somewhere students built Bunsen's kahan in countless hours of chemistry on an asbestos pad.
Website sites a deal by the question of asbestos in the schools arose.
Harmless things as, floor tiles or, roofs of shelters to the tool in our homes contained asbestos normally.
„ Andrew Morgan notes, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in its charge against Guy's hospitál this is industrial poison build in a large quantity home “.
In one case, an only contact with asbestos to which a woman suffer by mezoteliom managed to recall in 70. years in boření of a garden house went.
Give careful how you bořit the garden house.
With a knowledge that a disease is not léčitelný, impact of diagnosis is huge.
„ he takes while before you it will get “, says Graham Abbott.
Me back to work and, he tried to continue, but I found I cannot concentrate to it I do what.
On an operating room, I was two weeks.
Then I realized that I will have to leave and I will have to deal own.
Well, other Christmases, I will not live.
One of the difficult things, transition from a position of a doctor to the position of a patient was.
It a countless number of the patients before it also it remembers how felt confuse from an amount of the information with which he had to deal.
„ it all was hard to understand “he says.
„ did I ask of my doctor: a how time „ I leave “?
Me it twelve months was told.
I remember how I said: „ well, other Christmases, I will not live.
So it is “.
Mezoteliom is particularly destructive because it mechanism this what an it breathing keeps us alive - - is it what causes the cancer which kills.
Most of cases of mezoteliom is caused by exposure of asbestos.
Small fibres are asbestos.
Asbestos will break and fibres will breathe, they can settle in pohrudnice, výstelka of lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate pohrudnice, and can cause a mutation of cells.
„ a problem poses the vdechnutý asbestos fibres in a shape of needles, “, kardiochirurg, Professor Tom Treasure that in a year 2001 hospitál joined Guy's explains.
To the same hospital, Andrew Lawson was exposed apparently where to asbestos, and which is the paradoxically lead centre in a treatment of mezoteliom.
Treasure he knows Lawson, and he treated and other patients who of asbestos were exposed probably during a practice in the hospital.
Needles of asbestos get into a tissue of lungs says Treasure, and „ an it breathing pushing them an edge there where výstelka locates.
It is its nature from very beginning invasive.
To mezoteliom of a normal treatment option use, they do not work much in other types of a cancer.
Žhavě he discusses for example efficiency of an operation.
According to some her worthing for a try.
Treasure he does not agree.
„ you cannot remove pohrudnice “, he says.
You will not get around her scalpel.
The cancer „ too does not respond to chemotherapy “which not „, has an effect “, but does not treat.
„ someone who will survive the cancer of lungs will occur occasionally “, says Treasure.
But all will die eventually.
Fortunately some patients live much longer than it expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
From their own diagnosis, Graham Abbott fights two and still half of a year.
After a finding of mezoteliom, Abbott contacted with Andrew, Lawson that the, four years from its diagnosis became, individual support and a consultant for equally ability people.
They called happily he introduced a „ good day, you reached: to headquarters of a cancer “.
„ he was very positive “, says Abbott.
They diagnosed a disease it ago four years, and he was still very active.
On a beginning, they offered Abbott six cycle the chemotherapies which would last four months, and probably they would extend a life its only for a month.
„ I was desperate, “, he says.
I wanted to give up it.
Lawson but „ he managed things showing in an optimistic light “.
Then after he visited several doctors Abbott decided to continue with the in a treatment professor, Loic Lang-Lazduskim from Department of the thoracic surgery in a hospital Guy's hospitál.
„ I had an advantage that I had not to wait to it to will send me but only I called there, and they examined me “Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get žádanka, and would have to approve it a payment.
To could get to the best available treatment, a question of moneys is for the patients with mezoteliom key.
Which but they will leave tu the different treatments finally will fail inevitably faces the many patients other financial troubles - for a future of a family.
And therefore he addresses to courts, and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson Field Fisher Andrew, Morgan, contacted Waterhouse, LLP.
„ from a year 1898, it knew asbestos health is harmful “, says Morgan.
In the 60. years, it found but that also its very small amount can pose a health risk.
And here we meet with negligence of businesses.
Andrew Lawson and, Guy's hospitál dealt finally, but according to Morgan, it a „ full-fledged settlement “was not because Lawson finally could not show that mezoteliom was the consequence of exposure of asbestos in Guy's hospitál.
After an investigation of a case, a speaker Guy's hospitál confirmed but that the „ asbestos in an inkriminovaný suterénní part was removed in 90. years “.
It was for Andrew, Lawson, too late.
How to remove asbestos.
To blame exposure of mortal asbestos to one company of an or exercise of work - usually decades of years late so it happened - it proved for patients with mezoteliom aim on compensation to be a huge problem.
Many of former workstations, it changed a hand, or it failed.
Evidence of insurances lost.
Which their prosecutors and those who now opposes charges has on their side a time certainly not.
In a reaction to this fact, the important new legislation which is for patients with mezoteliom easier to seek of a settlement if and is not possible of their former employer to dohledat was approved this year.
A law created a 350 miliónový financial reserve, which, insurances pay, and which is determined by people diagnose after July 2012 that who they can show they were exposed to asbestos but who have not to sue.
In such case of an ability will get 80 % of the amount which a way settlement - approximately 120 000 of pounds in the normal case a court would award them.
300 successfully ongoing applications expect an each year.
Andrew Morgan as, patients think with mezoteliom 350 million of pounds „ good work “is.
„ an agreement draw up by insurances for insurances it is “, he says, and he points out to it that a sum is quarters it insurances would have to pay what if he did not hit a time, and people with mezoteliom would be capable to dopátrat former employers and in a normal way is to sue.
Also even Mike Penning, former Minister work and of social Affairs admitted that a law „ had spaces “.
But admits Penning and Morgan a fast action was seven deaths the every year necessary.
„ people too suffer, and they need help right “, said Penning in December of the last year during the second reading of the law relate of mezoteliom.
Graham Abbott 19 months Loic, Lang-Lazdunskiho, was in custody of Professor.
To the for which after initial consultations he recommended Lang-Lazdunsk operation he thought to Tom, Treasura, he has a positive effect.
After the operation, followed - the triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can chlubit a rate of survival the five years in when 40 % of patients radiation and chemotherapy.
It strengthened Abbott.
„ it this most important thing is not of course “, says Abbott.
In patients, you see this still.
Exists something what drives you.
If you will give up, your condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent in March to the 2012 operation.
Of August, last of six cycle of chemotherapy completed.
Control inspections did not reveal any symptoms of a disease.
A further control, I went in March [ 2014 ].
In chest, I had rozesetý several stains [ of a cancer ].
Just my 1950s birthdays approached.
A life does not threaten it.
It takes it.
Abbott again underwent six cycle of chemotherapy.
In a current time, no traces of tumor are in its body.
It is but a physically and emočně exhaustive process.
You must think practical things - to a financial security when, I will die or to it to shown a woman how the alarm on boiler works.
You will hear of bad news, you will become being negative.
You must look forward.
As for a father, Ellie 16), and Tamsin 14) it is not always easy.
„ he says for parents, it is hard “.
To decide to say and how to say what it is hard.
After diagnosis, I said girls my condition means never I will be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
It told friends, and suddenly it began to call us many of people.
Ellie was more reluctant.
It she did not say it.
Such conversations all patients with a cancer must face.
In patients with mezoteliom, such conversations are not odlehčited but by a hope or an only hint of a chance for survival.
A disease brings and finally also Stephen's Jay Gouldovi brought) not bleak certainty.
How says Andrew Morgan „ mezoteliom does not threaten a life “.

An American tradition penetrates into a university life - prváks can fly a jet plane.

A service is an ideal option for students who otherwise would have to drag their things over the entire State in a dangerously laden car.
We enjoy that our VIF (very important fresher - very important prvák with variants this year for students, we will ensure to a university, they will arrive with minimum of nervousness and maximum of luxury.

Feministkas after the events in Ferguson oppose against racism and a behaviour of police.
On a beginning of the month, police killed in the Ferguson in Missouri not armed young.
Present Pending to funeral with hands upward the hands air skandovats: „, do not shoot “.
After two weeks of the protests in the Ferguson in Missouri for zastřelení, not armed young, Michael Brown, bloggerka, Miriam, Zoila Perézová recorded the shift in online discussions of white feministka.
She found when will come to a promotion of reproductive rights and equality of incomes, they prefer white feministka of a sex before a race.
With the increase tension on Midwest that drew attention of national press, Perézová noticed that a reaction of běloška in 100 % will concentrate on the race.
To the reactions of negresses soon after shooting, 9. August, personal Article with titles, one „ reflection of běloška over Ferguson “or „ feminismus is not only on utlačování of women “appeared relatively late.
According to Peréz, this constitutes an important change but.
„ I think in a feministický movement, many of people who would talk the race and on privileges at such level is not “, she said.
People felt that to this what happened, he must comment.
For the crisis which we face the situation in Ferguson, it is characteristic because [ ] is so rasově vyhraněný to it, they had to point out.
According to the Professor of English at the State University in Ohio, Koritha, Mitchell, Ferguson issued a light problems that Afroameričankas must face an every day, and that in a cultural sphere as „ female questions “is not seen.
„ on Facebook I can publish funny stories from a life with my partner, and 150 lieks will get it from people from an all world “, said Mitchell.
When I will write something about it coloured they are in their own country in a trap silence, it is deafen.
„ is how possible that a woman publicly can speak relations but on the not safety in a public area “she asked.
For blacks as, it, the Mitchell which dealt with an issue of a race, gender and sexuality in an American history do not exist between questions of the race and a sex of dichotomie.
Women according to her could not allow luxury přehledně to divide these problems: an every day, they live in this mixed reality.
Although běloškas now a question of a race and gender in mainstreamový feministický circle combine, say Angela Hatteryová, Professor, the speaker woman question, and gender studies to Georges, Mason University, their předchůdkyně made opposite.
Between years 1865 and 1890, it was lynčovated at least 10 000 of blacks, and a reason it was almost in all cases of rape of běloška “, said Hatteryová.
To justify of lynčování, you needed cooperation of běloška.
According to Hatteryová split between běloška and blacks, he came warriors for a voting law, such Susan B. Anthonyová examined at an end of a 19. century terrain, and realized that the electoral right can have only one group of people - women or blacks.
„ they chose to bet cards to the voting right for women and on the right for blacks to focus later “, Hatteryová explained.
If this we will realize, we will get important view to it why they do not believe color women běloška.
We did not do a good job.
Never we helped negresses to protect their husbands and children.
And then, the ten years took after women in a year 1920 acquired the electoral right before they began to organise against the lynčování in Association of southern women to prevent of lynčování.
The group the 40 years arose late negresses first said for help.
According to Mitchell of vzedmutí of responses of white feministka to questions a the which an event in Ferguson brought, racial discrimination - question of behavior of police -, he reflects time, when, white feministkas had to catch up the “questions „ with which negresses faced generations.
If „ it would not be great, the aktivistkas on these areas of [ traditional feminismus ] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception “Mitchell nadnésted.
The second wave of feministka that did a career by a fight for a reproductive law and access to contraception now figures out this means what.
Way significant feministický aktivistka Gloria Steinem took two weeks after zastřelení of Michael Brown by an attack Facebook where they published a column, Rebecca Carrollová from Guardian, that demanded it white Americans razantně to object against racism.
Who „ I hope that women have, different but nonetheless similar grounds for the understanding of a danger in a society - and of opinions on a race in polls public poll differ significantly -, they will seek a to change “, Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem holds the intersekcionální feminismus which includes questions of the race and gender, they confuse her comments to the question of the race in America some people.
Odbornices, American Enterprise, Institute Christina Sommersová, an author of a book who „ stolen feminismus “said for her The people that the young men in the United States, the especially young coloured men are „ much more vulnerable than their sisters “, but remarks of Steinem of parties, Ferguson faces the criticism which she triggered already earlier.
We have now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women but for almost any boys.
But it caused when White House started a small program us Brother's the Keeper which had to help vulnerable young negros and Hispánecs in many feministka Gloria, Steinem, angry reaction.
A relationship police to a black community an only problem that comes to fore of an interest of mainstreamový feminismus is not.

If there we headed straight so yes.
But still other two erzetas waited us, and it did not could.
A high temperature and a risk that a car would begin to burn, it was large are in it.
I cannot afford it.
In full pace, you managed five speed tests.
What from them, did you have impression?
Very good.
I felt zamlada.
We were quick yet I did not go over Vint.
All was cause this that the car we piplated more than half of a year to been at a level.
A race showed that us this did.
You started it so realistically you could think to a victory.
I prepared also the car so for prize, we had really.
Work did not come vniveč.
The to which on an other hand result we could think he did not appear.
But that barumka is.
A technique fortunately said not.
You were not only from the tip which prematurely resigned from a fight for prvenství.
, Also foreign favorites Breené Abbring or Lappi it got.
Did it surprise you many favorites resigned?
Yes.
For mainly audiences, it a pity was because a race it early ended.
On a top, also the Jaromír Tarabus which you prepare a car moved long.
But he it paid, he flew from a track, and he picked up almost dvouminutový manko.
How were you with its performance happy?
Shame it is because he could repeat degrees of winners.
It he zajížděted the first second times.
But also Mira confirmed that the car we prepared well.
He went very fast.
Ago an exactly year, you announced an end of a career yet you appeared Barum rally on start.
Of you, can he make a good feeling from ride a regular participant again of rallyový races?
In this moment certainly not.
Last I said barumka my last race is, and as I did not observe it.

But I think on nothing further.
Lot of people arrived a track for only you.
Did it please you?
To a degree, we started because of just them.
A lot of people known or unknown constantly asked if I will go.
I wanted to make them happy.
What does expect you after barumka?
A team continues further.
We will go a next week to Vyškov where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope a car here did not damage little.
Moreover Fabia Honza Sýkora wants to borrow from us to this race.
With Mira, european dvojzávod in Switzerland and on Corsica waits us.

He does not appeal.
An oral agreement with an employer a problem can be.
Fortunately you did not let to issue from the doctor a certificate work capacity which serves way evidence for an organisation that for health reasons, you cannot perform service duties.
Moreover you did not notify absence the employer immediately.
Subsequently the it reached agreement that days will be recorded as vacation an agreement, but was only orally.
Although Code of Labour does not impose an obligation to let in write to confirm the agreement of an employer with a drawing of vacation, this procedure proved in a practice.
If will occur an only oral deal, you do not have on an agreement of confirmation.
Later alleged consent with the drawing of vacation can be as in your case being denied and absence in work being considered as long-term not omluvený absence a therefore reason for immediate abolition of an employment relationship, Section 53 of Code of work.
For the case of a court litigation, agreement with an employer, you provable evidence miss so.
The employment relationship with you but was not canceled in Section 53 only you have give days being listed in a zápočtový sheet as not omluvený absence.
The not omluvený absence in the zápočtový sheet does not have the same consequences as Section 53 example. a not possibility to receive the material security in employment, the this ztížený possibility of a search of a new job is still.
We you recommend again to see that doctor and to have in writing confirming that actually occurred to an accident of which, you were of work not capable him this is not so-called." neschopenka ," there is the only document of the doctor.
Find of the new job, you can produce that document and to explain a situation.
In a practice is appropriate to do not underestimate how exposure of a write medical certificate work capacities and an early notice to an employer or a request of write consent with take-up of vacation.
You will avoid so of any complications.
An accident, Tony, Stewart, in a return a track.
The return for the track an Atlanta engine Speedway only the short behind half of the race track ended for Tony Stewart.
Stewart second crashed a rail then after it in a 172. round blew the right front tyre and after a race for it ended.
Stewart imported a battered car to garage, did not comment reporters, and left.
Head of its team Chad Johnston said the team of the car, No. 14, is disappointed, but now he will concentrate on the race in Richmond that in Virginia a next weekend will carry out.
„ I would want to have a better performance and a better conclusion “, said Johnston.
We will go to Richmond, and we will hope that us there he will do more.
Stewart hit a rail first in a Sunday evening race after a conflict with the Kylem Busch which required correction of the right side of its car.
„ we put hopes to the today race good ending “, said Johnston, and added „ it did not work out: just “.
Not long after the second accident Stewart's car it was loaded, and a team was packed, and was prepared to departure.
Then what its car hit, and killed an another driver on the race in New York Stewart left out the three races NASCAR sprint Cup.
He decided to return this weekend and to this he needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the following race in Richmond to caught up the place in a table.
To racing, he returned during an investigation of the tragic accident at which the 20-year-old Kevin Ward, Jr., which to Stewart pulled during a race into a path died.
Authorities said prošetřování of a cause of the accident will last least other two weeks.
Yet it did not decide on it whether Stewart will face with a charge.
A three champion before the race received of a warm encouragement.
Stewart began on a 12. place, on a beginning of a race, he propracovated se to 10. and then even to the 4.
Then, on the beginning, 122. wheel, Busch's car, No.
18 it got out of a control, it came from the second curve, and it crashed Stewart's thereby it sent the both cars to a payment.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to a 21. place.
Prague selected new managers, habitats taxi, he will earn 12.3 of million.
Prague completed competition procedures new managers, posts of taxi.
For 103 parking stalls, he will obtain annually roughly 12.3 of million of crowns.
For the recently same sites for drivers of the cars taxi she chose 150 thousand annually so of crowns.
Councillor Lukáš Manhart TOP 09) informed about it.
More previously a city used lot in selection of administrators.
A winner then received a lease for a standard sum 1000 crowns for a year.
Rules but changed.
Currently an amount of a bid decides.
Say a councillor " the year from termination of original rental agreements and an initiation of selection procedures it proved that a new system leases is for Prague far more preferable and generally fairer."
The expensive spot is on Perštýn.
Candidates for the station in the Street on Perštýn offered the highest price.
Annually he will pay 2.1 of million of crowns.
About 1.5 of million crowns, new administrators paid for places before municipal House on or Wenceslas Square.
New rules of an of leases of sites of taxi councillor adopted to autumn of a year 2012, and in summer of the last year, they terminated original lease agreements.
Selection procedures held in four waves, and 29 stations found a new administrator.
Already second year, we had to clean a well.
Always we launched entire it, which the practically other pond around cabin created.
Then there we poured savo.
Not credible stench.
Our well in cellar provided always enough of beautiful fragrant water.
And it was not kdovíjak expertly do, Grandpa vydlabated it svépomoc.
It long.
To she was just so three skruž and generally svérázný indeed but how, I say all on a cottage.
Water was great.
And until letošek.
When we started a season, we exhausted water of course.
As there she stood a number of months, she deserved it.
But us it seemed and then this water somehow to do not smell.
It wondered us if there something did not fall.
In a place, a pump it in little of luck was possible there a board did not come quite, a hole seal by a piece of a brick was so passed where.
Our inspection confirmed that by the brick, it moved.
Otherwise there was nothing in water to see, and we prosvítited it only to bottom.
Again we drained it, and they přečistited.
Of course, we improved the impromptu seal around a pipe of a pump.
In cellar, we noticed but strange things.
On ground, he lay an ulepený package with some kostička.
So it looked at least.
And distance away another.
Now it looked like an oslintaný mouse.
In ceiling, remains of fish were in places where, Grandpa's invention vents are.
And heavily jetý.
Our cellar is too svérázný.
Someone would say grandfather simply podhrabated cabin.
And he would not be so far from truth.
Walls and a floor only a packed sand the only ceiling is podbitý are.
They give there mainly ships.
And wheels.
And couches to a beach.
Gates with wide spaces were mostly open, someone went in one piece there how.
In ceiling several already these vents.
Without a network there birds will zalétávat normally, and on beams, it builds nests.
On the mice is necessary to mention.
Grandpa wanted to luftovat and it that again right.
Now or luft did not help but.
Whole cellar smelled.
We cleaned therefore also whole basement.
Especially this fish on a beam was nourishing.
We threw out also things, what: boards was around, a heraklitový board, and so.
Our cottage to a distance welcomed by passing infectant odér.
Did we wonder who there could natahat us those not nasty residues?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers here in a village.
Hardly to us she would go having snack.
One neighbor that is not fully in wrong attacked Grandpa.
If it this Franta us these not chutnosts there did not put by vent?
He is tu practically for an entire year, stupid by ideas it has.
We decided to watch cellar and a well and regularly to check.
After few days, all in an order was.
Again we started to use water yet only to wash and laundry, they will be, ready tests, but already it was good.
To pull water from forest studánka there is nothing I would want to do what too long.
Once we heard terrible anxiety barking of our bitch.
Mom looked from balcony, and seen in the grass beside porch long strong black hose.
Réza over it bobbed, and crazy squealed.
Mom scolded it because she thought Réza digged up waste hose from sink.
Suddenly but this hose smotated partially into a ball, and partly drew up.
To balcony, hiss hit.
Réza got a hysterical attack.
We ran down.
Užovka long very over a metre and thick as býkovec she prepared to swallow huge toad and in it, she prevented Réza her.
Not do not it clear if toad she wanted to save if or it she wanted to devour own but that was not material.
Užovka seen odds in a form all of our family probably she said it, we will eat it then if we're such hunger, and elegantly she squeezed by vent into cellar.
We flown after her.
She jumped it lightning for a well.
Just so way, we recorded on her board an another foul package.
According to a smell about fish.
Yesterday there she was not.
Our new security around a pump was little šejdr.
And we locked this cellar and over a day.
It.
We went out and there we lay each to one vent.
We did not wait long.
Behind studeň, it zašramotited.
First a flat head with the yellow měsíčeks on a neck appeared.
Then entire užovka jumped to a well.
She wrapped around the pump, and she began to conquer inside.
A waste employee retaliated, bought to a company notebooks, and sold them.
The zhrzený employee after a release bought to the company of a computer, and then he sold them.
He made before still by detention police to spend an obtain moneys.
During a short time, a man bought in twelve cases the total sixteen computers more two hundred of a thousand of crowns.
To " after takeover, he wheeled notebooks Olomouc he sold them where after bazaars ," said Chief Commissioner, šumperský police, Rostislav Brückner.
A theme of frauds vengeance for a release was an employer and also a profit of moneys.
" He told us in a hearing that moneys he used to instalments of loans " Brückner told.
Police also found that impostor is a pathological player who repeatedly treated to psychiatry.
Moneys so could end in also, výherní devices or videoloterijní terminals.
" A fact is in it, we did not find any moneys ," said Commissioner.
Who impostor already once was punished under theft, now the residence in the prison in a length of one year and of the five years threatens.
Polices yet did not communicate also to the bazaars which under a price bought notebooks, and far sold them a sentence faces.
" True is they took over the completely new goods which are least suspicious ," said Commissioner.
None of owners of bazaar but was accused yet.
Come still a, bit, you will manage it, or how I enjoyed us Run, Prague.
Year for us organizers prepared several changes.
This greatest, a change of a route that brought a target to náplavka instead of her leading back to yellow spa was.
To a race, I enjoyed with a remainder Rungo.cz of a team I prepared but to live it so little from an other side.
With the whole team, decided personally to greet our readers on a stall, where together picturing, we, and shot videos.
To dragged its view from the other side to perfection, I taken a role of personal conductor.
With friend Káťa, we joined obediently just before take-off to an end of a corridor 60 or 70 minutes.
We greeted with friends who around us passed to a sector for faster runners.
Longer it did not leave little of a time.
, switching few of minions to rozehřátí sporttestery countdown and start.
Cries of jubilation but cupitání followed of fast Start to a start line.
After five minutes, we occur to a gate, I turn a measurement, and we rozbíhat with pace, hour ten.
We weave by a yellow snake of runners who similarly as Káťa run their first race.
Far all looks svěže, slowly downward sun on a sky almost when kýčovitý tint gives to a view of Vyšehrad.
A vibrant mass stretch after waterfront looks here whole Prague would run.
On waterfront between Vyšehrad and National Theatre, he starts traditionally to show who has how forces.
A light hill on of Palacký Square forces many runners to slow down or to switch to a walk.
Just before overrun to theatrical, I see police escort, and behind immediately it, Vítek, Pavlišta, flies a not credible rate in an objective.
I hear obdivný ufuněný vzdychání of other runners.
I move to an edge of a track, I encourage it prepares with me to slap but, just before it, I a leg will podvrtnout and our hands a just mine.
He ran by a theatrical street he gives a chance to short rest and rozdýchání.
There is a need before us, the places on which me views will knock out breath are.
The turn on Mánes ' Bridge shows the Prague in all glory of sunset sun.
I do not breathe, and feet carry me almost it.
Behind the first občerstvovačka, a moment of truth occurs.
In overrun, road Káťa will škobrtnout curb, and performs jump plavmo.
I watch if he does not need help, and I start series of encouraging words to do not have a time to think to a pain.
He rises, and we continue by goat Lane it is one of the narrowest places of a track, in this stage of a plant, it such crush nevertheless is but necessary well to monitor surroundings is not anymore tu.
Yet I do not know that a concept the narrowest place will receive its true importance later.
Beyond dusty Gate, tourists encourage us freneticky and, they associate of other runners.
I try to clap with everyone, who will offer a hand, and I also Káťa advise it because ten tlesknutí with fans, is such half of an energy bar.
A fact it works, again we accelerate and enough we fell significantly now a fighter journey began.
We předbíhat dozens of runners I pass someone especially tired, I try to encourage it with few words: " go still a, piece you will manage it."
For last občerstvovačký, no one předbíhats us longer, we accelerate.
Far we ran to an hour and a quarter we add, he is not for what to wait.
In an objective, they will hurt three kilometers, but there is a need really to máknout.
Sun already set slowly, and symbolicky slowly, a race terminates an end day.
The last paddock to a bridge, a turn and it only rovinka to the objective.
The pace which we run he wonders me where it takes in this girl?
" Let we go under an hour thirteen, we work " I call.
We try it, we sprintovat, and an objective is here.
The hour thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can do.
A coach entered a limit, hour twenty.
Seven minutes under a plan.
Which a super result is.
Just behind a goal, Káťa legs will podlamovat, I help it to railing where he rests a moment.
He is on it to see exhaustion but also luck from a well Test performance.
After while, I take it slowly outside from an area of a target.
Euphoria does not give to think us of the crowd in passages to rooms.
Here is to see goat Alley was not this narrowest place.
This he is only here behind an objective the náplavka which is under a pressure of almost ten thousand of runners stuff to burst.
If someone does not have like the crowds the place for it, it is not.
And I after while lose a head, and I wonder and those beautiful views to the last years a more interesting route worth it what happens in a goal.
From an own experience, I know an organisation of a plant no fun is.
If to this, will add ten thousand of people a rich accompanying program and a closure of the whole Center of Prague for all transport, a huge challenge is of this.
A year change route showed to runners many interesting places, but she brought also several really not pleasant surprises.
Excellent atmosphere rozpumpovaný in yellow spa transmitted between runners also in the it plant.
The organizers around a track, also random audiences stupňovated it on each metrum of the track.
In an urban run the historical center, it must count fortunately with obstacle does not can to remove which but I do not consider a target of the mass race in a place that on one hand is bounded by a wall and on an other river the best solution.
If I will ask that the race ended by proběhnutí by an objective, I assess it as very good.
Behind the objective, I was a little fear health, of interested, but finally it turned out all well.
Write to us in a discussion if also you, a route enjoyed and what you say on the situation in the objective.
The prison guards in Bulgaria protests organize.
Hundreds of employees, prison service in entire Bulgaria, participated of the national protest rally before Ministry of Justice in a main capital Sophie.
On a peaceful demonstration, they repeated their request, reintroduction of the original working conditions which in a recent time changed.
On a list of requirements that have to be discussed with interim Minister of Justice Christo Ivanov, also higher salaries are.
Guards symbolicky protested a month against a new working hour, and demanded a return to original twenty čtyřhodinový shifts.
And unions of prison supervisors although officials of Ministry of Justice met did not agree bulgarian State radio, BNR, informed (.
„ negotiations are still “, said Bnr head, General Directorate-General of a prison service, Rosen Zhelyazkov.
He expects that to protests of employees of the prison service, will connect also members of Federation of union organisations of the employees on Ministry of Interior.
Why he can have universe more of dimensions, and we do not see them.
Physicists usually do not write bestsellers, but Brian Green from Columbia University in a year 1999 a shot to black managed.
Its book, Elegant universe became for laymen the most accessible way how to penetrate to thicket of problems that now a number of theoretical physicists deal - effort to unite two beautifully function but mutually not compatible discoveries of a 20. century: a quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of reasons of a success of Elegant Universe is doubtedly of a search of the united physical theory there is not a dull story.
Physicists the basic problem between the two key theories (but) into this moment our universe is De facto divide into two worlds with different laws solved, and resolves so nápaditě they are it to převyprávění also laymen.
Greene with a complex material handled moreover so svěže and poutavě it is not blaming how interesting to his book he did not include.
Moreover corrected its " mistake ": a structure of universe and from a most part a hidden reality in the other two books.
Apparently or an author would not object any against it if its book zastarávated faster but a fact is that also after 15 years, Elegant universe provides still almost all important informed layperson with an ambition to understand what a world would have to know this important part of theoretical physics.
Is relatively likely in next years, he for that slightly vivid (need it, accelerator, LHC, will go finally to a " full gas " and so a good moment is to enter Green of not violently open doors of the world of modern physics will be in this area still just.
How dimensions can have our universe?
An idea that our universe has maybe more three spatial dimensions certainly can sound foolishly fantastically, strangely or mysticky.
Still he is specific and completely acceptable.
To understand it averting moment our eye from universe as of whole something mundane specifically to long and thin garden hose to zalévání.
Imagine you will extend stometrový garden hose on one side of canyon for the second, and entire scenerie you track from a půlkilometrový distance in a picture and on a next page.
From such distance, you will record long in a horizontal direction outstretched hose easily but you will discern thickness if just you do not suffer bystrozrakost of hose hardly.
Due to your great distance from hose, you would think an ant donucený to live on hose has only one dimension in which he can walk: the levo-pravý dimension along hose.
If of you, someone will ask where the ant into that time was, you will answer to it (only with one datum: distances of the ant, of left, or of right of an end of hose).
This all, we want to say only this that from the půlkilometrový distance, looks a long piece of hose like a jednorozměrný object.
In a real world, hose has thickness.
If all we will increase, we will see suddenly the second dimension - in a shape of a circle ovíjející hose.
In a this enlarged view is clear that the ant in a fact can move in the two independent dimensions: in the already well -known levo-pravý dimension after a length of hose also in the but " dimension / against the direction of a movement of clock counterclockwise " therefore around kruhovéhoprůřezus of hose.
You begin to understand that to determine of a position of small mraveneček, you must enter two figures: how he is far from an end of hose, and where he is on a circle, ovíjející hose.
This reflects a fact that a surface of hose is dvojrozměrný (note. Experts will see that this chapter concentrates purely on a poruchový theory of strings.
12. and 13., the chapter discuss not poruchový aspects.
The surface of hose is dvojrozměrný: one long longitudinal dimension is shown by a direct arrow, dimension in a direction of a circuit mark by the circular arrow he is short and coil.
Between these two dimensions, a clear difference is however.
The dimension along hose is, long and easily visible.
The dimension ovíjející circumference of hose is short," curl " and less noticeable.
To realize existence of the circular dimension, we had to study hose with a significantly better resolution.
A this example he illustrates important characteristic of the spatial dimensions.
It they divide into two groups.
They can be either large, vast and therefore directly noticeable or conversely, small, coil, and much less observable.
Of course, we did not předřít just in that case to discover a " rolled-up " dimension ovíjející thickness of hose.
It was enough to take to aid telescope.
If but hose was thinner - as a hair or capillary, we would reveal the rolled-up dimension only with a great effort.
Kaluza sent in a year 1919 to Einstein his article in which he came up with a stunning idea that spatial geometry of universe would be able to have more the three than us all known dimensions.
Kaluza justified his radical claim it that an additional dimension provides the elegant and convincing framework in which is and Einstein's general relativity Maxwell's electromagnetic theory vetkating into a single, united pojmový structure.
Immediately a question how this kaluzův goes the observation together with an obvious fact that we see the just three dimensions of a space imposes.
An answer which Kaluza quietly assumed between lines and, which clearly gave, and specified swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in a year 1926, stands, and falls with a claim that spatial geometry of our universe can have how large and rolled-up dimensions.
This means that as the dimension in a direction of a length of hose has and our universe the large, vast and slightly visible three dimensions which's existence by any moment we realize.
But he can have the universe also additional dimensions with a circular circuit of garden hose analogously tightly roll into a space so not small far they remained being hidden and from our perfectest experimental apparatuses.
To get a clearer picture on nature of Kaluzov of a remarkable proposal staying still the moment in hose.
Imagine to the circuit of hose, we will draw by black color relatively dense series of circle.
Afar hose looks still like a thin jednorozměrný line.
With telescope, we will reveal a rolled-up dimension to a drawing now even more easily, we will see namely a theme from an image 2.
Clearly we see that a surface of hose is dvojrozměrný with one dimension large and almost not limitless and with other, short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came with an idea that our universe has a similar structure but he has the three large spatial dimensions to one small circular dimension together therefore čtyřiprostorovédimenze.
Is difficult to draw an object with the too many dimensions.
Little to help its imagination noticing of the illustration in Figure. 3; he indicates, the two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In a picture, we increase a view at geometry of a space similarly as we increased a surface of hose.
An each subsequent level represents huge magnification of geometry of the space from the level previous.
(If our universe can have additional dimensions we see them at the fourth level of zoom, they are curled up into the sufficiently small space; it we vysvětlovat si yet we did not observe them directly.)
A square network represents an of the commonly know " great " dimension, a circle, new, tiny, and rolled-up dimension.
As just loops of the threads in a densely utkaný carpet, also these circle exist in an each place of the usual dimensions -, we zakreslited them for názornost only into the only intersections in a square network.
A background, picture 4, shows a commonly know structure of a space - the ordinary world around us in - such ordinary standards, meters of the show aside small box in a square network are such.
On an each following figure, we will focus on a small area of an image previous; we will increase it to become visible.
Initially nothing special happens, we see how at the few first levels of magnification.
But we will refer on our way behind microscopic properties of geometry of a space further - to the fourth level of the zoom in Figure 3 -, we will see suddenly new, into a shape of a circle rolled-up a dimension similar to loops of the thread in a densely woven piece of a carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came with an idea an additional circular dimension exists at the each place in a direction of the large dimensions similarly also hose has the circular circuit in an each point of its length.
Of názornost, we zakreslited the circular dimension in only some regularly space points.
A picture 4, Kaluzovu, and Klein's idea of a microscopic structure of geometry of a space summarises.
A similarity with hose is obvious though we record also important differences.
First universe has three great, only of which two far rozléhající spatial dimensions we drew) while hose has great dimension only one.
Even a more important difference will tkvět in it now we speak on spatial geometry of universe it just on a to not subject within universe, perhaps our hose.
A basic idea is but same.
If is additional the kruhově coil dimension extremely miniature to recognize it is - as a circular district of hose - much harder than observing the obvious, large and large dimensions.
If is - a size of the additional dimension enough small, he will reveal it over in a fact also forces of our modernest tools to zvětšování.
Most important he is but that an additional dimension is not mere round hrbolek within the normal dimensions, how a dvojrozměrný illustration suggests mistakenly.
The circular dimension is the new dimension that exists in an each point of the three normal vast dimensions.
The dimension on the other three dimensions independent, it is as the dimensions of shora-dols and zleva-vpravo are (zepředu-dozadu independent and perpendicular) each.
Sufficiently small mraveneček would be able to move in the all four dimensions, and to destination of its position, we would need four data a still the position in the circular dimension;, we count - and time to three usual, then of data five, in any case one more than normally we would expect.
Did it deliver you?
You can purchase a book Elegant universe, Brian, Greeen, here to knihy.idnes.cz.
A price for e-kniha is 149 - CZK.
To our surprise, we find therefore that we're aware of existence of only three dimensions of a space, show Kaluzovo and Klein's thinking that this is not precluded existence of additional rolled-up dimensions if they are - enough small.
Universe can have still more of dimensions than how them we can see a naked eye.
How small would they have to be?
The state-of-the-artest technical equipment will prove recognizing structures large miliardtinas of meter.
Hardly we can observe Menší of a rolled-up dimension.
In a year 1926, Klein, original Kaluzův's idea with several thoughts from a just nascent quantum mechanic, combined.
Its calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension would be able to have a size of approximately one Planck's length therefore to the size far behind a resolution power of today devices.
It then, physicists call a possibility of additional small spatial dimensions a Kaluzovou-Kleinový theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises how to practise on an electric guitar,: 5. part.
He consists in the dvanáctitaktový harmonious form which arbitrarily you can repeat whole essence of " dvanáctka."
Who gropes in a musical theory, he will find its principle in detail explained here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Capsule (1976).
By education puppeteer and loutkovodič whose facebookový profile is tracking here from graduation ago twenty years feeds as grafik.
He is guitarist of a band the Wohnout from which he cannot leave fortunately allegedly.
Guitarist is after a father as brother Matěj a, leader of Wohnouts.
With trénování start on one string.
" A rhythmic model invents only you anything you, is enough it then applying to the harmonious model of dvanáctka ," Honza advises.
If you will add the another string, you can obměnit a figure again.
He is enough, to listen and to follow John what with dvanáctkový harmony on the two strings can devise, and how nicely already can start to sound.
If you will take - the third string, you can koketovat already with melody of any song.
When finally you will add fourth, care a change of tuning Honza points out in a video.
Next Honza him back to pentatonika, and you will try it putting together just with dvanáctka.
So it honestly train.
How best, you will read it in the conversation with Jan Homola in the first lesson of its school of a game to the electric guitar here.
An another goal without Wait?
To large slavení, it is not, hradecký Dvořák recognizes.
We take a point, and we're for it happy.
We had the first half more of chances, other," who us domestic attacker time scored from pokutový kick related.
Were not you in its zahrávání nervous it just huge pískot accompanied it?
Somehow I did not see it particularly or on an other wicket where, domestic fans it probably would be worse are.
Penalta after half you settled, but you also got the goal from penalta already after not full four minutes.
What did happen?
We slept a beginning, we were passive, a corner arose from it and after it then penalta.
After it, you rose, and the first half you were a better team who had more of chances.
Why did it change after a break?
Hard to say.
I agree with that after a collect goal, we played and to break well.
In cabin, we thought that also after it, we want to keep up pace of a game, but we did not fail it.
To tell truth or me not do not capable explaining why.
True is but about also domestic on the break to its game told something probably they were not with it much of spokojení.
On a field of a match, you bodovated only first while you are need yet they did not get home the or goal.
Why is it such difference?
I would not say such difference, it is rather he depends on us how we will fight with this.
In Brno, we began well, but then it, Plzeň it an other category is was from us bad.
Did you wait the four games for a goal, you were not a worry that it after the last game can be similar?
It perhaps or really but course, we're glad from the last match to must not listen talks on waiting to the goal.
Now we added without wait, other, but still only three is in the six matches which even to great slavení are not.
ICELAND - lava přitékats from kilometres of remote crater.
Lava vyletující to the surface in the area holuhrauns near glacier Vatnajökull přitékats by an underground tunnel from by kilometers remote crater.
It is under glacier an as so part of that underground lava tunnel.
This fact now concerns scientists most.
A situation now remains not constant.
From a yesterday morning (31.8.
2014 still he will vyletovat from fissure the approximately same amount of lava.
To original estimates, its quantity is but lower, not 1000 m3 but " only " 300 - 400 m3.
To previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 he is only 50x greater.
Scientists but fear the lava tunnel would be able to open also in places where he is under ice.
If so it would happen on what moreover current eruption demonstrates with similar intensity huge floods, it would mean and it, how, River, Jökulsá á Fjöllum, and other rivers.
In vicinity of eruption, he is to smell a strong smell of sulphur from rift, clouds of steam and gases rise.
Certainly this is not on eruption suitable for tourist tourism as it was of the eruption in Fimmvörðuháls in a year 2010.
This is much larger and ," says also he is tu much more gases vulkanolog Ármann Höskuldsson.
Weather but improved considerably from yesterday, almost a wind was in morning hours in an area.
Traces after a sandstorm storm were washed by rain.
Scientists can continue in their work.
For an air traffic, an orange degree (other highest), Bárðarbungu and yellow (third for Askja applies.
A sky over Cheb brave Ladies, Peggy, was.
She walked wings.
The air day in Cheb.
On a machine, Boeing Stearman PT air akrobatka Peggy, Walentinová, introduced that in a flight came from cockpit to the hrazda on an upper wing of dvouplošník and also between the wings.
There she is referred the only strength of muscle.
The air day in Cheb, year held already popáté, and organisers again managed to prepare several interesting air items.
On the oldest Czech airport, said only " walking premiere after the wings " in administration of German akrobatka, Peggy Walentinová, but also a legendary fighter P, D Mustang or aircraft, Beechcraft 18.
It tore attention by its bright team.
Akrobacie call Wingwalking has the origin in the US.
After 1. World War, it tried so to promote many former war pilots.
But he was prohibited because of a large number of fatality accidents.
Today but he returns slowly to a program of air days.

Genetic disorders often are diagnosed poorly.
A woman from Britain describes how she thought many years after bad diagnosis he will die.
Then after she was diagnosed with an other disease Rodgersová spent Karin most of adolescence in an impression her he has only few years of a life.
In a fact, this was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT - the group of hereditary disorders which harm nerves outside a brain and backbone.
A charity organization, CMT, UK, stated that bad diagnosis is between people with CMT a common problem because on a disease, he knows only very little.
He it that in the United Kingdom suffers CMT about 23 000 of the people which can show symptoms motorika as are a muscular weakness, clumsy walking and the twisted toes on the toes has.
In disabled, he can occur also, not numbness or a pain, this condition is not léčitelný and progressive, which means that by a procedure of a time, symptoms worsen.
Thirteen Rodgersová was, thought FA - by the disease which have very poor prognosis he suffers by Freidreichový ataxia (.
She believed before he will celebrate 18th birthdays, he will be upoutaný to a wheelchair chair and dead before she will be thirty.
Which a mother of two children is now 51, he says: that „ I knew it a child I cannot do the same things as other.
I fell an every day, and all took me longer.
Never I could drive with the other children on roller skates or skateboard and in a school šikanovated me for it how I walked, and she ran “.
Rodgersová was thirteen and, was after several operations, which, to release of her Achilles ' tendon and to straighten feet, used of it her doctor that it left from a room, and consulted into its documentation where she learned FA suffers.
Because „ I felt guiltily, Tracker, and so I did not tell it anyone but I returned home, I found information on the disease in a library, and I wrote in Association FA “he says.
When me they answered, I was in shock completely I panicked.

I think it will be something much less to a life not life-threatening “.
After completion of several genetic tests, it found that has CMT.
„ he explained to me what CMT is, I thought I'm a child of lucky “, she said.
A charity organization, CMT, UK, started a month of awareness on CMT to this disease to point out.
Entrepreneur in an area, Washington,: taxes rise with turnover of an economy.
The grow economy means more of customers higher sales and new job stations.
And also higher taxes.
Which according to a new survey a, national and local taxation of companies with the in a country urychlování of recovery of the economy slightly it increased the last year, and companies in Washington were not an exception was published the last week.
Entrepreneur in Maryland and Virginia together took for the fiscal year 2013 into national and local coffers 27.6 of billions of dollars, which a 3.8 % greater amount 26.6 of billions of dollars select in the year 2012 are.
Tax burden - State and, local - raised the last year for 4.3 % 671 billion of dollars the 3.9 % last year, and this was the third growth year after the years 2009 and 2010 when taxes reduced.
Which according to a study a professional company Ernst & Young and political group Center ON State Taxation state taxes increased faster for 4.3 % than local contributions for 3.9 % conducted.
From a more than half of tax revenues of a district, 56 % he is business tax and 36 % of revenues, Maryland, is from companies.
Virginia with 28 % shows the proportionately smallest tax revenues from a business.
Researchers claim that a majority share of growth of the tax revenues comes from an increase of a value of properties belong the companies which taxes from a property three increased this year with growth -1 % after the consecutive years for 3.7 %.
Although most of a profit comes from large states as California, New York and Texas, he seems the same situation is also in Washington.
The companies in D. C. Maryland and Vriginia paid the last year over ten billion of the dollars on state and local taxes on the property, which represents an annual increase to 9.6 billion in the year 2012 for 4.2 %.
The apparent increase of a value of the properties but does not drive up the state and local tax revenues much in Maryland where he is a tax from a property a not whole fifths taxation of companies.
For the companies in Virginia, and D., C., he is the tax property almost half state and local taxation.
It, Executive Director of the Centers State Taxation Douglas Lindholm explained „ in Maryland, he owns more of estates of the companies mainly base of the tax in an area D. C., a government or not profit-making organizations that do not pay the taxes “.
Maryland is force much more to rely on the for example taxes on incomes to pay for the same services that are in other states.
A recent increase of tax revenues from a business cannot be attributed of an only uzdravující market with estates.
According to data, he seems incomes from the business also increase.
Companies in this region published a tax from an income of trading corporates 2.3 of billion of dollars that increased from 2.1 billion from a year 2012.
Maryland on the taxes from the incomes of trading corporates selected one billion of dollars, most mostly in the region.
Although they go the same direction, local tax burden of businesses does not grow in these three places as fast.
A rate of the growth in D. C. was at a level of national average to 4.3 % while growth of Maryland was significantly higher 4.9 %.
In the only Virginia, an increase of taxation under average 4.1 % was.
Virginia has of all three circuits (of which all has the same taxation the lowest taxation of incomes of trading companies 6 %).
The rate of the tax of trading companies in Maryland is 8.25 % while average, D., C., remains relatively high, 9.975 %.
The similar study which an American commerce chamber performed this year showed that Virginia has the lower state and local tax and generally more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
The D. C. study did not evaluate.
And despite this advantage, Virginia of a pressure of a competition from south faces.
North Carolina recently signed a law reduce a tax of trading companies 6.9 % 6 %, as Virginia, and the tax will reduce a next year 5 %.
If he will be in the upcoming year still to meet income targets, a by statutory prescribe rate of the tax of incomes would be able to reduce in the year 2017 and to 3 %.
According to a recent study the small entrepreneur in Washington, he does better and therefore the higher state and local taxes pay.
The trade tax odváděný by the small entrepreneur as the tax from personal incomes - structure of compensation of an increase of costs by the increase the prices according to which most of companies in D., C., Maryland and Virginia she increased the last year 20 % to 2.4 of billion of dollars, much faster than other taxes is organized -.
Researchers a trend and the national increase of a business tax will continue a next year probably, total tax revenues from sale for state also local governments in a comparison for the same period in the last year, he will increase of the first three quarter of the year 2014 6.2 % claim.
Washington but can lag behind other because a reduction of state expenditures chooses its toll on a labour market.
What you: a boss of Europe he will be, Tusk, Putin's Novorusko and Lafata's scissors missed.
Will the new State arise on the Ukraine?
Putin called to a negotiation, Novorusko.
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned a possibility of the creation of the new State on southeast of the Ukraine where government forces střetávat se from April with proruský insurgents.
European companies warned also that after a current system of protiruský sanctions, they will have a difficult return on the Russian market.

In the head of european diplomacy, italian Secretary, Foreign, Federica Mogherini will replace Catherine Ashton's.
Still European Parliament must confirm Italka in a function that so becomes Vice-President of future European Commission.

Anywhere do not hurry and get sleep.
The last days of the holidays are before us.
He can use the return from a sunny beach or a cottage to normal work pace to be for a many nut.
Even and depression can accompany it.
Fortunately good tips how with a changed situation to cope: to do not rush and to take quality sleep exist.
: we keep a family of Joans, Riversová, „ thumbs “.
Of Joans Riversová is in conscious the three days from a time when they brought her to a hospital, New York City, but her daughter expressed now that he does not lose a hope that jednaosmdesátiletý komička will recover.
„ we thank for your greetings and support “, said Melissa Riversová in a today statement.
We hold her thumbs.
The Sinai hospitál according to which after a call occurred in it to a cardiac arrest on the yorkwillský endoskopie in Upper East Side how a source stated brought her mother to Mount into Thursday to an emergency service.
Doctors deliberately keep her under an influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they will not be sure with her condition which remains „ serious “.
Reactions did not leave long waiting and that not real support on Internet from personalities as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
A reality is překrucovaný headlines.
Medias překrucovat their subtitles the reality no new is (fortunately).
I know headlines " " newspapers sell but I know also fortunately many so-called " readers " who nothing other reads are.
And this the fact which the last day very worries me, he is better rather a word pisses off is.
This concerns of on the of especially Article conflict Israel and Hamas in a zone, Strip.
Quite common there is headlines " Israel attacked to Gaza."
A to in an of in the only text, you will read israeli " attack " he was reaction burned-out rockets from the zone, Strip, and this often time declare truce.
It then a headline will appear, both sides violated truce "."
Does a journalistic community that by this its procedure directly contributes in antisemitský positions (after all Europe and only there) which they grow realize?
Or sixty years from an end of 2. World War did not pass.
Still people who survived Šo live.
I seen videos of the Federal Republic Germany where a crowd shouted passwords of " jewish motherfucker " and similar zhůvěřilost, it zatrnouted me.
Does this want a world to finish it what Hitler did not fail?
Do our journalists realize a fact that after jews, they were intended to liquidation Slovans?
Ladies and the gentlemen journalists, devote I please little more of care your job.
Often you are called for " watchdog dogs, democracy."
So it defend.
Long he is tu.
And defend also the law of the single really democratic State in Middle East to protection of your population.
How would you want to preserve our government if one of our neighbors decided a Czech nation will dispose, and he will wipe off the Czech Republic from a map of a world?
Perhaps you would have to realize more one fact also.
On a territory of the State, Israel, lives almost 20 % of Arabs with an israeli citizenship.
And he them is there well.
Them you will ask why they do not go to " your " maybe Gaza why, would, answers you do it?
In Israel, they are work, social securities and the top health care it to own eyes I watched to the how top private hospital Hadassa that is financed from sponzorský gifts, Jews from the all world normally and Arabs walk, and there they are treated understandably.
Hamas by its missiles attacks also to its arab brothers.
An only real aid to Gaza and it also of this not troubled area he is, to deprive her of Hamas and to disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel not directly in headlines.
Inform of practices, Hamas, of its abuse of people as of human shields.
Inform about it that Hamas for an objective has to liquidate to stand at Israel and that any price.
And at a cost of a death of innocent arab children.
Inform about it that Hamas is on a list of World terrorist organizations.
Inform about it that for nine years of the authority in Gaza, could be this area vzkvétající a humanitarian aid from an all world.
Which even also from Israel there supplies the water and the electricity for which managers, Gaza, do not pay but, and even excite that in this time sometimes, supplies of a power are interrupted.
If Hamas did not invest moneys in construction of underground tunnels by them to could penetrate the suicidal attackers on a territory of Israel but perhaps into construction of apartment houses, hospitals and schools would live to its arab brothers from Gaza much better.
Amazon buys for 1.04 of billions of dollars, Twitch.
Amazon just confirmed a claim, Information from a Monday morning,: and hundreds of other things a video a streamingový service, Twitchology, buy an online retailer - a producer of videos - 1.04 of billion of dollars (of 970 million, American dollars.
Announcement caused surprise not because that no one would expect, Twitch someone will buy but because it expected that a buyer there will be YouTube.
Ago three months, sale of Twitche Google for one billion certain looked, and this combination looked natural.
Twitch which ago only three years she established Justin.tv, he had being našlápnouted to this to become the generally use video streamingový service a - live version YouTube.
It quickly a platform for players who to it - Business insider „ YouTube broadcasted online transfers from games with words for a vividly transmitted play “became.
Interaface Twitche.
On YouTube, popular videos are already „ Let's play “species, mudrlants mostly older give to games processing where, Mystery Science, Theater.
A fact is that YouTube in popisuTwitche come to přetřes more reports that YouTube kupujetwitch anyone much did not excite it was učebnicový example this how an establish company will pay a possible competition.
A mystery is why an agreement with YouTube did not come although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
A statement CEO Twitche Emmeta Sheara is all in a current time, we have it to available: we chose Amazon „ because he believes into our company he has the same values and a long-term vision, and he wants to help to meet it faster “.
An another mystery, he is - frankly - not credible a success, Twitche.
Who for snobs me claim as I'm a sport rather does before they follow is hard to understand what is so of amazing on it of a game of an actual play only observing.
One thing is to look into the three in morning a friend over a shoulder, how Resident Evil plays, and the completely other thing is to observe someone foreign how he will get twenty interventions in a head in call of Duta.
Which you would be able to watch the all games just.
An another problem is lot of today, most popular games is from a perspective of a player to look at their record without it perspective you would be able to control a quite good recipe how to get bolehlav is.
I admit the games of a type speeding the run in which Rogers Bannisteř of our electronic time will complete the game in the record time are funny.
But its channel on Twitchi will not be probably if someone is not a master of a play or humor very interesting.
But what on this do skeptics I know.
Twitch has monthly 55 million of visits, and is fourth on a top of an Internet traffic.
How exactly will this Amazon use?
Is hard to imagine that Twitch will vmíchat Amazon, Instant VIDEO, as elegantly it used, it would be able to swallow it YouTube.
Twitch but something an each company: hordes of young men who advertisers want would want to attract what has.
How said Director Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch „ he believes in a future of games “, medias do not look and she would resist or - polknutí - viewers.
The second basic lie of kreacionizmus.
Another Czech translation of American ateistický vlogger, Aron, Ra.
Time " Holy fonts an on a topic God word are."
An original video being attached.
Faith is the second basic lie of kreacionizmus that sacred texts were written by God and by not real human authors.
With believer discusses on one of many things is that their religion, he will put us often before a question: who you will believe?
The alleged God word or the word of a human?
If it a human examination was completely trivial to an authority what, they imagine their doctrine has.
But he talks says the " human " on a science.
And they referovat to a " word God referovats " to myths on God by register people.
If really exists intelligent with tvořitel with a purpose it who created a fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history and it who invented genetic patterns must be, which, meets to it, and it who supplied other series of evidences that demonstrate exclusively to an evolutionary conclusion to the last detail must be, it is then.
Why would all these things exist otherwise?
He seems as if he tried to tell us something.
People could not create any of those things.
But people am able to tell stories, fabulovat.
And people who wrote all those texts that pretends they are a word God it was.
Each allegedly holy teaching of any religion in a world describes it as by draw up people, not gods.
By people who were being moved " " or " being inspired " by its favorite gods, or maybe they listened to diktát of angels, but those texts were not written by anyone other mere mortals with a degree of imagination not angels and already not god.
If really existed one true God a, ultimátní entity of an entire space, über-galaktický supergénius would be an integral part of the all gods of all religions.
If a being of such size ever wrote a book a, only font Holy, only one such book would exist.
She would be know everywhere in a world because without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, mere human authors with such work would not be able to measure.
And people blindly would not have to believe it because consistent would be supported by verifiable and true evidences and because she would zjevovat a deep morality and a wisdom far exceed all human limits.
Permanently she would inspire an each reader to unity of common faith.
If her would write God, we would expect nothing less.
But he is it we see what of this exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion lead to a final truth, we have the many different religions without a common origin, and all constantly crumbles increasingly more of separate denominace each in a way claims and the look issue truths divine guidance of ongoing rozbíhavost and the separation in an each direction.
A Jewish tóra, christian Evangelia, islamic Koran, Bahá'u'lláhův's Kitáb-i-Akdás, Zarathustra's Avesta, sikhský Adí-Granth, Mahabharátská Bhagavad-Gita, book Mormon's, or, book Urantia all are considered as " absolute true " and " zjevený word of one true God " and competent believers each of them say those other is to scestí.
An only logical explanation probably is that on scestí, is to an extent all.
None of above of the abovementioned books has other no advantage.
None of them has evidence support, and any historically cannot confirm.
Me it Dr.. Paul Maier, and I'm the professor of an ancient history at West michiganský University.
I do not say I proved that Bible is reliable and historical exact.
Of course he is not.
Still you must have faith.
From them, require all faith and also apologies (because defences contains, consistencies, absurdita, and primitive ideas once consider true that already were overcome.
Is not saying they are evidence of a divine wisdom.
Many of them hideous atrocities promotes instead of morality, and on many of them, he claims they were confirmed by fulfilment of prophecy - with this each too can contain the prophecy which was not filled.
Front teologs admits all sacred texts of any religion were written with human hands, and therefore they are a subject of interpretations, impressions and looks of their primitive and often prejudices bind politically motivated writers by which they account many of protimluv and regularities in these books, of especially then those in Bible.
I would not call it protiřečení, rather mutual comments.
Again we must point out to it that here we have two different authors whose work somehow was mixed together during a redaktorský revision.
He is the right that Genesis has a more than one author and certainly he is not a story of an eyewitness witness.
Some experts now four different sources distinguish for only Pentateuch it. five of the books " Moses ' " and to Moses they do not attribute autorství any of them because almost certainly, he did not exist so in Bible, he is described.
The experts will agree on it Geneses she was composed (by probably Ezdráš of several mutually not related oral traditions before less 2500 years.
Other documents were filtered in this same in a time, and all is attributed to the human authors.
Bible is not or accidentally so old how its believers think.
Scrolls from Dead Sea are the oldest archaeological discoveries of texts know for their not finished basis of all western monoteistický beliefs and yet they are many century younger than roots of zoroastriánství, of an of buddhismus, hinduismus, helénismus, Druid cults, Chinese or egyptian religion.
Christianity began, as a gnostický belief, docéts, and ebionita followed and their entirely other views, Jesus that finally combined in a compromise of call ortodoxie.
Other christian groups as luciferiáns were scattered, and were discredited other revisions, Bible.
One of these uprated relates to King, Ugarit who ruled ago 3500 years.
Because its followers represented a major threat for the young mojžíšký religion, authors of a New law decided to zesměšnit and Baal Zebula changed," the " Lord on a mountain to belzebub ," Lord much."
Bible deliberately and fraudulently was amended how, for religious and political reasons.
Remainder part this what became by a new law was kanonizovated in the 4. century over the. letopočet. in series of the komisní decisions on the Council in Nikaj.
Four Gospels were adopted, and sixteen other if as a reality of a thing could accept, or could refuse by a vote was rejected by simple catch-the-eye of a hand.
The way by which kánon developed depended on this what read on Sundays in time christian centres.
What did read on other Sunday after the Easters in jeruzalemský Church?
And the what in the roman church in that same time?
And gradually they found that he approaches those same evangelijní stories.
And so core of kánon this developed from the Usa of initial Church.
Simply he accepted koncil which any relevant stories circulated as gospel between the not educated masses in that time.
But they removed equally so consciously more ten books from Bible as and to them referovated books that were approved.
Between reject items, we will find files how of apostles and of prophets.
Why would a God word have to refer us to books that are only and the words of any people / or longer they are not nor available?
Who here was a real editor?
Bible often mentions human authors.
How but would she be able to be approved thus if was God a real author of this random míchanice of reputations, podobenství and žalmový lyrika?
Bible completely was written definitely by people and certainly by not too enlightenments, rather versa.
This reason why a this is so much part of its contents is, historically and scientifically completely on wrong already is almost anything from start and to an end.
We speak people who believed that snakes and donkeys can talk they believed in spells, in blood victims, in a ritual magics, into enchanted objects, into fiery potions, into astrologie, and into five elements of the magic.
They thought if they will use the magic bar which they will spray someone by blood, it will cure it from leprosy.
We speak people who thought rabbits ruminants and bats are, birds and whales fish and pi that is whole integer are.
These people believed if, will show a pregnant cow striped patterns, they will bear striped calves.
How would this someone who knows something on genetics be able to say?
Authors of this book, it of course did not know.
If Bible was written by a higher being, she would not contain such mistakes then what he contains.
If she was from a pen of the actually superior being and if she was intended as literal then she would not contain at all anything of it he contains what.
It a moral guide totally fails by not ignorant and bigotní savages who ignored, or supported against a cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, abuse of children of the, violence on children, abortions, plenění, murder, kanibalismus, genocide and prejudices race, nation, religion, gender, and sexual orientation most of original Hebrew files was written.
To defend its not humanity a claim that they do God will.
But kreacionistas ignore these still all.
Some of their website sites admits if is any fact with Bible, the fact must be ignored then.
And why?
Because if kreacionistas did not have their beloved books, they would not have or God.
In their world, he is one and other same.
Is ironic they reject God " work " as the " worship of creation instead of a maker."
But it and God considers a word of a human for the word, it and even insists God on it that refutation of the their supposedly " Holy " books somehow contradicts god as such.
Not their version of God but the all versions of the god.
Kreacionistický christians think if Bible mistakes, God lies then.
They cannot accept that God would be able to exist and Bible simultaneously would be able to mistake because they will not fail to separate doctrine from deity.
This a type of modlářství, where believer reveres by the human of production compilation if as these books were it God because they think they are in its word.
But God never wrote, or did not dictate any of files of any religion.
All people approved what, or rejected of their allegedly " constant word " of any God being invented being made being grouped being translated, being interpreted, being modified, it, and often also intentionally being amended and being překrucovated by mere chybující people.

This well costs a piece from a church volume. Jiří.

We approached a jílovitý day, we came to a barrel ," said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it, they cleaned, and they found torzo of the assault German rifle which units, SS, used, it is.
A decision is allegedly not usual.
According to my information, such rifle made and to an end of a war.
And about three hundred of a thousand was of them ," Novák added.
All wooden structural things by a time spread therefore he is not applicable.
Her body is but well-preserved - he holds his shape.
How was it in studeň?
One explanation exists.
Maybe people who needed to rid weapons use by units, SS, to be not moved threw it there, probably from a fear.
Fascists on a run would not do it probably.
It dropped weapons in a forest, nálezce thinks."
Rifle it was only enthusiasts from a movement, Duha Jeseníks in studeň found what.
" There also hand grenades could be, around it tu was once everywhere many therefore we slowed výkopový works carefully we prohmatávated mud to do not happen an accident but nothing other there was down " Novák brought.

Ukrainian General: of captive Czech, I did not liberate yet.
An exclusive interview Aktuálně.cz with the generálplukovník Volodymyr Ruban which exempts ukrainian soldiers from captivity of proruský separatists.
Kiev / Praha " excuse, I must take this..., they call me from Doněcko ," ukrainian generálplukovník Volodymyr Ruban, also, of the otherwise Director it Center of osvobozování of war prisoners, apologized perhaps eight in the exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz.
The generálplukovník Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.
Any such interruption was not possible do not hear names of people their numbers or places, where they are -, or they would have to be which - Ruban specifies with its counterpart at an other end of phone.
" It will be - go there " he ended one of lightning discussions with Doněcko, and again he devoted this our.
Volodymyr Ruban is General in a reserve, a former pilot of a fighter and an active participant of the protivládní protests on Majdan.
- we domlouvated a conversation - he was only yesterday in Doněck.
Osvobozování of ukrainian soldiers from captivity of proruský separatists devotes twenty-four hours daily.
Currently. cz: you know perhaps, and Czeches fight on a part of proruský separatists.
Our kontrarozvědka estimates their number to thirty.
Of them he can be however and much more.
Already did you meet with any Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I liberated already captive serbs, Dagestánecs, Čečenecs, of one swede, Gruzínec..., but Czech yet not.
In Prague to turn who if we would run your captive countryman and it they could free but I know.
By an ukrainian soldier captive separatists.
A. cz: you advise what to Czeches who add to proruský separatists and the ukrainian soldiers will capture them?
They would have to understand if as czeches fight in ukrainian battalion and of volunteers separatists will capture them so he is after a hearing without mercy, he will shoot as any other foreigner.
Separatists consider these men as lease mercenaries, and it according to them nothing other than a death will deserve nothing.
Example the but ukrainian soldiers if they will take a group of doněcký separatists, - and between them therefore also perhaps of the Czech -, they will put it so for bars, and they treat with it as a war prisoner.
This guy simply will survive.
An ukrainian party acts also in a war as the State.
A. cz: and what you already it managed saving of the ukrainian prisoners?
If this well I mean so in an exchange.
Some sources state that already it long passed hundred of men.
Long already, we stopped to count, we helped many people.
But we freed only them... before the war, they did not save if they will decide in battles to continue.
Saviour are in the war doctors, surgeons but us definitely not.
So it is.
And other and other grow an every day.
We will save the every day someone.
Sometimes, of one, sometimes four or five.
And must not go always the exchange.
Sometimes also mere human plea is enough to a release of prisoners.
A. cz: he proslýchats se for few months, you earned in proruský separatists a large authority and even and the trust... as in an ukrainian company.
How did you manage to build respect of both válčící parties?
A difficult question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me nickname " crazy general with steel balls."
It does not offend me.
And maybe it and describes essence of our work.
I received it a head of ukrainian officer corps this authority already before.
Never I will chytračit, I cheat, and I keep always a word.
What happens so, I act honestly, and, I tell truth.
Even and then it is to an ukrainian government or of it doněcký or luhanský very not pleasant.
If they torture and they do kill people.
So I tell them simply they torture them, and they kill.
And crimes it is.
Often I risk a life so even they captured me and in an exchange of prisoners a..., this job can mean end whenever for me... I must not return.
A. cz: many executions and torture of prisoners, do you know.
... (long pomlka)... resort the Ukrainians and separatists in interrogations to torture of prisoners.
Fortunately.
And executions?
It happens only on a doněcký side.
On this also that an ukrainian army will popravovat prisoners I do not have information.
Nor indications that the ukrainian army of something similar engages.
On a quantity of executions, we have an idea but of a number I cannot declare, and nor I do not want.
A. cz: describe me characters and motives of proruský separatists.
Officers are between them but and veterans from Afghanistan.
They try autonomy and perhaps and democracy in Doněck or Luhansk - they say it at least so.
Longer they want not to play games more with ukrainian oligarches.
Separatists have already of oligarches full teeth and are their implacable opponents - to a life and to a death.
How we say, they přejísted - of them only to throat.
People given the same dreams and desires incidentally clear also on Majdan.
And now I will zaspekulovat little: Russia supports separatists and West the conversely ukrainian State.
I consider one speculation for large and this other conversely for small.
It this my sentence, but hides a not smiřitelný contradiction.
How do A. cz: you one of the hardest leaders of proruský separatists Igor Bezler appear for example?
Always I cross a line of war queue, I'm without armed, and I show soldiers or armeds rozpřažený bare hands.
And always both parties those two hundred or three hundred of meters on a sight or in the optical sight have me.
Always well, I see those faces of people who at me head..., and they whenever can pull trigger of their weapons.
Trooper, experienced Colonel with German and ukrainian ancestors.
He considers a Russian officer but its family - mother - he lives on the Ukraine.
He believes the Ukraine would not have to exist.
And jestli so as the only small gubernie in large Russian Empire.
In any case this, he talks constantly, and he considers the Ukraine for kind incur misunderstanding.
Such State according to it would not have to exist or.
Also he is an implacable enemy of all ukrainian oligarches.
A. cz on: already we speak characters - you marked of your prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk in a discussion show of ukrainian television under the weak, bezradný and tired " leader " which would do best if quickly he would leave.
This three hundred of meters of walking, I will get always an at least five fear.
Why would I have to hide then with a view that Yatsenyuk is the very weak prime minister and that he damages our country?
A. cz: the share war in the Ukraine has according to you.
Perhaps you know the Ukrainians of Yatsenyuk přezdívat a " rabbit."
And the rabbit is not in eyes of the Ukrainians the animal from which the fear would go, or it would have in other respect and an authority.
Its behaviour directly replicates behavior of the rabbit.
Maybe a good economist is but as a prime minister does not have in a war the right to cry in Parliament, to beg it, to play with it of its intrigue to threaten that will put a function... it must run a country to manage it and in a time of the war and to protect.
In a threat of the country, the prime minister does not have a claim to a family, friends, rest to plačtivý emotions.
It is yet first of ministers, Ukraine.
And Yatsenyuk?
Such a pubertální girl acts.
Yes, he is tired but also weak because he was never strong... he does not fight for the Ukraine, constantly he complains to all.
Therefore he would have to leave.
What sooner, that for the Ukraine better.

After a goal, a mainly missile called closely three minutes before an end the place in a network, but she finished on brankář of Opava to Josef Květoň.
I had it on a foot I must give such chances.
It " I poured angry Vašíček an ash to a head.
" I had to give it maybe higher under lid, little me it went " he wondered.
Defenzíva of Sigma, this Opava much did not allow Mikula's raid of a 11. minute was an exception, which, but gólman Reichl covered.
Then already Hanáks started to push, into the chances, he is but in a block defend domestic did not hold, and missiles from a distance Květoň caught.

Al Pacino twice inspired Venices.
Film Festival otherwise experiences a crisis.
Which after huge enthusiasm over an initial movie Birdman director Alejandro González Iňárritu included by impact between serious candidates for Golden Lion, suggested next days an impression that an interest a 71. year of the festival in Venices somewhat abated.
Already therefore a number of the seats in the greatest hall that after Birdman, followed reviews, recognise but for spectators less attractive images as a document, genocide in Indonesia, 60. years, by glance silences and other films with a social theme from American 99 homes for iranian stories, the empty seats remained simply in cinema increased to fourteen hundred or therefore.
Heroes from comics.
Even the or red carpet before festivalový palace such crowds in past and allegedly ceased to be a problem to get for the last notice the place in a hotel did not obléhat yet.
On a crisis, he talks in Italy more elsewhere and is not of a wonder she suffered also so respectable institutions as Biennale and like the oldest film festival in a world.
Fortunately the crisis does not show, by lack of personalities, present but exclusively to movies.
While younger fans wanted autographs of representatives of komiksový superhrdina, Michael Shannon and Andrew of Garfield, who zhostited se successfully quite in 99 homes of dramatic roles for all generations without a distinction, a visit of a legendary actor, Al Pacino, became a major event.
He shined it moreover right in the two movies.
In a story prozření present outside the competition which oscarový Barry Levison made according to a novel, Philip Roth, čtyřiasedmdesátiletý Pacino has the role which is to it close: of the actor on a top of glory who suffers depressions from an end of a career and a personal life.
But seeing it, right next day, as podivínský owner of železářství from the rural town in the movie Manglehorn which David Gordon Green it a really nezapomenutelný experience was made.
For the of Volpi Cup best Actor performance would not have to miss it -, but, an artist of Pacina's stature has still need of prices.
Maybe he is for it the largest satisfakce, of a love audience and it italian especially, and although he bore in New York, Al Pacino reports proudly to the country from which its grandparents originate.
Points for Italos.
Indeed a just italian film year does in Venices very well.

Chamber psychothriller took also the hungry hearts which filmed Saverio, Costanza with Alba Rohrwacherová, in a role of a woman who by his scestný úzkostlivost he will kill an own child almost.

" A decision changes would not have to make current management moreover of the city which mandate ends for few weeks " said councillor Lukáš Manhart Top 09).
To cancel plošně the gambling on its territory, immediately several of halls for example of Prague 5 and 7 decided in recent weeks.
Gamblings but will not disappear, decree gambling will not change yet.
It is a task of new management, city after elections.

He placed the last week a victory to proponents of a scottish not dependence reach of a hand.
A campaign for the scottish not dependence was in a danger he will make this error napotřetí almost she placed to billboards after all Scotland a question whether scots want to be rich.
But you will not get it to hearts of scottish voters you will appeal to their wallet or you will not získat si their respect when you will start to threaten them.
Morale of a New law is in Scotland still alive and only few scots still go and now to a church.
Scots have a much more tendency to drive směnárníks from a temple to let from them to dictate how they have to vote.
Chief of scottish nationalists Alex Salmond well knows this, and therefore in a television discussion, he inquired his opponent repeatedly, unionistický Darling whether he is willing to respect " sovereign will of scottish people " if scottish voters would vote for not dependence and to start to support a single currency for Scotland and England.
It forced Darling to choose between a scottish civil society and London financiers and with grimace to fall into this trap.
Of course darling will not support mandate of scottish voters.
But it discussion on this what Scotland will have the currency already she was neutralized less.
Really he motivates what scottish voters férovost, job opportunities and defense of a state health which has citizen free are.
Darling in a matter of a currency supported London bankers, and caused also an impression he will not object against privatisation of the health.
This how said Salmond it ," he climbed into a bed with conservatives."
This a very dangerous position is for an each Scottish politician.
An each scottish voter knows that scottish businessmen are with the in the bed conservatives.
David Cameron who in Scotland spoke to the not voters but confirmed this to an association of " bosses " to Confederation of a british industry.
Him it to be clear Cameron's refusal to debate on a not dependence with scottish prime minister Salmondem it was for a unionistický campaign a serious mistake.
Cameron so looks as cowardly absentující domestic.
Scots would respect it if he came to a debate with a scottish prime minister.
Cameron at least managed saying that Scotland can be a " successful independent country."
Alistair Darling will not fail anything such saying, it causes to it almost a physical pain.
, It he communicates what he is clear: scots have not to jump, and they must accept it what is.
He has the longest year 10 months.
Pessimistic start of a school according to Miloš, URBAN.
An illustration to a story the longest year.

Putin asks Kiev with the Eastern Ukraine to open a negotiation on a „ state sovereignty “.
According to a description of events, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked Russian newspapers into Sunday the ukrainian government to stopped battles with the separatists on east of a country and immediately to start the negotiations on the „ state sovereignty of “odtržený areas.
Its spokesman Dmitriy Peskov later explained that Putin his remark in intention had not to imply the areas of the eastern Ukraine under a control of separatists become a part of Russia but, their status within the Ukraine would have to be rethought russians to get the russian-speaking area an authority to protect of their rights and interests.
Putin's call to a kyjevský government a to deal with proruský insurgents equal odpovídats se an apparent strategy according to that he governs from outbreak of riots ago five months: help separatists, occupying a territory and force to grant the ukrainian government to newly declare Novorusk a factual not dependence a place with West to could contact with Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of State tv Putin, he condemned the ukrainian military actions which again have to regain eastern areas of the Doněcko and the Luhansk which in March and April separatists dominated then after Moscow, 18. March, anektovated krymský Peninsula belong to the Ukraine.
Separatists recently marked and Kremlin the occupied territory as „ Novorusko “or „ New Russia “the term which refer to famous předrevoluční days of Russian Empire.
A Russian press agency, Itar-Tass, published of Putin's word according to which anyone who believes that on a horizon, are peace negotiations because ukrainian politicians initiated before parliamentary elections 26. October of a campaign while government units challenge the civilian population in areas control by separatists a „ prisoner of illusions “is.
On not only legal matters, also a political organisation of a company and status of a state sovereignty of southeast, Ukraine, he said „ we must in an interest of people live in these areas immediately to initiate meaningful negotiations and it but “.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to the state sovereignty was thought in a context of the wider autonomy which with management, Kiev, this is already several months, and which has to alleviate concerns of the Russian -speaking areas from a threat of cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that a necessary autonomy to eastern areas, can give an only ukrainian government.
This is not a matter to a discussion between the Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov because „ this is not a conflict between Russia and the Ukraine but the internal ukrainian conflict “.
Zakročení of Speaker of the Kremlin which had to correct a „ wrong interpretation of “Putin's remarks stressed access of management, Russia, to a solution of the uprising of separatists in the East which is different from an open occupation of Krym, majority of a dvoumilionový population by an origin řadits se where to ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to anektovat much more difficulties, and Doněck and Luhansk on East of the Ukraine where most of 6.5 million an inhabitant is not, Russians and surveys public poll that conducted even before a conflict they showed wide support of the stay in the Ukraine.
, Autonomy which Russian diplomats discussed on international fora to the regional governments on the Ukraine would give a power to determine its own trade agreements and international relations and essentially giving to Kremlin an effective control so over a territory that would link a Russian land with Krym.
A Black peninsula anektovaný ago five months is a seat of main Russian maritime fleet of a maritime business background and historical coastal departments.
Areas between Russia Rostov and Krym are also Centre of mines, factories and foundries that produce important komponents for a Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko during his inaugurační speech of 7. June suggested that ukrainian legislators which after - new elections - considered the changes in Constitution would give diverse regions more a control over their finances and language status.
This vision of autonomy but considerably different from the vision of Kremlin and separatists. Moscow is accused of vyzbrojování and incitement of violence.
Putin's last call Kiev to act with separatists by equal, she followed an another procedure of rebels the last week then after to the eastern Ukraine, penetrated Russian units and tanks from a more previously quiet area along azovský Sea.
Separatists being reinforced by Russians, they took the control over Novoazovsk by such force that ukrainian security authorities fear him this is on a campaign with an objective to occupy a strategic coastal territory when to Krym.
This hastened a huge civilian and military effort to opevnit Mariupol, a port with metallurgical kombináts for 500 000, populations that lie between Novoazovskem and narrow entry gateway to krymský Peninsula.
Poroshenko into Saturday spoke on meetink of the frontal leaders of the European Union in Brussels, and he encouraged to an action that would prevent an another Russian aggression against the to the Ukraine, former soviet republic which last 23 years is independent.
To the from which „ we approaching point is not of a return “, Poroshenko warned.
On a territory of the Ukraine, he is thousands now of foreign military units and hundred of foreign tanks.
Summit, EU, did not take, no definite steps - leaders invite to accept other sanctions against Russia of closer not specified escalation of an ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman of ukrainian National Security and defence Council into the Saturday reporters in Kiev said that ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajskus then after the last week two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1 000 of military units, it entered into a doněcký area to support obléhaný separatists.
