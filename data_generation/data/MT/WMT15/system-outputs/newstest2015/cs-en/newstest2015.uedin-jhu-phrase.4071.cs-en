This is a question that I thought that I had never concern.
But in football, anything is possible.

Restoration of the very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Kongresmeni Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law which is organizing a union to protect as a civil law.
"Depending on how they operate the unions are working jobs for the middle class," says Ellison, a Democratic senator for Minnesota, which is chaired Congressional committee.
Therefore, I am so proud that I can, together with the model of the occasional rights of John Lewis to introduce a law to enhance the position of employees.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for how to prevent discrimination in organizing a union, as with other forms of discrimination - and stop protiodborové forces
Adjust the law on labour relations so as to allow all employees who face discrimination if they wish to engage in the trade unions, the judge in the civil courts - and recovered damages or compensation - is correct and necessary initiative.
But it certainly is not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other plaintiffs in the present, is re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the labor fight, which took place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - the Americans once supported the country in the world to adopt, expand and respect the rights of employment.
There was a time, and millions of Americans are still remember when the country in one breath to promote democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and his advisers encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy Hideki Toja will be replaced by a democracy.
They were convinced that the employees and their unions play a role in the formation of the new Japan, included in their language and openly acknowledged that "the right of employees to collect, collective bargaining and action is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, Gen. Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged Germans to create a constitution that ensures that Adolf Hitler's fascism will be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans were aware that employees will be in the new nation need to organize and promote and therefore have included a clause that openly says: "The right to create alliances to ensure and improve employment and economic conditions will be every individual and every occupation or profession guaranteed.
The arrangement, which will restrict this right or will seek his damage will be abolished. Measures to meet such a purpose are illegal.
When the former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chaired by the International Commission on Human Rights, which has proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, included the plaintiffs and Roosevelt guarantee that "everyone has the right under the protection of their interests and to join trade unions to create."
A whole generation of Americans accept the basic premise that the labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to create labor unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with the companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organise in a free and open society and to promote.
As fifty years ago, said the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.:
The history is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the strength of the nation's unions increased and expanded it.
Raise the living standards of millions of people, has created a market for the industry and the production rose to previously unimaginable levels.
Those who are attacking the unions, these simple truths they forget history, but remembers.
Mindful of the history and we should, too.
The formal recognition of the labour rights as human - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in organizing unions - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renewing the ideals that have lifted America and make a real commitment to democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the Louisiana law, which, according to lawyers probably closed all five clinics performing abortions in the state.
The regulation enacted by signing louisianského Governor Bobby Jindala in June, which is to enter into force on 1 September, after doctors performing abortions would be required to have the right to adopt a patient in a hospital within 30 miles away from the performance of their experience.
The resolution means that doctors may temporarily continue in the implementation of legal abortions and, in the meantime, you must get this authorisation.
"The requesting party will be able to operate legally and in the meantime he obtains permission," says the resolution of the federal judge John deGravellese.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month, so that the judge could issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Abortion rights activists on the resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said it will give doctors more time to obtain a permit.
"Today's decision ensures women in Louisiana, that they will be safe from vicious law, which is to prepare for the health and their rights," said Nancy Northupová, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which the lawsuit on behalf of three of the five clinics sought blocking the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision relates to the doctors of the two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs, and also apply to grant the permit.
Louisiana is among the 11 states that have approved similar laws and courts in Alabama and Mississippi declared unconstitutional provision of such measures.
The key parts of the Texas law that would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state blocked a federal judge on Friday.
Campaigners for women's rights to abortion, together with the Association of American obstetricians and gynecologists and the American Medical Association says that the need to have this permit puts the doctor requirements that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion oppose the measures are intended to protect the health of women, and some also welcomed the fact that, because of the measure would have been closed clinic.
The Centre for Reproductive Rights argued that in Louisiana has allowed only one doctor performing abortions.
If all the doctors in the state were forced to stop with the implementation of abortion, the doctor would be out of fear for his safety also stopped to perform surgery, the group said.
In response, Louisiana authorities have indicated that they would sanction doctors who perform abortions, while pending applications for the granting of rights.
Because of the late diagnosis and limited access to treatment for ovarian cancer kills more often in the countryside
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released the video with a tribute to his late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in the Australian outback, there is an increased risk of death from ovarian cancer, than their counterparts in the city.
The researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1100 Australanek diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of living five years after diagnosis.
Research manager Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for women in rural and remote areas of the state was about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
A STUDY: New drugs can slow the lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers followed women during the seven years of treatment.
Dr Jordan said that the chances of survival influenced women's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in older women who have been diagnosed with cancer in a more advanced stage.
For women in rural and remote areas of the state was about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why the women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says that the factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease can best be treated gynekoonkologové, who usually located in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of medical services at a distance to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, Dr. suggested that would help strengthen the transportation services that will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are treated far from his family and friends.
Dr Jordan said that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer regardless of geographical location is low, which highlights the need for better treatment and prevention programmes.
The research funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer today publish the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, was in his 33 years young mother Elisha Neaveová from the town of Gold Coast diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.

Like other factors threatening the industry, which earns an estimated five billion pounds a year, says the increase in the number of people living in urban areas, where there are gardens, the popularity of the pavement instead of the front used as a parking area and shrinking the size of the gardens.
In the area of Greater London, where the share-owned homes fell during the six years from 61% to 43%, the lowest per household expenditure on horticultural products in Britain.

When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin at the reunion of his youth organisations, which reminds me most of all, Hitler Youth, rattled the atomic weapons and virtually all indicate that their views are stolen from him, gave us a lecture on democracy.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia has many of the features of the fascist state.
The big nations have one thing in common, and that is that it can take over as intense nationalism and the inferiority complex that can transform the imperialistic.
Time passes to the east apparently differently than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the war for dominance over Europe is long gone, in the east, on the contrary, he thinks that they were overlooked for a long time, and it is necessary to win back its international position.
Such a mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the power grab by the Nazis and then followed an explosion of nationalism unlike today's situation in Russia.
And then the quite the same cult of a strong leader, beating up journalists, the liquidation of troublesome political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, it is indeed quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of the Russians will probably miss the time when Russia was half of the world and the second part is shaking before them.
I think it was their own fault Western politicians, perhaps little Vladimir out, maybe they didn't ask him where he wanted to, and maybe they underestimated him and he just acted like a typical Russian muzhik.
He made a house in order, he was that he didn't really go anywhere and sharpening his knives at home.
Now he decided to reclaim lost positions.
Start slowly, he has time.
The leader is probably for life, so where would be hurried.
Trample Kavkazany, now would trample the Ukrainians, then they are on a number of dwarfs from the Baltic region.
They bite in the Russian bear fur long enough.
It's certainly sees himself as well as China, which seem awfully jumps and certainly an eye on the Far East.
And you are bugging the Germans of Vladimir, too, as they are good and I gave them in the 45 to butt.
How about do one new Novorosiju in Karlovy Vary.
It would have been our základnička and there's a lot of oppressed and there is also a dacha, eluding some of them wanted to demolish.
I've been vzpomnají our veterans, as they were in Czechoslovakia.
Well here is that their Prime Minister gospodin Sobotka, he is so měký, it can be peeled like onions and eat the whole of the EU.
It would be played to the great Russia jumped.
It is necessary to remind them where their place.
And as the detonators we use our compatriots who live on their territory.
The Russians are everywhere, and when he says that there are oppressed, so there is simply oppressed and that we won't leave it, we can protect them.
And the Russian will govern again, but what else is born.
Europe is good only as a rug, which can be proud Ivan dance Kazatchok.

Schools in Gaza, however, remains closed while the territory is still recovering from the fighting.
The beginning of the school brought to communities in the south of Israel marred by attacks a sense of joy and excitement, but the signs of the fighting are still evident.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the employees of the nursery, which has hit a rocket, was removed from the wall of the fragments, and gradually await the return of the children.

Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and an estimated 250,000 people had hidden in a hundred schools of the United Nations, which has been transformed into a makeshift shelter.
Because of the tens of thousands of people who are still in shelters, and because of the ongoing fighting školští officials last week postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope that the school will open soon, so that we can finish the education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from a school in the largest city of Gaza.

Lenny Henry: My father never put his arm around me.
He never told me, "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands.
With his father, who died when he was 19, and who worked in a factory, had a cooler relationship.

He knew very little about him.
You've never seen his face, you just heard his voice: "Stop that racket.
Let your sister in the room.
Move!.
I want to look at the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, were grown up - with him went to the bar and discussing things like the shape of a glass of beer or beauty strike in cricket.
I've never talked to him.
For most of my life, it was a serious guy in the corner, reading the newspaper.
Henry recently visited a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than in my father's time, looked into what life must have been for him.
Now there is a little more light, but it's still a dark, smoky, grim labyrinth where flames explode and there is a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always got into the bath and just lay there, then slowly begins to sing for myself, because the foundry washes away from him.
When I walked around, I realized that this year was doing to support my family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Even though Henry spent childhood without parental love.
My dad did not hug anybody, said, "I love you."
When my mother was sick and dying, we started to say "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter, Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love that he lacked as a child.
You can stop with the "I love you"?
Still don't hug me!
Daddy, I'm 22!
The Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a great mom
With the French, to whom he was married for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn is good.
Why should we not be friends with Dawn?
It's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a very, very great overweight and began to show symptoms of diabetes, the doctor said to me: "You have to make a radical change."
So I started to walk into a large fitness centre and I had to keep a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And tedious.
No one wants to eat the carrot.
The change in the direction of closing Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, close-cropped beard.

DJ spotted him on the podium, as someone is, and wrote about it in the New Faces talent competition.
His TV career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time, I was the only black imitator / comedian on TV."
He learned on the march.
In addition to the public must have spotted me, I must also between 1975 and 1985 to learn how to invent a joke, to be a star and appear on TV and it was really hard.
Lenny the New Faces in 1975
Given that his manager had owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White minstrel Show, the entertainment programme, in which the actors as blacks, Henry in his comedy finally acted for five years.
My family was already uneasy because of it.
Some wish it had never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and awkward position, I worked on the big stage and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was the "years and years at the main product of British television," but it was also "a grotesque parody of blacks."
In the 1980s, Henry worked in the alternative comedy circles and presented the figures at the same time ridiculing the celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began to broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was also known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in a comedy seriále Chef!.
It took almost another decade of advertising, documents, operas and roles in movies, but after the airing of the series on the BBC LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he said: "So what are you going to do now, Len, a little bit because you're stuck in one place, or see a bit out of the way."
Next up was a documentary on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...? / What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
In school, we really taught him and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone with whom we were doing in the interview, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said: "You should try it."
Don't knock it, if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we are all so fond of Shakespeare.
Henry for the document presented by twenty rows of Othellovy final speech, and he was in on it.
It gave me a feeling that I can do it.
As if it gave me the courage.
"It's about it; it is a serious matter, take it seriously, learn to text, something you find out about it.
So the testing was hard and I read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
It seemed to have trouble, which did not happen.
Soon he began to play in a comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre. "I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought: "You've changed."
There was a technical defect, and Henry instinctively felt that they must take responsibility for the seizure of the audience.
"The voice in my head told me:" Computers, you have to talk is now ten minutes. ""
Instead, the theatre director announced that the show will continue when the problem is resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said: "Oh, thank God."
It is not my responsibility.
Can solve it for me by someone else.
"You play, you stay in the role."
Henry in the fences at the Duchess Theatre
To learn the text of the fences was a challenge.
The panic is quite good, adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a divine sign that says: "You should do this."
Of course, it says in a loud voice.
So I'm staying there.
I really like it.
I'm glad in the rehearsal room.
Henry still remains the brain buffoon - throughout our conversation interrupts humornými performances, which enters and leaves the role of the actor.
I decided not to do stand-upy because they have the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I would say.
When you're looking for something, you can get into a blind alley.
Sometimes, when I want, I'm Live at the Apollo, but it's not like before.
I asked if he ever will organise a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in the same room with the director, which helps keep the contours of the beginning, middle and end of the road - I don't think I ever wanted to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
Acting amuses me.
It is fun.
Still tell stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers state officials to shed some light on the non-existent employees
Kenya started with a biometric registration of all its officials to try to remove the government's non-existent employees from the payroll.
According to a statement by the government to stop employees who don't register in the next two weeks, to receive payment.
The government believes that thousands of people receive a salary, even after leaving government service.
After they took office in 2013, has promised President Uhuru Kenyatta to prevent corruption in public administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state comes a month of at least one million dollars (£700 000) to the payment of non-existent employees and other misconduct.
The government has a suspicion that salaries are still being sent to bank accounts, even after the death of a staff member or after the employee leaves the administration, said the BBC reporter from the capital Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All public officials must appear in the next two weeks to the identification centres, where their data will be recorded biometricky, says in a statement of government.
Furthermore, says that anyone who is not without sufficient justification, will be excluded from the payroll.
"By identifying the actual public service employees, this measure will contribute significantly to rationalise and also will be used to unclog the payroll at both levels of government, and thus will solve the problem of ghost employees," said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested because of a "conspiracy" against the government
Local media reported that in Turkey were detained on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," a total of 33 policemen.
Meanwhile, the police department did not comment on the case.
According to the Hurriyet (News was among the detainees two high-ranking officials.

Not all of the children returned to school in Ukraine
Most of the schools in Ukraine, on Monday (September 1) reopened after the summer holidays.
This is an important day for the traditional family, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents and Prime Minister Arsenij sign took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, journalists reported that not all schools are open again, but he is determined to defend the country for the next generation:

Not the whole of Ukraine is peace.
We need to fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavjansku, which attends Jaceňukova daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will be finally achieved peace and that the children will gain the knowledge that they will be useful in the future.

In the BBC Roně Fairheadové may have found the supervisor for hard times
Carries with him the clouds of glory from the world of banking, media management and internal conclave of the Conservative Party.
She has experience from the front lines.
Career began in the consultancy firm Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearsons into the media world.
For seven years, was the executive director of the Financial Times. The office resigned as the highest office in the parent company Pearson's took her younger colleague.
It is said that her severance came close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also widespread.
David Cameron was advised Lord Browne, the former director of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed private expertise: She became an advisor of the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the work of the director as a chalice of poison.
Not only that the BBC is extensive and complex entity in the centre of public life, but in its structure, there is also an internal paradox.
Corporations are turning in two directions: Inside on the top layer of the hierarchy of the leadership of the BBC, but also out on the voice of the public in times of unrest, when things are not working.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly, which calls for a thorough reform.
The director, but the risk that comes into the company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, disassemble it and prepare himself for the job.
It is a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see how the BBC is shrinking - its power, its finances - and how to revise its status.
As it expands the range of competition and new technology challenges the old certainties, the immediate negotiations on the BBC licence fees for the great danger.
For the modest sum 145,50 pounds a year, the British public buys stake in what is certainly the biggest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: Claims that its production reaches 96% of households, and each stands at just 40 pence a day.
Moreover, the BBC apparently rising popularity: 53% of supporters, compared to 31% ten years ago.
The use of the services of the BBC models have changed: Today's headlines appear on a mobile phone and the programmes that I missed, I can look at iPlayeru.
But the BBC remains very beloved and wonderful institutions.
Needs a wonderful director - I hope to find one.
Texas Governor Perry says that the offensive tweet did not approve
Tweet from the official account twitterového Texas governor Rick Perry, which was published on Sunday, contained the offensive picture of a Democratic state representative, who initiated the Perry criminal charges of abuse of power.

The label in tweetu said: "Not always driving with a blood alcohol level three times higher than the allowable limit... but when I do, so I'm suing Governor Perry that calls for accountability for it."
I am as drunk Democrat in Texas.
An investigation against Perry led the Lehmbergové.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, the special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was determined by a Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and the charges called tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the judge overseeing the case that rejected the charges, because the use of the law to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry said the payment of 7.5 million dollars of public funds for the defending the public interest, which is based in Travis County and prosecute corruption in Texas, after Lehmbergová refused to resign.
Rejection of a formal complaint of left-oriented group of civil society activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes even the map.

Extraordinary demonstration of the sixteenth -- Jacobson Howard lauded the new novel about love and the letter "J"
They melted, this is the best way to describe it, gradually spread as kartonová boxes and left in the rain.
Only a woman from time to time, he said that it is too serious, complex, violent, isolated and maybe a little irritable.
And then shook his hand.
He admitted irritably.
He could shoot up, like a hedgehog, yes.
The latest victim of this his ability was a love affair, which more than usually promised that it will ease the solitary life of boredom and maybe even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomonsová was fragile beauty with a wild mane of hair and a fickle heart from a village in the north of the island, which was even more remote and hostile than Port Reuben.
The south came up with an older companion, Kevern thought it was her aunt, who had inherited the property in the damp, but the beautiful valley called, appropriately, the Garden of the valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
They were leaking pipes, tanks were dead spiders, snails, oslizle signed at the window, as if they thought that this place belongs to them, the garden was overgrown with weeds like giant cabbages.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, frightening and charming, with a garden full of secrets.
The profile of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
Narrower selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on folding chairs in the long grass and holding hands, enjoyed an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuned in a public station that edge with comforting music and soothing news, when his eye on her tanned crossed legs reminded the old song long forgotten black comedian, which has drawn shades like listening to his father.
You're too big feet.
Because of their natural aggression has such songs played on radio.
There were banned - nothing was actually forbidden - simply did not play.
They helped them get to desuetuda, as well as the very word desuetudo.
The popular taste managed what would never fail to regulations and positions outside the law, and just as people in terms of books, collect memoirs, in which the poor will become rich, cooks and movie romances and music are selected ballads.
Kavern let himself down on the day and began to play on an imaginary piano and crude, comic voice sang serenade Aillininým big toe.
Ailinn understand.
"It was a favourite song from a jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said, and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
It was always his father, when he wanted to suppress the letter j before he comes out of his mouth.
It began as a game when he was a child.
The father told him that the game played with his father.
If you're in the words, what began to j, put two fingers in front of his mouth, it cost you a penny.
Even then it was very funny and witty, it was not even now.
But he knew that it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what it is jazz.
Ailinn never heard of.
Even the jazz, though not directly outlawed, played.
Improvisation went out of fashion.
In life there was only room for one of the "if."
When she began to play a tune, people wanted to know where it will end.
The same thing with humor.
His nepředvidatelnost went to people's nerves.
And the jazz was humor expressed songs.
Although up to ten years heard about Sammy Davis Junior, knew polotajné Kevern jazz from his father's collection of old CDs.
But at least Aillin didn't say that Fats Waller was black.
Owing to his age, he could not remember a time when popular singers were blacks.
Also, without laws or coercion.
Acquiescent society is one in which every part of her with gratitude - with the gratitude of those who were happy chance of saving - agrees with the principle of collective gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin, temperament and stature thrown for entertainment and athletics, and they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if nature gifted for electronics, took responsibility for the fact that there will be no family without a working phone.
The Poles who remained were plumbers, Greeks, who remained, washing dishes.
Those of the countries of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents quickly left the country, while it was happening, WHAT HAPPENED, IT HAPPENED - they were afraid that they would be charged that they put into the fire, fearing that the fire would spend the next time - they opened the restaurant where the labneh sold and smoked water pipes, a very low profile and inaction is slowly consuming.
Each according to his talent.
Given that only listened to ballads, Ailinn hard to understand how the expletives, who had just sang Kavern, could rise to the music.
The music was an expression of love.
"In fact, not stupid," said Kevern.
Perhaps only for people who have very big feet.
My father never offended anyone, but he liked this song.
He talked too much, but neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
From behind a soundproof sheets could escape the word.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father liked something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put himself in the presence of two fingers to his lips.
He thought that was weird.
"It seemed funny," he said finally.
She shook her head in disbelief and eclipsed the Kevernovi.
In the whole wide world there was nothing more than a jumble of her jet-black hair.
Nothing else did not want to see.
"If you think," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you sing it.
She looked really upset.
I have very big feet?
Looked again.
The feet so completely.
Maybe a little ankles...
You say you hate me, because I am very thick ankles?
I hate?
It is not true.
It's just a silly song.
She was able to say "I love you," but it was too early.
"Your fat ankles just attracted to me," he said.
I'm a little sick.
It wrong.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the necessary to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Maybe his father was deliberately cruel.
Maybe he was intentionally cruel Kavern.
Despite the gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomonsová reddened and rose from the couch, knocking the radio and spilled the unfinished wine.
Elderberry wine, so it could not drink.
She seemed to be shaking in their excitement as the palm fronds in the storm.
"Perversely attracts me, that you're an idiot," she said.
Except that it doesn't attract me.
He was sorry for her, as for his unkind words, so because of the fear in her eyes when he stood up against him.
She thought that hit her?
Didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that the foundations that there was the same as here.
It broke on the same wide and the Arctic Ocean.
The same confusion of the men, then, WHAT HAPPENED, even touchier and grumpier than their ancestors, smugglers and kazisvěti, angrily wandered from pub to pub, ready to reach out to any woman who would dare to reject them or to laugh at them.
Moron?.
If he is not careful, she will perform his fist.
Her first hug -- hug has become the most common expression for erotic stimulation between a man and a woman: An antibody dim ballads about love, which she sprayed radio - her first, then hit her one.
According to Kevernova view too much sophistication, because petting was in itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomonsová nonverbally suggested him to leave.
Up from the couch as an old man.
She felt upset, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
Almost unknown.
She watched him go - as if he was watching from the window in the floor - the man who drove what caused himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart sank for him and for all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them zbilo her.
The man turned away from her, shoulders hunched, embarrassed, defeated, there was no fight left him - why she felt that it knows well, though she couldn't recall a single moment, until today, that it has ever seen?
Ailinn Solomonsová, alone again, looked at his feet.
Twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaumová, intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, nestatutárním monitoring system, the public mood, has prepared a brief article about the persistence of light and medium-heavy violent acts in the areas of the country where the reduction or suspension, as expected, had at his disposal there have been plenty of money and energy.
"A lot has been done, and she still has a lot to do," she wrote, "to calm down an innate aggressiveness of people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in something, hard-to-reach parts of the country, where, despite the church towers above the hedges tinge of human kindness historically cropped up only rarely."
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It would appear that the higher the steeple, the lower the instincts.
The inhabitants of the sentimental baladami whimper, devouring the unfortunate stories and declare that firmly believes in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that, in the areas of the old brutality rurálních holds as doggedly as in urban areas, but the evidence also shows that at home, in the workplace, roads and even on the sports ground emerges a new and aggressive intolerance.
"Unfortunately, you have a tendency to overly květnatému style," said her boss.
I would suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaumová bowed her head.
Also, I have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I have the impression that I don't have to answer for it," said Esme Nussbaumová.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme was again said his right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Another silence.
"I don't ask why," Rabinowitz said finally, "that I have anything against ateistům, lesbians or female,.
We don't have in this workplace prejudices.
We serve the unbiased.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which itself is perfectly acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment as you have demonstrated that you.
Obviously you're prejudiced against the Church - the things that you call the "cruel" and "brutal" others would also interpret as an expression of the natural strength and energy.
Still resolve WHAT HAPPENED, IT HAPPENED as if it happened, if it happened, yesterday, preparing the ground with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaumová looked around.
For his head on the screen flickered pink recommendations that Ofnow poured into the world of the last quarter-century or more.
Smile at the neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to songs, go to musicals, use your phone, konverzujte, explain, discuss it, apologize.
It is better to talk than to remain silent, sung by the word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand your concerns," she said quietly Esme Nussbaumová when she was sure that her boss was finished, "and now I'm not saying that the wound healed as they pretend that healed.
My first concern is that if we don't alerted in advance of it, we will repeat the same mistake that led to WHAT HAPPENED, IT HAPPENED.
This time, but we will not vent anger and mistrust on the other.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips.
It was a sign of infinite patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when the steps that might have done, and maybe do your grandparents, you describe as a mistake.
It's gone too far and that you're talking about the fact that they vented their "anger" and "disbelief" at the "other."
I didn't have someone in your position to remind you that in the understanding of the past, and in the protection of the presence of not talking about "us" and "them."
There was no "us" and there were no "them."
All we know is that it was a chaotic times.
"During which, if we're honest with each other," Esme took courage, "no one we are not blameless.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened, happened.
It was before.
This is not what to say - we agree on this.
And just as there is no fault, which could be to blame someone, there are even things that should be remedied, even if the correction was appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past, than to draw lessons from it -
The past is there, we forgot it.
If I can add something to -
Luther Rabinowitz unclenched his fingertips.
"Your message will take into account," he said, dismissing her.
To this day, when she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist, who ran onto the pavement in a way that passersby have described as a "brutal and savage."
Accidents happen.
The army of Lesotho says that no coup plans - Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of Lesotho have denied that they were organizing a coup to overthrow the government, and says that they acted against the police suspected of attempted armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says that the army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital city of Maseru.
Having said that death threats, the Prime Minister went with his family to the neighboring South Africa.
Military spokesman Maj. Ntlele Ntoi says that, in fact, it was not a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" who are trying to equip the police.
"This morning, the command of the defence forces of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after several reports received information services that, in the ranks of the police found several groups that are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were going to cause havoc in the country," he told the Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has said that the government had seized power by force, seems to bear the action lesothských defenses of the coup," he said.
Military leaders of Lesotho said that the soldiers had returned to their barracks on Sunday and in the capital was calm.
During the Thabanovy absence will be responsible for the government of Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing.
Thabane said that in his view, is the target of the attack because of their efforts to combat corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended the session of parliament due to internal divisions, there is tension in Lesotho.
He said that despite the opposite argument, the government does not undermine his actions.
Production in the euro area is at třináctiměsíčním lows
The growth of production, according to the survey closely in August in the euro zone slowed to 13-month minimum.
The final purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the euro area from 51.8 in June fell to 50.7 in August.
The number higher than 50 indicates expansion.
The dearth of new orders and damaged the growing tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
The markets from the banks will want a clear plan on how to deal with the eurozone oddalovaným ozdravením even with the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
There was speculation that the director of the ECB, Mario Draghi, perhaps this week suggested that the eurozone is considering quantitative easing, similar to what joined during the financial crisis, the United Kingdom and the United States.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, braking effect, which has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the manufacturer, it is becoming increasingly apparent," said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
Germany's manufacturing PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the minimum jedenáctiměsíční 51,4.
The second largest economy in the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy switched back from the expansion of this stagnation.
Signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands also disappeared, too, is not very reassuring, "Dobson said.
The slowdown is likely to add fuel to the fire industry analysts waiting implementation of further monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that could be on the manufacturing purchasing managers survey for August to say is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: Manufacturers in the euro area are currently life very complicated, because of rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between Russia and Ukraine - adds to the increasingly difficult conditions in many countries even more uncertainty.
The increasing uncertainty trade demonstrably struck - especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders will be delayed or even cancelled, especially those expensive.
Said that as a "more likely" appears to be that the ECB will eventually have to make some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect that it will be limited."

Ten years ago, the Chechen militants at a school in Beslan in southern Russia, thousands of people have been detained as hostages
During the ordeal, which lasted three days and that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children
We returned to Beslan to seek some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities in school
Exactly 10 years after the disastrous occupation of the school in Beslan in which 334 people died, including 186 children, warned last night the surviving heroes before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As of September 1, 2004, at the start of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and killed the children and parents, it looked like the bottom of the deepest hell.
Resentment over the tragedy has joined the east and west, which in this catastrophic disaster led to negotiations and the future.
After ten years, we were in Beslan in southern Russia returned to seek some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities in school.
We found a wonderful young people who braved the disaster, although the memory of the misery caused by the terrorists will continue to live in them.
What is their greatest desire?
That war, which is now destroying Ukraine - and in which the children as they were dying - is over.
The girl trying to climb back into the ruined school gymnasium
It was intercepted by leading Russian photographer Dmitri Beliakovem, only in their underwear trying to climb back into the school gymnasium rozbombardované after the bomb exploded in it.
Confused Aida Larissu desperately looking for her mother, who is now forty.
There were fears that the two are dead, but in fact survived.
"A woman told me to run and I'll save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
I had the legs from the blood.
I got up and went back to find his mother.
He saved a soldier.
After several operations thought that he had fully recovered, but yesterday, she said: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid that I will have to another operation.
I remained the pieces of shrapnel in his knee.
Its aim is to become a dentist to help people as doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but certainly did not destroy him," she said firmly.
"It just happened to me and it can be changed.
Once a year I go to the gym to remind those who remained there.
Otherwise, we are trying not to talk about it with friends.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and classmate of the future class Džeru Gapoevu killed there.
As a small, we played together and we were, how do we go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I don't finish school and career.
I'll be thinking about the family later.
He says he forgot in captivity, but the memories are fading slightly each year.
I am pleased that so many people around the world still remembers what happened, and we are very grateful for the assistance that we received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at your picture on the Internet, as I'm getting the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, he understands the disaster and prevent a repeat.
The boy, who escaped the rain of bullets and believed that his mother is dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, children are starting school in seven years) and survived a three-day siege of a school in the arms of his mother, Tamara.
At that time, the seven-year-old said: "My mum told me that if there was an explosion, I have to lie on the ground and hold her hand."
After the explosion thought that the mother is dying.
He said: "Run."
He was afraid that he is dead, and the way he saw a crying toddler, he grabbed the child by the hand and ran a spray of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who caught him out, he said: "Damir told me that his mother is dead."
He says: "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara she stumbled to freedom and lay in a hospital with a bad leg, and thought that her son had died.
After they met again, she said: "I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
Ran inside and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct newspaper the News of the World), where he was then prime minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie declared the winner Bernardo's Children.
"The horror is returning every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are fading anymore.
I remember right after I threw away all your pistols to play.
But today I can play computer games in which to shoot, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about yourself.
I remember the children with whom I played out in the yard, and which are not.
Never say that he is killed or died.
We say that remained in the gym.
On a trip to London, I remember very well, especially on how I am in a toy store could choose whatever I wanted, and as I drove the convertible.
But now worried about places like Ukraine, which is suffering because of the war, as well as he and his friends suffered.
The horror is returning every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
"I'm terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through this kind of horror," says Damir, who last week attended voluntary work in the monastery.
I want very much to help.
Once, I want to work with the police and I hope that next year will take me to the academy.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: "They killed 37 children in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence immediately after the attack, there were no children who would have screamed and ran, and the silence lasted several months.
He remembers vividly on the road with Damirem to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was thankful Cherie Blairové and its foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that, even if it was ten years ago, still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damirovi.
I remember Damir taste for borscht, and so they called all the Russian restaurant.
I also remember how he played in the restaurant, with waiters, Damir fired at them from a water pistol and they were running and playing with him.
And that was just a month from the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share with us our pain and how they supported us.
She said: "I still think that the world has changed in the last ten years for the better.
It is the war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think it was, and still is, a lot of children were killed.
These are the same as those of our children.
I think a lot of people for the war is just something in the news, which will hear when bored or while doing something else.
I know what these people are experiencing what kind of horror.
I feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it is so sad.
Damir grew up and it is a nice, quiet kid, is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, no desire for revenge, it doesn't bother him.
I know that you don't want to remember, but he's very close to the six classmates and occasionally goes to the gym and lit candles there.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember sometimes lay on the couch with the face away from us, and sometimes he lay there for hours.
Slept, his eyes were open.
I also remember that threw all their guns or other weapons to play. Damirovi is now 17, is taller than me, handsome, clever and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I have a few hours she was sure he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and rose to his feet, I looked around and saw the hell, pieces of human bodies lay everywhere.
I was pretty sure that my little boy did not have a chance to survive this hell.
"I remember when I was screaming" Damire, run, run! ', but I was convinced that I heard.
But he heard it and ran away.
So our life is unlike any other.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose photo taken after the attack has become a symbol of the horrors in Beslan
Consolation: Survivors of the Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, Grigory right now
When he ran for his life after the Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, he was committed to his bloodied face fear.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocities in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a physician, he dropped his first day at school and hurried to take his older son Vladimir at the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the yard, so my little boy there three days alone," she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Survived only my Grigory.
As the date approaches, it is still difficult to think and talk about it.
Not a single day passes to nevzpomínali on the tragedy.
We don't find that it happened a long time ago, I have the feeling that it was yesterday, some moments I keep coming back.
I promise that no one will never forget.
The recurrent memories: Photo of Grigori (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and has been described as a statue (right)
I remember the day Grigory really looked forward to the school, said that he wants to hug his teacher.
He is alive, I learned when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino is even a statue of the grieving Grigori.
Grigory is looking at the picture reluctantly and at home we have hidden in her bookshelf.
I understand that, but I think that, thanks to the picture of people around the world know the pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: "It is important that this will not happen again.
"I don't think we will ever know the truth.
Similar tragedy is still under investigation, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.
We will sometimes, what was the cause?
This world is waiting for something very wrong.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, so no one wants war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such a pain.
To at least a little bit forgotten, he needs for decades.
It influence on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years, I had nightmares about the attack, but then it got better.
When I went back to school in 2004, every day, I was scared.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates, who killed.
Therefore, when approaching 1 September, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of childhood friends.
It is hard for me to enter into the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year, I finished school and began to study medicine at university in Vladikavkazu.
I want to be a cardiac surgeon.
At first I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of the health.
I wanted to fight for their country, but it won't work.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
The boy, who survived, though he was kept at the foot of a homicidal terrorists
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held during the attack at the foot of a homicidal terrorists, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, was imprisoned in the gym, sitting beside the bombs at the foot of a homicidal terrorists.
It's a real miracle that he survived.
"It seemed as if it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injuries suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I threw behind his head.
Now I am older and it is said that children are better able to deal with bad experiences - I have to say that this is not true.
"In 2006, I went to a psychologist and then I was a little better, but I can't forget.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I went to the gym again.
I blacked out.
There's never going again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting on the well-known image.
Survivors: Gregori Farniev today, on a laptop with his photographs ever taken in a hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I hate to think about it or talk and never asked me to school.
In terms of physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful about my knee, which was injured, but they do not.
But even so, I couldn't go to work because of the health and study at the FSS Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted to.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports and responded to me that it is not possible.
My other hobby are animals, so I went to the vet school.
I just finished the second year.
They learn how to treat all animals from the 'cats after the cows. "
He said: "I know that their children will never talk about it.
It is not something that children should know and not something that should have.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "The pain will still be here.
It is inside and getting worse with the approaching anniversary.
I will attend připomínkových ceremony.
I know that Grigory won't work.
It must be even stronger for him, because there was unlike me.
I am waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that I was back here in Beslan tracks are everywhere.
It remains with us.
Gregory is an adult, but the horror he carries on.
It is hard to accept when you become something so terribly unfair.
It's a boy, loves the sport, but he cannot do it because of his knee.
He underwent several operations, he can walk, but he cannot exercise.
I would say that all of the 50% of the terror overcame anymore, but to overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will still be with us.
During the attack they killed a lot of our friends and neighbors, and it only exacerbates the pain.
I've lost a lot of people that I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift God could give me, but the loss hurts.
I know the family, in which the other children, but also the widows, who are already married again.
It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want.
I will never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what is going on in the world - the war in other places.
These people are fighting for what?
Why did they kill each other?
The war is now coming to our country, which I can hardly believe it.
In the past, we were a friendly country, so how did we get to the fact that we are fighting together?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many of the children in Ukraine has been and still will be killed.
If we could get all the rebels and discard them - as far as they can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The child, who swept into the safety of the special squad
Rescued: Alyonu Tskaevu bears to secure Russia's special commando (left).
She is now ten (right) and remembering the tragedy
The world gasped in 2004, when a small Alyonu carried in the arms of the Russian policeman beslanského captivity.
The terrorists released in captivity in the school gym, however, leaving her 30-year mother, sister and brother Makhara Kristina launched 10 years ago.
Makhar, who at that time was three years old, escaped, but Alyonina mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan had remarried and his new wife Svetlana have a little girl, named after her daughter Kristina.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now 10, had no memory of the attack and she was a bright and happy girl.
A close friend said that "it is a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is a good father and wants to keep children away from the memories that the 10th anniversary of the recalls.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to get better underwater photos and videos
If you are interested in photography or filming under water, you have a large selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or outdoor camera type GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, which costs around $300.
I took these pictures on a family celebration of several cameras, each costing less than $350.
It doesn't matter what you use equipment, but to achieve the best results are a number of rules.
Check the equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Also set the camera depending on what type of photos or videos will take.
Some of the cameras and camcorders have scenic or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to the dark environment under water.
And before the plunge, find out how far you can dive with their equipment.
Some of the cameras are intended only to 5 feet, the next 50 to 60.
Read our guide to buying and evaluation of digital cameras in the current and waterproof design.
Always do a few pictures - a lot of them don't work.
Compact cameras are LCD, which will help you with the composition of the photos, but the outdoor do not have it.
Even if you have the LCD, under water will be hard to see and the composition will be nepředvidatelná.
So always do more pictures.
If the camera bracketingový regime that makes a series of images with a slightly different diffusion of exposure, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper draught of light is declining significantly.
If possible, stay at a photo shoot in the swimming pool, lake or sea near the surface.
It also allows you to capture more light on the photos - the deeper you dive, the less you see colors.
Get close to the fotografovanému object.
This is excellent advice, if you do on land, but underwater is even more important because of the tlumenějšímu light.
This is particularly important when shooting with outdoorovou camera: Such devices are usually strong and wide-angle lenses, which means that if you want to fill fotorámeček, you have to bring more objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality could change things, even in such a huge organisation like the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist has devoted his career to the sick reeling from the pain caused by the disease and treatment.
His wife recalled that one of the people who seek his help, was the MI6 officer, who had to live with the consequences of torture that crippled him.
Lawson said that while doctors focus on the diagnosis and disease, treated patients overwhelmingly interested in something else: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He struggled with flu symptoms and found that he is impatient and his wife Juliet includes remorse.
He said: "I want to get everything done sooner rather than later."
When Juliet trips for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
Colleague made him a chest X-ray.
One two weeks before that went skiing in the French Alps.
Came the results of the X-ray.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura or if the lining of the lungs.
For most types of cancer, it is difficult to determine what was the cause.
Though some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer were smoking.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, it is caused by exposure to asbestos - vláknitému construction material that was previously described as a "miracle" but today we know that it is deadly.
For most of us, not hard to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos is used in Britain since the 1960s, when he entered into force a ban on the use of asbestos in the industry.
Even at a time when asbestos was used, in close contact with him were only a certain group of people, such as pokladači insulation, construction, carpenters and workers in the shipyards.
The toxin used in the industry in a different era now hardly seems to be a cause for concern.
But such complacency is not in place.
As it turns out, in Britain today culminates mezoteliomová epidemic.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma is higher than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths from the disease a year is more than twice the number of victims of car accidents.
The number of deaths on the consequences of pleural per year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in Britain
Why only now we feel its effects, even though it is the use of asbestos for years illegal (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that usually takes decades to develop mesothelioma.
The disaster in the form of pleural not not only veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and still is, in many cases, present in homes in which we live, in offices, where we work, in schools, where we learn, and in shops in which we buy.
Mesothelioma, does not respect the social layer, wealth, occupation and age.
The privileged bastions of London's commercial houses for public schools do not constitute shelter.
The Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even the hospital in which they should treat us, they are the repository of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Did not isolation.
Trying to find out where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then came to it.
"It is possible that there was a lot of asbestos in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and janitors - used the corridor.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question that could partly answer.
"Of the four doctors who were on the ground at Guy's Hospital and then showed mesothelioma in the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I'm the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma, when he was 48.
17 February this year, when he died, he was 55.
Survive with this diagnosis is not normal for so long.
The 55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat heard Lawson's question: "How many of us get sick of the same disease?"
According to a leading British expert on mesothelioma Professor Julian Pete's best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain, about 90 000 people die.
Most of them currently has no idea that she would die in this way.
An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A cursory inspection of the documents from the archives of the courts, which are often disability and require settlement, shows how much the mezoteliomická disaster spread.
For example, this June, the company admitted Marks & Spencer, negligently exposed to asbestos Janice Allenovou.
She worked for a string of nine years, from 1978 to roku1987, ever vigilant in two stores on the section with clothes - one of the places was the flagship company, the shop on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when he started working for the M & S.
Now he has two children, who are in their 20s.
"Before this happened," he says, "I had never heard of pleural, I hardly knew something about the asbestos.
I never dreamed that I could somehow relate.
Not many people who know something about the asbestos.
In fact, the asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name was given to their fibrotic structure that gives him the strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals were used in the construction of three.
Most often, it is possible to find chryzotil today in buildings, commonly known as the white asbestos.
It was used in the roof panels, floor tiles, bojlerových gaskets and even in the brake linings.
Not as lethal as other forms of asbestos, the EU and the WHO was still considered a "major health risk" that can cause death.
But it is more dangerous brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos and experts say that "there is a strong, but circumstantial evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of pleural [in the UK]."
Employee Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the flagship store in Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen is not considered to be a typical victim pleural, perhaps, but the work of Julian Pete points out that her story is not unusual.
His study of patients, says that "a substantial portion of the cases of pleural with no known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
A significant part of this exposure is caused by a "normal use and weathering" buildings.
It seems that no one could be sure that it is safe.
Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even the people in the centre of the government may not know that they might be exposed to asbestos.
Goddard has published a report in 2009, according to which the service elevators and pipes for the rooms of the parliamentary committee contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be violated by something as benign as it is "a strong current of air."
The ministers are often accused of being only care about their own interests, but in this case it may be true.
Although the Directorate of the services of Parliament insist that the Palace of Westminster had received "positive medical certificate" for now that will require one million pounds and several years of work for Parliament to be thoroughly inspected, streamline the electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the elections in 2015 will be MPs rather than sitting on the green benches at Westminster in the conference centre of Queen Elizabeth II.
In the report, Goddard says that "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with the rules."
It is not possible to say whether this inconsistency will cost lives.
They can now only wait.
One of the people who were never able to determine when their exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
As Andrew Lawson has even Abbott (50) the suspicion that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital, where she was shown the presence of asbestos," he says, "but in my case, I can't prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked, and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he conquer something like a fever.
He was 45, was in the evening and he was just in the middle of the operation.
Suddenly I was shaking.
It came at once.
I was.
I thought nedojedu car home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain stems from pleurisy, lining around the lungs.
But just as Janice Allen had no reason to believe that this is a mesothelioma.
Finally, he spent a month at home.
Confused doctors made him a chest X-ray and introduced his chest catheter to remove fluid from his lungs, which were sent for analysis.
, haven't made a diagnosis.
His condition has improved slowly and returned to work.
From time to time, but the symptoms returned, often after he flexed and the breath.
In 2011, he came into the operating room, one of the Abbott gave patients with similar symptoms and was diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott's tie with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older, and the job was in direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the link was clear.
In September 2011, Abbottův relapse and his doctor consulted his pictures from the CT and X-ray with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, just two years after the Abbott began to feel ill, he was in the area between the lung lining the cavity and inlay introduced a probe equipped with a camera.
I am an optimist.
I have a tendency not to take too much, "he says.
To be honest, I very much worry.
But Rachel, my wife, worry about.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and the New Year: "They told me that it was mesothelioma."
By Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began to meet the sisters from the charity Macmillan and one told him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that the asbestos was widely used, particularly in large public buildings, which are often asbestos thermal insulation in the pipeline," he says.
In people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, are now beginning to show the disease.
Mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have risk jobs.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were located in the basement, so it was unlikely to endanger patients.
However, members of the staff who were crossing suterénními passages between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or eating in the underground lunchroom (as often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it has been for several decades after the war, the hospital where they could save the lives of patients, but also a place that could endanger the lives of the doctors who treated them.
The asbestos is removed today.
The students built a Bunsen burner on asbestos pads
And it's not just about the hospital.
Asbestos is often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulation and fire-resistant properties.
In the schools.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in the countless hours of chemistry students built a Bunsen burner on asbestos mat.
Sites were dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like the floor tiles or roof shelters on the tools in our homes commonly contain asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there has been no contact with asbestos, in which a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember in the 1970s in breaking down the garden cottage.
So be careful how boříte garden house.
With the knowledge that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
"Takes a while before it comes to you," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I found that I can't concentrate on what I'm doing.
I was in the operating room two weeks ago.
Then I realized that I will have to go and deal with himself.
Well, the next Christmas day.
One of the hardest things was the transition from the position of the doctor on the position of the patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how he felt bewildered by the amount of information to be dealt with.
"It was hard to understand," he says.
"I asked my doctor:" How much time I have left? "
I was told that the twelve months.
I remember how I said: "Well, the next Christmas day.
So it is. "
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer, which kills.
Most of the cases pleural is caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is a tiny fibres.
When the asbestos breaches and fibres to breathe, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritates the pleura and can cause cell mutation.
"The problem is vdechnutá asbestos fibres in the shape of needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a heart surgeon, who in 2001 came to Guy's Hospital.
In the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, and that is, paradoxically, head of the centre in the treatment of pleural.
Treasure Lawson knows and treating other patients who were probably exposed to asbestos during practice in the hospital.
Needles of asbestos comes into the tissues of the lungs, says Treasure, and "the breathing is pushing the edge of where the lining.
By its nature, is invasive from the very beginning.
Current treatment options for mesothelioma used for other types of cancer as much anymore.
Hotly debated, for example, about the effectiveness of the operation.
According to some might be worth a try.
Not Treasure.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You won't get around her scalpel.
"Too many cancer does not respond to chemotherapy," which was "has some effect," but does not cure.
"Sometimes someone who will survive lung cancer," says Treasure.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients are living much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After finding the pleural Abbott contact with Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, he became an individual support and consultant for disabled people as well.
When they called, cheerfully introduced himself: "Hello, you've reached the center of cancer."
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago, and he was still very active.
At the beginning of the Abbott offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which lasted four months, and probably would have prolonged his life only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give it up.
But Lawson "was able to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott has decided to continue the treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduskim from the thoracic surgery at the hospital, Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage that I did not have to wait until they send me to him, but I just called there and they look at me," Graham says.
Normal patient would have to get a claim, and he would have to approve the settlement.
In order to be able to get the best available treatment for patients with mesothelioma is a question of money is crucial.
But when the different treatment inevitably fail, many patients facing other financial worries - about the future of the family to leave here.
And it is turning to the courts and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898 known that asbestos is harmful," says Morgan.
In the 1960s, but found that even a very small quantities can pose a health risk.
And here we have the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital will eventually match, but it was not, according to Morgan "full compensation" because Lawson could not definitively prove that mesothelioma was due to exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
After the investigation of the case, however, Guy's Hospital spokesman confirmed that "asbestos in the basement of the exposure was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
Remove the asbestos
To blame deadly asbestos exposure to one company or place of work - usually decades after it happened - for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation proved to be a huge problem.
A lot of former workplaces changed hands or go bankrupt.
The insurance has been lost.
And those who are now defending accusations, they have time on their side, and certainly not the prosecutors.
In response to this fact was important new legislation approved this year, thanks to which it is easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek a settlement, even if it is not possible to trace their former employer.
The law created a 350 million-dollar financial reserve, which is paid by insurance companies, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos, but not impossible.
In this case, the disability will receive 80% of the amount that would give them in a normal case, the court as a settlement - approximately 120 000 pounds.
Each year, is expected to 300 successfully processed applications.
Andrew Morgan, as well as patients with mesothelioma thinks that 350 million pounds is a "good job."
"This is an agreement drafted by the insurance for insurance companies," he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if not for the time and people with mesothelioma would have been able to ascertain the former employer and the normal way to sue them.
Even Mike Penning, a former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had gaps."
But even Morgan Penning admit that due to the seven deaths each year, it was necessary to act quickly.
"People are suffering too much and they need help right now," said Penning in December last year during the second reading of the law concerning the pleural.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunskiho 19 months.
After the initial consultation recommended Lang-Lazdunski operation, which, unlike Tom Treasura thought he has a positive effect.
After the operation, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - triple therapy, in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast five-year survival rate of up to 40% of patients.
Abbott it.
That, of course, is not the most important thing, "says Abbott.
Patients can see it all the time.
There is something that motivates you.
If you give up, your condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
The survey showed no symptoms of the disease.
I went to the control in March [2014].
Scattered in the chest, I had a few spots [cancer].
Just approaching my 50th birthday.
It does not endanger the life.
It takes him.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Currently, there are no traces of the cancer in his body.
But it is physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - the financial security, when I die, or to show women how to work the clock on the pot.
You learn the bad news, you will start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for the father of Ellie (16) and I'm Tamsin (14) is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It is difficult to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis of the girls I said that my condition means that I will never be old.
Their reaction was different.
'm Tamsin is a lot of social and wild.
She said that friends and suddenly began to call us a lot of people.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such talks must face all patients with cancer.
In patients with mesothelioma but such talks are not odlehčeny hope, or just a hint of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought and Stephen Jay Gould) grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma does not endanger the life."

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose the leadership - protesters promising revenge
The Chinese parliament, despite numerous discussions on democratic reform in Hong Kong Sunday decided not to allow voters to nominate candidates for the election in 2017.
It is likely that this step will create long-promised protests in the business district of Hong Kong, since activists began to organize and prepare for only a few hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress essentially allows the communist leaders to exclude any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It wouldn't surprise us, but it infuriated us," said zákonodárkyně Emily Lau, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
To the people in Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defence of the Chinese decision, said Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei, to allow public nominations in the election of Hong Kong's leadership would cause "chaos."
Since 1997, when Britain returned to China the administration of Hong Kong, Beijing promised that, starting in 2017, residents will be able to elect the executive branch.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, because Hong Kong allows a direct vote, the decision but also clearly demonstrates that the Chinese leaders held firmly in the hands of the process of nominating committee, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause will be přípustní only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong."
The decision came after the summer months, which have seen some of the largest and most reported protests in Hong Kong for several years.
For most of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong's hour limb movements with love and peace, whose organizers have threatened the financial district if Beijing does not grant them the right to vote.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the hour gathered in the rain in front of the seat of government of Hong Kong.
The demonstration organizers told that their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks will launch a wave of protests.
But did not provide any further details, apparently trying to avoid problems with the authorities.
In his Internet statement organisers said that the movement "to consider the occupation of limb just as the last step in the event that they had exhausted all the possibilities of dialogue and have no other choice.
We regret to announce that today were exhausted all the possibilities of dialogue and fill the limb is inevitable.
The authorities in Hong Kong at the announcement of Beijing prepared for days and strengthen the protection of the government's headquarters on Sunday and deployed policemen and barricades.
Fomenting the unrest, according to many residents of Hong Kong sign that slowly loses control of the city.
A surge of people from the mainland increased competition in the field of products and services.
There is also a growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are increasing pressure from Beijing bent.
Some people criticise the hour limb and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - the lifeboat Hong Kong.
"The protest, which he speaks, could cause a much greater economic damage, depending on how many people will attend, and for how long," says politician Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to spread fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could damage the investment.
Chinese state media also came in recent days with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong portrayed as subversive agents managed by the West.
In the summer of activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which came 780 000 participants - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the area.

The League in Jihlava wears the name of the political movement
Small football plays in the county town of the Highlands approximately 1 600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition, the newly named Together for Jihlavu League.
The name was given by a movement that is going to last October's municipal elections.
A dozen of his ballot is, moreover, head of a small football in Jihlava Jan Mráka.
"It was a general meeting, where there was no problem with that," said Mráka.
The situation around the first small football league has already dealt with lawyers jihlavské City Hall and advised to change the system of distributing subsidies.
Small football acquired last year, according to the Web site of the city of about a million crowns.
This year, the amount in the hundreds of thousands.
According to legal opinion is not a process in violation of the law or the directives.
But the situation is for the incentive to adjust the rules governing the allocation of grants and subsidies, "said City Hall spokesman Radek Tulis.
Receive subsidies from the city and at the same time to express a little football support in the election of a political party, it probably won't work.
The "big" football vysočinský a similar request from politicians yet.
That would be incurred ČSSD county championship, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And the class and similar competition?
I would not be.
Conversely, I would like to turn us from the ranks of corporate sponsors, "said the chairman of the regional football association Miroslav Vrzáček.
The boss of a small football other parties and movements in the name of the league won't
According to a small football players would take the sport in Jihlava deserved its own area with six of the playground, closets and bathrooms.
"For example, playground Na Stoupách is not ours, we are there in the lease," said Andrew Lapeš Starlet Jihlava from the club.
The most appropriate site would be the Bohemian mill.
But there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a pointless campus for skateboarders, which is about fifty in Jihlava, "said Mráka.
The Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that it uses a small football pitch with artificial turf in the streets of Rošického and Na Stoupách, which are the property of the city.
We want to build a playground, which have a maximum use.
We are upgrading or building stadiums in the schools, which will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think that for a small football has made huge progress in recent years, "said Vymazal.
Other political parties in the titles of leagues, according to John Mráky.
We have.
If anyone in the partnership to us from one field, so we don't give second there anymore, "he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, that is, at least for the unfortunate step," said a member of the Commission for Sport Karel Voldán.
"But voters will evaluate whether Mr Mráka uses a bunch of Little football Jihlava and city subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
The American tradition seeps into university life - freshmen can fly jet
We are pleased that we can respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel services for students in Britain.
For the purpose of leaving the best possible impression upon arrival at the university, the company also offers the possibility of transport, including private jet or cars of Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also said that the service has its own security page.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to carry their belongings across the entire state in a dangerously laden car.
We look forward to our vif (very important fresher - a very important a freshman) variants students this year, we will ensure that the university will arrive with a minimum of nervousness and a peak of luxury.
The company spokesman said that since the service was launched, they have no reservations so far, but he added: "The students are going to make reservations over the next few weeks."
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition fees of £9,000, expects that the service will find its place in the market.
Compared with the students of ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today's students are different in terms of expectations and desires - is more important than ever to make a good first impression and vif program is exactly the right way to do it.
The National Union of students but the service criticised as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, vice-president of the Union for higher education, said: "For the majority of students, such a project is unattainable.
A lot of students who are picked up this month at the university, must take before fired thousands of pounds for something as simple as going to college, to deal with the financial crisis, because the available financial aid in the form of loans and grants fails to keep pace with the rising costs of basic needs.
Feminists, after the events in Fergusonu opposes racism and the conduct of the police
At the beginning of the month, he killed a policeman in Fergusonu in Missouri, an unarmed young man.
People waiting at the funeral with his hands up, chanting: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Fergusonu in Missouri because of the unarmed youth Michael Brown, noted blogger Miriam Zoila Perézová shift in online discussions, the white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and equality of income, prefer white feminists sex before the race.
The growing tension in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perézová noted that the reaction of white women in the 100% focused on the race.
In comparison with the reactions of the struggling soon after the shooting on August 9, the personal articles with titles like "reflection white over Ferguson" or "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
According to Perézové but it represents a significant change.
"I think in the feminist movement is not a lot of people who would talk about race and privileges at such a level," she said.
People feel that what has happened must express.
For the crisis we are facing, it is distinctive because [the situation in Fergusonu] is so racially pronounced that they had to draw attention to it.
According to Professor of English at the State University in Ohio Korithy Mitchell made Ferguson to light the problems Afroameričanky must face every day, and that in the cultural sphere are not perceived as "women's issues."
"I can publish on Facebook funny stories of life with his partner, and gets a 150 liků from people from all over the world," said Mitchell.
When I write something about that coloured people are trapped in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How is it possible that a woman can publicly talk about relationships, but not about the safety of the public space?" She asked.
For a black woman like Mitchell, which dealt with the issue of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between the issues of race and gender.
Black woman, according to her could not afford the luxury clearly to divide these problems: They live every day in this mixed reality.
Although the white today, the question of race and gender in mainstreamových feminist circles, Angela Hatteryová, professor of women's studies and gender studies lecturer at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890 was at least 10 000 blacks lynčováno and the reason was in almost all cases of rape white, "said Hatteryová.
You need to justify the lynching cooperation of white women.
According to Hatteryové schism between white women and the black women came when voting rights campaigner like Susan B. Anthony examined at the end of the 19th century, the terrain and realized that the electoral law can have only one group of people - women or blacks.
"They decided to put the cards on voting rights for women and the right for blacks to focus later," explained Hatteryová.
When we realise this, we will gain an important insight into why women don't trust white women of color.
We have not done a good job.
We've never černoškám not help to protect their spouses and children.
Even after the women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years before they began to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Women for the prevention of lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after the first black woman said for help.
According to Mitchell's surge of white feminists responses to the questions that events in Fergusonu brought - the behavior of the police, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" issues which are experienced generations.
"It would be great if activists in these areas [traditional feminism] take the right to raise a child as seriously as they take the right to contraception?" Raised Mitchell.
The second wave of feminists who have made careers fight for reproductive rights and access to contraception, are finding out what it means.
Prominent feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after the shooting death of Michael Brown's attack Facebook, where Rebecca Carrollové published a column from the Guardian, which demanded that white Americans forcefully protested against racism.
"I hope that women who have different, yet similar reasons for the understanding of the danger in the company - and views on race, which is significantly different in opinion polls - will seek to change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem holds intersekcionální feminism, which includes the issues of race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America, some people confuse.
An expert at the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommersová, author of the book "Who stole feminism?," she said to She The People, that young men in the United States, especially young colored men are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but the remarks Steinemové parties Fergusonu is facing criticism, which has raised previously.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for the boy.
But when the White House launched a program of My Brother's keeper, who was helping vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it brought in many feminists, including Gloria Steinemové angry reactions.
The police relationship to the black community is not the only problem that is coming to the fore mainstreamového feminism.
After the American border police arrested this year in the southwest of the country nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors, again raised the issue of reform immigration laws - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercadová, Co-Chair, We Belong Together, the organisation of mobilizing women for the reform of immigration laws, said that in order to raise the question as necessary for women, all she had to do was to share the stories of immigrant women.
"Speak for themselves," says Mercadová.
Given that most of the work permits are granted to the men, the women that come with them, find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories are in the women's organisations," she said.

The Deutsche Bahn trains cannot make the evening.
Engineers want higher wages
The GDL in a press statement described the protest as a warning strike for which deliberately chosen peak time.
Chosen by the time of the strike GDL takes account of many of the people who were returning from the weekend by rail during the first working day.
At the same time, we think, even for commuters during the day, "the union said in a press statement on Monday morning to the strike.
"Our first strike should intervene in freight transport, fewer passengers anymore," said GDL.
DB, meanwhile, the official response to the strike debunked.
Nor is it clear how the industrial action would affect international rail connections, among other things, with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding wage increases of five percent of drivers and a reduction in working hours for two hours a week.
At present, the average salary of drivers varies depending on the thousands of years between 36 and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year.
Engineers at the DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refused to accede to the growth of salaries in the reduction of working hours.
Pointing out that the wage evaluation of drivers must evolve as well as in the rest of the railway personnel in which DB is not reducing the working week.
Threatening to Krestův car starts to burn.
Therefore the Czech Rally ended
What exactly happened?
It was a defect of the material.
The car was completely new, so I never thought something like this could happen.
It wasn't exhaust provisionally repaired and continue to a slower pace in the garage, where mechanics changed him?
If we went straight there, yes.
But there were two other erzety us and it didn't.
It is a high temperature and the risk that the car began to burn, it was great.
I can't afford it.
At full speed you have mastered five speed tests.
What you had the impression from them?
Very good.
I felt like a young.
We were fast, but I didn't go through Vint.
It was caused by the fact that the car we busied ourselves for more than half a year to be on some level.
The race showed that we did.
You drove him so that you could actually win.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really ought to win.
Work come to nothing.
On the other hand, the result of which we could think of, whatever.
But it is Barumka.
Technique, unfortunately, she said no.
You're not one of the leaders who prematurely resigned from the battle for supremacy.
Get out of him and foreign favoriti Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Were you surprised that so many favorites resigned?
Yes it.
Especially for the spectators, it was a pity, because the race ended prematurely.
At the top was moving for a long time, and Jaromír Tarabus, which you are about the car.
But it, flew out of the track and took a nearly two-minute shortfall.
How have you been happy with his performance?
It's a pity, because he could repeat the degree of winners.
It was the first two times.
But even Mira confirmed that the car we've got well.
Went very quickly.
Exactly a year ago, you announced the end of his career, but you have to start Barum Rally appeared.
It can make you a good sense of the journey back to a regular participant rallyových plants?
Certainly not at this moment.
Last year, I said that Barumka is my last race, and I kept it.
I decided that I will go back.
It was my nineteenth start here, and when the chances will be back in a year, maybe I'll go into it.
But I don't think about anything further.
A lot of people came to the track just for you.
Pleased you?
To a certain extent, we took off because of them.
A lot of people, known and unknown, constantly asking if I go.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumce?
The team goes on.
Next week, we'll go to Vyškova, where he will compete Robert Adolf.
I hope that the car is very damaging.
In addition to this race from us wants to borrow fabii Honza Sykora.
With Mira awaits us European dvojzávod in Switzerland and in Corsica.
Now, we will have to prepare for the next year.
Can you suggest anything anymore?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Corsican Rally belonged to the World Cup, the fifth place you've reached its peak in the series.
Doesn't appeal to you to try the lines again?
Not to.
An oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you won't expose from a doctor's certificate of disability that serve as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform duties for health reasons.
Moreover, the absence of you immediately announced the employers.
Consequently, there has been an agreement that the days will be recorded as a vacation, but the agreement was only verbal.
Although the labor law does not impose an obligation to confirm the employer's consent in writing with the drawdown of holiday, in practice, the process worked.
If there is only a verbal agreement, you don't have confirmation of the agreement.
Later, it may be the alleged agreement with spending holidays, as well as in your case, absenteeism invalidated and assessed as a long-term unauthorised absences, hence the reason for the immediate abolition of the employment relationship under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a dispute about the conspiracy with your employer and demonstrable evidence is lacking.
Working relationship with you but has not been cancelled under Section 53, only to have the dates listed in the absence of zápočtovém sheet as improper.
Unauthorised absence in zápočtovém sheet does not have the same consequences as Section 53 (such as the inability to receive physical security in unemployment), yet it is the difficulties the possibility of finding a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and keep in writing to confirm that there has been an accident, as a result of which you have been unable to work (not a so-called "sick," it is only about a doctor).
In the search for a new job, you can submit the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate to underestimate how exposure to written medical certificate of incapacity, so early notification of the employer or demand written consent to the drawdown of holiday.
The order of potential complications.
Accident of Tony Stewart on his return to the track
A return to the track for Tony Stewart finished just over half of Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the fence for the second time after his bike in the 172nd right front tire burst, and the race ended for him.

We always had it all, making it virtually a second pond around the cabin.
Then we poured Savo.
Incredible stench!
Our wells in the basement was always plenty of beautiful perfumed water.
And it was very professionally done, my grandfather made her at home.
Long ago.
It was just the three of them and generally quirky, like everything else in the cabin, but, as I say.
The water was.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we are running out of water.
If there was a number of months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed to us that the water somehow smells.
We wondered if there was something.
At the point where the pump, with a bit of bad luck was possible, a board did not reach him there, so the hole was sealed with a piece of bricks.
Our inspections confirmed that the brick moving.
Otherwise, nothing could be seen in the water, and we prosvítili it to the bottom.
So we launched her again and přečistili.
Of course, we have improved the improvised seals around the pipe pumps.
We noticed in the basement but strange things.
On the ground was sticky package with some bones dropped.
So it seemed.
And the next.
Now it looked like oslintaná mouse.
In the ceiling, in places where there are vents, grandfather invention, the remnants of the fish.
And heavily jeté!
Our cellar is quirky, too.
Some would say that my grandfather, it would dig a cabin.
And would not so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor is just packed sand, only the ceiling is podbitý.
They are mainly ships there.
And the.
And deck chairs on the beach.
The doors are wide gaps were mostly open, as someone went there in one piece.
Several already mentioned in the ceiling vents.
Without the network, so there routinely zalétávají birds and build nests in the rafters.
The mouse, it is unnecessary to mention.
My grandfather wanted to luftovalo, and that it did.
Now, however, neither til didn't help.
The cellar smelled.
So we cleaned up the entire basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nourishing.
We threw the things that have been around: Boards, heraklitovou plate, and so on.
Our cabin at a distance, greeted the smell of disinfectant.
We thought that we could drag the disgusting remnants?
The nearest cat lived two kilometers away in the village.
It would be difficult to us svačit went.
Grandpa attacked a neighbor who is not quite right.
If he's the Frant us the disgusting nešoupnul air vent there?
There is virtually throughout the year, dumb ideas, that he has.
We decided to the cellar and well guarded and monitored regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, just for washing and washing before the tests will be finished, but it was good.
Pull the water from the springs is not what I wanted to do something for a long time.
Once we heard the terrible anguish of our dogs.
Mom looked down from the balcony and saw in the grass beside the porch of a strong black hose.
Réza bounced over her and squealing like a fool.
Mom scolded her, because she thought Réza dug up the hose from the basin.
Suddenly, but the hose smotala partly into a ball and partially straightened.
On the balcony was a hiss.
Réza hysterics.
We ran down.
Snake, well over three feet long and thick as býkovec, was about to swallow a toad and Réza defended her.
It was not clear whether she wanted to save the toad, or if she wanted to eat alone, but that was irrelevant.
When she saw the snake outnumbered in the form of our entire family, I said, let's eat it, when we have these shores, and stretched gracefully through the air shaft into the basement.
We flew behind her.
As the lightning jumped as well.
Incidentally, we have seen on the board of another smelly package.
According to the smell of a goldfish.
There was the day before yesterday.
Our new security around the pump was a bit wonky.
And we have a basement locked up during the day.
That....
We went out there and we each got to a snorkel.
We waited for a long time.
Wells behind the mantelpiece.
First appeared flat with yellow marigolds on his neck.
Then the whole snake swung at the wellhead.
She wrapped around the pumps and began to conquer inside.
Fired employee vengeance, the firm bought laptops and sell them
Emotionally wounded employee after the release of the firm bought a computer and then sold them.
This money could spend before the detention by the police.
Within a short time the man bought in twelve cases, a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"After the takeover of laptops contained in Olomouc, where it is sold at the bazaar," said police Chief Commissioner šumperské Rostislav Bruckner.
The motive was revenge for the release of employer fraud and also the profit of money.
"During the interrogation has argued that the money was used for loan repayments," said Bruckner.
The police also found that fraud is a pathological gambler who has repeatedly been treated by a psychiatrist.
The money could also end up in the slot machines or in videoloterijních terminals.
"The fact of the matter is that we haven't found any money for him," he said.
The impostor who was already being punished for theft, now faces a jail term of one year and five years.
So far, police have not told whether bazarům also threatened punishment, which bought laptops under the price and continued to sell them.
"It is true that over completely new goods, which is minimally suspicious," the commissioner said.
None of the owners of the bazaar, however, has not been charged.
Come on, a little bit more, you can do or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, organizers have prepared us for a number of changes.
The biggest change was the route that brought the target in the shallows, rather than leading back to the yellow baths.
I was looking forward to the race, along with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, I was going to live a little bit but it from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally salute our readers at the newsstand, where we were shooting together pictures and videos.
I dragged his gaze from the other side to perfection, I accepted the role of personal conductors.
Along with her friend Katya, we just before takeoff obediently placed at the end of the corridor of 60 to 70 minutes.
We were greeted with friends who walked around us in the sector for faster runners.
Now there wasn't much time.
A few tricks to warm up, turn on sporttestery, the countdown and start!
Shouts of jubilation, but instead of fast-start followed by scampering to the starting line.
After five minutes, we come to the gate, energizing measurements and rozbíháme pace for an hour of ten.
The yellow snake proplétáme runners who, like Cath is running his first race.
So far, they all look fresh, slowly decreasing the sun in the sky adds perspective on Vyšehrad almost gaudy tinge.
Vibrant meat stretching along the waterfront looks as if there was a whole Prague.
On the waterfront between the Vyšehrad castle and the National Theatre is traditionally starting to show who is how many forces.
A slight hill for forcing many runners to slow down or go to a walk.
Just before přeběhem Theater to see a police escort and followed by flying Vítek Pavlišta incredible pace into the goal.
I can hear the admiring ufuněné sigh of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, encouraging him to slap me, but just before I podvrtne leg and our hands are just pass.
Seběh Theater street gives a chance for a short rest and breathe.
It is necessary, there are places where projections floored me.
Turn on Mánesově bridge shows Prague in the beauty of the setting sun.
I and my legs are almost alone.
The first občerstvovačkou is the moment of truth.
The road rollover Cath škobrtne jump the curb and showing off her forties moved gracefully.
I look if she needed help, and launching a series of encouraging words that did not have time to think about the pain.
It moves up and down the aisle Coat, this is one of the narrowest points of the track, at this stage of the race there is no crowding, yet but it is necessary to monitor the area well.
Yet I don't know that the concept of the closest place gets its true significance at a later date.
A popular gateway we had frantically encourage tourists and friends of the other runners.
I'm trying to tlesknout with anyone who will offer a hand, and I suggest that Katya might as well, because the ten hand clap with fans is like half the energy bars.
It really works, we're accelerating again, and although we were strongly enough, now began to chase the ride.
Dozens of runners ourselves, when passing someone particularly tired, I'm trying to cheer him up a few words: "Come on, a little bit more, you can do it!"
None of us in the last občerstvovačkou nepředbíhá, accelerating.
Meanwhile, we ran for an hour and a quarter, we are adding, not on what to expect.
Three miles into the objectives will be hurt, but it is necessary to really work.
The sun sank slowly and ended the day symbolically slowly exiting the race.
The last run of the bridge, turn and only home stretch into the goal.
The rate at which we run, amazes me, where it takes in this girl?
"Come on, let's go under an hour of thirteen, hustle!" Call.
We're trying, sprintujeme and there is a target.
Hour of thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
Coach entered the twenty-hour limit.
So, seven minutes under the plan.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Katya might legs, helping her to the railing, where he is resting.
It is to see the exhaustion, but also the happiness of well-paid performance.
After a while, I'm doing it slowly out of the area.
The euphoria doesn't make us think of the crowd in the passageways to the dressing rooms.
Here is to see that the Goat Lane was the narrowest point.
It is up to the náplavka here, which is under the onslaught of the nearly ten thousand runners jam-packed.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it is not the place for him.
I, too, after a while, I'm losing my head and I wonder if those beautiful views, and in contrast to recent years more interesting route stood for what is happening in the goal.
I know from experience that the holding of the race is no fun.
If you add to that the ten thousand people, rich entertainment and the closure of the centre of Prague for all transport, it is a huge challenge.
This year's change of route runners showed many interesting places, but also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
Excellent atmosphere rozpumpovaná in yellow spas are passed between the runners in the race.
The organizers around the track and innocent bystanders increasing it on every subway line.
Running in the city's historic center, unfortunately, must reckon with the obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of the plant at the site, which is surrounded by walls on one side and on the other side of the river, is the best solution.
If you say that the race had ended proběhnutím goal, I consider him as a very good.
I was a bit worried for the purpose of the health of the participating, but in the end.
Write us into the discussion, if you like, and what do you think about the situation in the goal.
Prison guards in Bulgaria are organizing protests
Hundreds of employees of the prison service in Bulgaria participated in the national protest rally in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital city of Sofia.
The peaceful demonstration reiterated its demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions that have changed in recent times.
On the list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov, are even higher salaries.
The guards symbolically protested against the new working hours and called for a return to the original 20-hour shifts.
Although the unions prison officers and officials of the Ministry of Justice met, agreed, informed the Bulgarian state radio (NBR).
"The negotiations are still ongoing," said NBR head of the Directorate General of the prison service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is expected that the protests of the prison service will also join the members of the Federation of unions of employees at the Ministry of the Interior.
Why the universe may have more dimensions and we don't see them
The physicists usually write bestsellers, but Brian Greene of Columbia University in 1999 managed one shot.
His book The Elegant Universe became accessible to laymen way to penetrate to the thicket of problems, which are now engaged in a series of theoretical physicists - uniting two well-functioning, but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: The theory of quantum theory and general relativity.
One reason for the success of the universe Elegantního undoubtedly is that, in the case of the search for a unified theory of physics is not a boring story.
Physicists fundamental problem between the two key theories (but at the moment it is our universe de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) tackled and resolved so creatively that it stands behind the proxies and specialists.
Greene had a complex material so lush and engagingly advised, moreover, that he cannot be blamed for how many interesting did not include in his book.
Moreover, his "mistake" for the most part, set in the next two books: The structure of the universe and the Hidden reality.
Apparently even the author would have no objection if his book zastarávala faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years of The Elegant Universe is still almost everything essential to an informed layman with ambitions to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the next few years will be in this area was only slightly more animated (perhaps because the accelerator LHC finally goes on "full throttle"), and so it is a good time to enter into the world of Greene peacefully open door of modern physics.
How many dimensions can have our universe?
The idea that our universe is perhaps more than the three spatial dimensions, it may sound silly, fantastic, strange and mystical.
Still, it is a concrete and totally acceptable.
To understand this, odvraťme briefly from the universe as a whole to something přízemnějšímu, namely the long and thin a garden hose to water.
Imagine that pent-up a garden hose kick from one side of the canyon to the other, and the whole scene from půlkilometrové distances (as in the picture, and on the next page).
From a distance you notice a long horizontal easily outstretched hose, but if you're just bystrozrakostí, barely recognize the thickness of the hose.
Because of its large distance from the hose, one would think, the ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension, which can browse: Left-to-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks, where he was an ant at the time, there was only one statistic: The distance of an ant from the left (or right) by the end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a distance půlkilometrové looks a long piece of hose as a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose thickness.
If it helps, we will see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle wound around the hose.
In such an expanded perspective, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two dimensions: In the already well-known Left-Right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in / in a counterclockwise direction" around kruhovéhoprůřezu hoses.
You begin to understand that, in order to determine the location of a small mravenečka must specify two numbers: How far it is from the end of the hose and where there is a circle wound around the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is a two-dimensional (NB Experts perceive that this chapter is focused purely on the fault tolerance string theory.
Neporuchové aspects of through Chapter 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: One long longitudinal dimension is shown a straight arrow, dimension in the direction of the circuit, marked with a circular arrow is short and coiled.
Between these two dimensions, however, is a clear difference.
Dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
Dimension wound around the perimeter of the hose is short, "roll" and less noticeable.
To the existence of the circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates an important characteristic of spatial dimensions.
It is divided into two groups.
They can either be a big, big and therefore directly, or, conversely, a small, trimmed and much less noticeable.
Of course, in that case, we just nepředřeli to "scroll" dimension wound around the thickness of the hose was discovered.
Enough to take to help the telescope.
But if the hose was thinner - such as hair or capillary-up dimension we discovered only with great effort.
Kaluza sent in 1919 to Einstein's article, in which he came up with the astonishing idea that the geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions known to all of us.
His radical claim Kaluza justified by the fact that the additional dimension offers elegant and persuasive framework within which to Einstein's theory of general relativity and Maxwell electromagnetic use into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Now the question arises as to how far this Kaluzův observation together with the obvious fact that we can see just three dimensions of space.
The answer that Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and he spoke clearly and clarified the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands or falls with the assertion that the geometry of the universe may be as large and rolled-up dimensions.
This means that, as well as the dimension in the direction of the length of the hose and our universe has a large, large and easily visible three dimensions, whose existence was aware of every moment.
But by analogy with a circular perimeter garden hose may have the space and the extra dimension, tightly coiled into a space so small that has remained hidden from our sleekest experimental aparaturami.
To get a clearer idea of the nature of the remarkable Kaluzova proposal, let's stay a little longer in the hose.
Imagine the perimeter of the hose do we draw a relatively thick black paint a series of circles.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With binoculars now, thanks to expose the furled dimension drawing even more easily, we will see a motive in Figure 2.
Clearly, we can see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one large and almost limitless dimensions and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but except for one small circular dimension has three large spatial dimensions, so čtyřiprostorovédimenze together.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
In order to help a bit of his imagination, let us note illustrations on obr.3; it shows two large dimensions and a small circular dimension.
The picture zooming in view of the geometry of space, as we increase the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level, represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe may have an additional dimension (we see them on the fourth level of magnification), where they are rolled up into a small space enough; we explain that we have not seen them directly.
The rectangular grid represents a commonly known "big" dimension, while the circle of a new, tiny and coiled dimension.
Just like a loop of thread in the densely cloth carpet, and these circles exist in every place of normal dimensions - we just named it is only because of the ease of the intersections in the square network.
The background image 4 is a commonly known structure of space - a world around us - in such current scales, such as meters, as shown by a small square in the square network.
In each of the following picture focusing on a small area of the previous image; it helps to become visible.
At first, nothing is happening, as we see in the first few levels of magnification.
However, when we move on their way to the microscopic properties, geometry of space - the fourth level of increase in Figure 3 - we will see a new, in the shape of a circle furled dimension, a similar thread loops in the densely homespun piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that the additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of the large dimensions, as has the hose circular circuit in each of its length.
We in order to ease the circular dimension named only in certain, regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 Kaluzovu and Kleinovu idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of space summarizes.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, though there are also important differences.
Firstly, the universe has three large, distant echoes of spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has a large dimension only one.
The more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just on some object inside the universe, perhaps our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If additional circular-coiled dimension is extremely miniature, recognize it is - as well as the circular perimeter hose - much harder than to observe the obvious, large and spacious dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is low enough to reveal her will, in fact, even over the strength of our most advanced tools to increase.
But most important is that the additional dimension is not merely a domed hrbolkem within the normal proportions, as two-dimensional illustrations mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension which exists in each of the three current vast proportions.
It is a dimension in the remaining three dimensions independent as well as the dimensions of the top-down, left-right and front-to-back independent (and) at right angles to each other.
Small enough mraveneček could move in all four dimensions and to determine its position, we would need four figures, in addition to the three normal another position in the circular dimension; if the time, then five figures, in any case, one more than we would normally expect.

The price for the e-book is 149, - CZK.
To our surprise, we find that, although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, shows Kaluzovo and Klein's thinking that this does not exclude the existence of additional furled dimensions, if they are sufficiently small.
The universe may have more dimensions than can be seen with the naked eye.
How small should be?
The latest technical equipment can detect the structure of a large part a billionth of a meter.
Smaller coiled dimension we can barely see.
In 1926, Klein combined the original Kaluzův idea with a few ideas from just emerging quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that additional circular dimension could be the size of approximately one of the Planck length, thus far beyond the size of today's devices.
Since then, physicists called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluzovou-Kleinovou theories.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises how to train on an electric guitar: 5 share
The whole point of "Twelve" lies in dvanáctitaktové harmonious form, which you can repeat arbitrarily.
Who gropes in musical theory, finds the principle set out here.
Jan Homola, or John Homolka Capsule (1976)
The puppeteer training and puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be seen here, from the prom twenty years ago as a graphic artist alive.
The band's guitarist Wohnout, of which, unfortunately, is reportedly not to leave.
The guitarist is after his father, as well as a brother Matthew, Wohnoutů leader.
With the training start on a ribbon.
"The rhythmic model is only for you, you can invent anything, then it is enough to apply to the harmonious model of lager," says John.
When you add another chord, you can figure vary again.
You only have to listen to and watch John what we can with the number harmonies on two strings to invent and how much it begins to sound.
If the third přiberete chord, you can flirt with the melody of a song.
Finally, when you add a fourth, careful not to change the tuning, warns John in the video.
Next time, John returns to pentatonice and you try to put it together with a dozen or so.
So it honestly exercise.
How best to read it in an interview with John Homolou at the first lesson of his school games on an electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It is not a big celebration, recognises hradecký Dvořák
We take the point and we are happy for him.
The first half we had more chances, the second home, "said the attacker, who scored from the penalty kick this time.
Have you been in with his nervous, but it was accompanied by a huge whistle?
I hadn't noticed much, though for the second wicket, where the home fans, it probably would have been worse.
You Penaltou after half an hour, but you've also got a goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We're late start, we were passive, arose from the corner and then a penalty after him.
After you've got up and the first half they were the better team, who had more chances.
Why is it changed after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played after inkasovaném field goal until the break.
In the cabin, we have said that we want to keep the tempo of the game, even after her, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't explain why.
But it is also true that home to break something to his game said they probably weren't too happy with it.
You have to just scored for the first time, while at home, you might even got a goal.
Why is it such a difference?
I don't think it's such a difference, but it depends on us, how to deal with it.
In Brno, we started well, but then it was bad from us, Plzeň, that is another category.
The four games were waiting for a goal, you should not fear that it may be similar in the last match?
Not exactly, but of course we are glad that since the last game we don't talk about waiting for the goal to listen.
Now we have added another without waiting, but they are still only three in six games, which is not yet a big celebration.
Iceland - the lava flowing from the crater miles distant.
The lava pouring onto the surface of the glaciers in the Holuhraun near the central Neskaupstaður flow in the underground tunnel from miles distant crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the underground lava tube.
This fact is now scientists concerned.
For now, the situation remains constant.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still vyletuje from cracks about the same amount of lava.
Compared to the original estimates, however, is the amount of less than 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times greater.
Scientists, however, fear that the lava tube could open, even in places where it is located under the ice.
If that happened, and with a similar intensity that shows the current eruption, it would mean massive floods, both on the river Jökulsá á Fjöllum and other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption is a strong smell of sulphur, the cracks are rising clouds of steam and gas.
Certainly this is not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the Fimmvörðuháls eruption in 2010.
This is a much bigger, and there is also a lot more gas, "says vulkanolog Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, in the morning there was almost no wind in the area.
Of a sandstorm had been washed away by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic is the orange level (second highest) for Bárðarbungu and yellow (third) for Askju.
The sky above Chebem belonged to the courageous Lady Peggy.
Passed the wings
The day in Berlin.
The machine Boeing Stearman PT-17 was introduced air acrobat Peggy Walentinová, who climbed out of the cockpit on the flight to the bar on the upper wing dvouplošníku and also between the wings.
There is dependent only on the strength of the muscles.
The air show in Berlin, was held for the fifth time this year, and the organizers are once again managed to prepare some interesting air pieces.
The premiere of the oldest Czech airport said not only "walking along the wings" in the German acrobats Peggy Walentinové, but also the legendary D P-51 Mustang fighter plane or the Beechcraft 18.
The attention to himself with his glowing skin.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking has its origins in the US.
After World War II, tried to push through so many former military pilots.
But because of the large number of fatalities was banned.
Today, but slowly returns to the air days.
Peggy crawls out of the cockpit after takeoff on the upper wing.
There is the different exercises.
Toward the end of the speech will move into the space between the wings of the plane, where the show continues, "described by Luděk Matějíček from Chebského Ultralight Club and the organizer of the day.
The pilot for the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If the speech Peggy was the centerpiece of the program, then the performance of legendary Mustang fighter was the icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter came to the area with the Czech Army's Grippeny in tow (so-called the numbers).
Such a report could see the fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then all showed breathtaking acrobatics with the plane in 1945.
He was still produced during the war, but she probably never attended.
He was included in the military reserves.
Since 1963, he worked in the civilian sphere.
Even as a racing aircraft.
Today has its home hangar at the airport in Mnichovo Hradiště.
In the same place is also another pearl Chebského air on the Beechcraft twin-engine C45H Expeditor.
A massive machine at the airport did not overlook.
His polished aluminum coating glowed in the distance.
He earned the admiration and machine Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colours of the French Air Force.
A small passenger plane caught behind odřeknutý aircraft and from the German Hof had delivered part of the German delegation at the air show.
Germany's neighbors in Chisinau demonstrated with reconstructed aircraft How 18t or three formations dvouplošníků Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhyová: A dramatic return in front of the camera.
Parental worries exchanged Lucie Borhyová, at least for tonight for the job.
The stress or anxiety - blonde presenter obviously does not know any of this.
Moderovaní television news because it went well, she had never stopped for two months.
It's only the two weeks that ended blonde confinement in which women are experiencing the biggest stress after birth.
Lucie, however, in the main news session TV Nova will still show regularly.
It's a fair return, according to the information Blesk.cz until next month.
After all, her daughter Linda now needs more than a television audience.
Lucie Borhyová returned to the TV screen, and it was right on target.
The exhibit a year in Prague?
Hall would vyprodala, is planning a bachelor party Jágr
It would be decent, if something like that was during the World Cup.
But it depends how to stand up to the union, "he said in Jihlava after the exhibition with the name of the Golden game, in which he again met a breathtaking naganský team.
Even the players who were involved in the golden hattricku.
The players would have had a taste, isn't it?
Surely it.
In short, it would be good to do a farewell with a golden generation during the championship.
I can find one of two days during the tournament, which is a full day off and where you could get a game.
We tell gumovi (George Šlégrovi) or Béďovi Ščerbanovi (organizer from Jihlava struggle), who would take care of it.
The arena vyprodala.
But what if you play with the New Jersey playoffs?
So when I arrive...
But you don't want to play in the entertainment.
Or jihlavské meeting somehow amended your decision?
Representation and exhibition match are two different things and entertainment are crucial in the performance.
One thing is that people like to see me there, but the performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
They should take players who are on it, and not just because they have a good name.
My decision is not changed.
How did you actually take it naganské reunion?
Just a meeting with the players was great.
Man had revived the stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience, not only for the fans, but also for our hockey players.
However, the most important was a tribute to Ivan Hlinkovi.
And it is good to remind people of the history of our game and that leaves one generation that really stood for it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimir Ruzicka and Peter Čechmánek on the bench.
He could still recall his first representative game?
Such things is not forgotten.
It was against the Calgary Flames and the three young: I, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we got in a threesome.
For all it was the first entertainment start.
But that we dominated in some way, so it is impossible to say.
After a long time in Jihlava catching Dominik Hašek.
What did you say to his performance?
Never surprises me Hašan on the ice.
I wanted to bring it back to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticised Jágra for the reasons why he decided to end in entertainment) .Zachytal just fine.
Even Hnilička is brilliantly demonstrated.
While he was practicing with me one night and there was full of holes.
And now catching famózně.

The genetic disorders are often poorly diagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how many years after the wrong diagnosis thought she would die.
After she was diagnosed with a disease, Karin Rodgersová spent most of the teenager in the belief that there is only a few years of her life.
In fact, it was a Charcot has proved-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that affect the nerves outside the brain and spine.
Charities CMT UK said that a bad diagnosis is between people with CMT common problem because of illness, he knows very little.
It is believed that, in the UK suffer from CMT approximately 23 000 people, which may be in the motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, clumsy gait and gnarled toes.
Disabled people also may occur in the numbness or pain, this situation is neléčitelný and progressive, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgersové was thirteen, she thought to suffer from Freidreichovou ataxia (FA) - a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that to celebrate your 18th birthday, she was in a wheelchair, and the dead before she was 30.
The mother of two children who is now 51, says: "As a child, I knew that I can't do the same thing as the others.
Every day I fell and it took me longer.
I could never ride with other children on roller skates or on a skateboard and at school I was victimised because of how I went out and ran. "
When she was thirteen and Rodgersové after several operations to break her Achilles tendon and straighten his feet, took advantage of the fact that her doctor left the room and peered into their documentation, where she learned that suffers from the FA.
"I felt guilty because I snuck around, and so I didn't tell anybody, but when I returned home, I sought information about the disease in the library, and I wrote to the FA," he says.
When I responded, I was in shock, I was completely panicked.
I thought before I was 18, I end up in a wheelchair, and by the time I was twenty-five, I will be dead, and in the meantime gradually lose all their skills.
I was all alone and I was planning a funeral. "
When she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk, does not deteriorate as much as expected, and asked for his surgeon.
Just stood up, hugged her and said: "Honey, I don't think you have the disease, otherwise you would have been in a wheelchair.
I think it will be something far less life-threatening. "
After the completion of a number of genetic tests revealed that he has the CMT.
"When I explained what the CMT is, I thought I was a lucky guy," she said.
Charities CMT UK launched a month awareness of the CMT, to draw attention to the disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington area, with a turnover of the economy, raising taxes
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And the higher taxes.
According to a new survey, which was published last week, state and local taxation of companies in the country to accelerate the recovery of the economy grew slightly last year and the firms in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia together for fiscal year 2013 to state and local coffers took 27.6 billion dollars, which is the amount of 3.8% higher than the $26.6 billion in 2012.
The tax burden - national and local - the last year rose by 4.3% to $671 billion compared with 3.9% last year, and it was the third consecutive year of growth for the years 2009 and 2010, when the tax was reduced.
According to a study conducted by the firm Ernst & Young, the professional and political groupings Center on State Taxation, the state tax increase faster by 4.3%, rather than the local charges of 3.9%.
More than half of the tax revenue Precinct, 56% of the business tax, and 36% of Maryland's income from the company.
Virginia, with 28%, shows proportionately the smallest tax revenue from the business.
The researchers say that a majority share of the growth of tax revenue comes from an increase in the value of the property belonging to the companies, which property taxes this year after three consecutive years, with the growth of -1% increased by 3.7%.
Although most of the profit comes from large states such as California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same situation is also in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginii last year paid over ten billion dollars in state and local property taxes, which compared to 9.6 billion in 2012 represents an annual increase of 4.2%.
However, the apparent increase in the value of the properties so many nevyhání up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the property tax represents less than one fifth of the company taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C. property taxes, which represents almost half of state and local taxes.
"In Maryland owns a lot of real estate firms, particularly the tax base in the vicinity of D.C., the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So, Maryland is forced to rely much more on income tax, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenue from the business cannot be attributed only uzdravujícímu, the real estate market.
According to the data, it appears that the revenue from the business will also increase.
Companies in the region to publish corporate income tax of 2.3 billion dollars, which has increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland on corporate income taxes chosen one billion dollars, the most in the region.
Although the move in the same direction, the local tax burden on business is not growing as fast in these three places.
The rate of growth in D.C. was at the level of the national average, at 4.3%, while the growth of Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was an increase in taxation below average, at 4.1%.
Virginia has from all three circuits (all of which have the same taxation) is the lowest corporate income taxation, 6%.
Corporate tax rates in Maryland is 8.25%, while the average D.C. remains relatively high, at 9,975%.
A similar study this year by the American Chamber of Commerce, showed that Virginia has a lower state and local taxation and generally more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. study did not qualify.
Despite this advantage of Virginia is facing pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing the corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year, the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state in the coming year will continue to meet revenue targets, could be in 2017 statutory income tax rate reduced to 3%.
According to a recent study by the small businesses in Washington is doing better, and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
The trade tax levied by small entrepreneurs such as personal income tax - the structure of compensation cost increases by raising prices, according to which the majority of companies - is organised in D.C., Maryland and Virginia last year increased by 20% to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and national business tax increases are likely to continue next year, the total tax revenues from the sale of state and local governments, as compared to the same period last year, the first three quarters of 2014 will increase to 6.2%.
Washington, however, may lag behind the others, because the reduction of public spending is taking its toll on the labour market.

The family now since international 'Joan: "Fingers crossed"

"Thank you for your love and support," Melissa Rivers said in today's statement.
We are keeping her.
Her mother brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a telephone call to the emergency services, which have been cardiac arrest at yorkwillské endoscopy in the Upper East Side, as stated by the source.
Doctors deliberately keeping her sedated and under close supervision until they were sure of her condition, which remains "serious."
The reaction to wait for leading orchestras, including incredible support on the Internet from figures such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
The reality is překrucovaná headlines
The media with headlines that distort reality, there is no news (unfortunately).
I know that the headlines "sell" newspaper, but unfortunately, I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And it is a fact that worries me very recently, it is probably a better word.
This concerns in particular the articles about the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines are quite normal "Israel attacked Gaza."
It was only in the text to read that Israel's "attack" was a response to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, and often during the cease-fire.
It was then discovered the headline "Both sides have violated the ceasefire."
Recognises the journalistic community that this procedure was directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that throughout Europe (and not only there) are on the rise?
Less than sixty years since the end of World War II.
People are still living survivors of the Shoah.
When I saw the video of the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted slogans of "Jewish scum" and similar things imprinted, I discovered.
It wants the world to finish what went wrong Hitler?
Our journalists are aware of the fact that, after the Jews were destined to liquidate the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please pay a little more care of their work.
You are often referred to as "watchdogs of democracy."
Her obhajujte.
As long as there is.
And also the right obhajujte a truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you want to maintain our government, if one of our neighbours decided that the Czech nation and the Czech Republic will wipe it off the map of the world?
Maybe you should also remember one more fact.
On the territory of the State of Israel is almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship.
And they are right there.
If you ask them why they don't go between "their" need to Gaza, the answer you, why would they do that?
They have a job in Israel, social security and health care (I have seen with my own eyes how to high-end private hospital Hadassa, which is funded by sponsorship of Jews from around the world, normally goes and the Arabs and, of course, there are treated).
Hamas with its missile attacks on its Arab brothers.
The only real assistance to Gaza, and thus the turbulent region, it is to get rid of Hamas and disarm him.
And not to condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in the headlines.
Posted on the practices of Hamas, the abuse of people as human shields.
Tell that Hamas is designed to destroy the state of Israel, and at any price.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Tell that Hamas is on the list of the world's terrorist organizations.
Tell that, after nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could be a thriving thanks to humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even in Israel, which supplies water and electricity to the Gaza Strip, however, does not apply, and even frustrated that they are at this time of power supply occasionally interrupted.
If Hamas does not invest the money in the construction of underground tunnels to penetrate suicide attackers on the territory of Israel, but to be in the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals and schools, lived his Arab brothers from Gaza considerably better.
Amazon buys for 1.04 billion dollars twitch
Amazon has just confirmed the Information on Monday morning: Online retailer - the producer of videos and hundreds of other things - buys for 1.04 billion dollars (970 million US dollars) video streamingovou service twitch.
The announcement caused surprise not because no one expected that someone buys a twitch, but because it was expected that the buyer will be YouTube.
Three months ago, he looked sale Twitche Google for one billion, and this seemed like a natural.
Twitch, who only three years ago, Justin.tv, he was primed to become widely used video streamingovou service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for the player, who was sent to her online coverage of the games - the words of Business Insider "YouTube to broadcast games."
Interaface Twitche.
There are already popular on YouTube videos of "Let's play," a type of where mudrlanti (mostly older) give games processing of Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube when popisuTwitche comes up a lot, so the news that YouTube kupujeTwitch, so did not excite anyone, it was a textbook example of how the company pays the potential competition.
A mystery is why the agreement with YouTube came out, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as the Amazon.
All that is currently available to us, is the expression of CEO Twitche Emmet Sheara: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our society, it has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us meet it faster."
Another mystery is - frankly - an incredible success Twitche.
For snobs like me, who argue that they are doing rather than watching sport, it is hard to understand what's so special about it, instead of the actual playing games just to watch.
It is one thing to look at three in the morning, a friend over his shoulder as he plays Resident Evil, and quite another thing to watch a stranger to get 20 hits to the head in the Call of Duty.
All of the games that you can watch.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so look at their record without themselves could control the perspective, it is quite a good recipe, how to get headaches.
I admit that the game-speed run in which Rogeři Bannisteři our electronic age will complete the game in record time, it is amusing.
But if someone is not a master of playing or humor, his channel on Twitch is unlikely to be very interesting.
But what about the sceptics like me know?
Twitch had 55 million visits a month and is the fourth at the top of the Internet traffic.
Exactly how the Amazon will use?
It is hard to imagine that the twitch stir into the Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as if he might have to swallow YouTube.
Twitch but he has something that would like to draw any firm: The hordes of young men who want to advertisers.
As Director Twitche Shear, Amazon and twitch "believes in the future of the Games," and the media aren't reluctant to, even as - gulp - viewers.
The second fundamental lie creationism.
Another Czech translation of the American atheist vloggera Arona Ra.
This time, on the theme of "Holy fonts are God's word."
Accompanied by the original video.
Second base lies creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were drawn up by God and not the actual human authors.
When worshippers were talking about one of the many things that are inconsistent with their religion, often stands in front of us the question: Who are you going to believe?
Alleged the word of God, or the word of a man?
As if the human exploration was entirely trivial in comparison with the authority of what they believe is their doctrine.
But when they say "man," talks about science.
And when reporting on the "word of God," reporting to the myths of the god of registered people.
If there is a really intelligent with tvořitel with some purpose, then it is he who created the fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be him who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to her, and it must be him who added another series of evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things existed?
It seems as if he was trying to tell us something.
People couldn't create any of those things.
But the people can tell stories, fabulovat.
And these were the people who wrote all the texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Each of the supposedly holy teachings of any religion in the world describes itself as drawn up by people, not gods.
The people who were "affected" or "inspired by" with their favorite gods, or need to listen to the dictates of angels, but the lyrics were written by anyone other than mere mortals with some degree of imagination, not angels and not gods.
If there really was a real god, it would have been an integral part of all the gods of all religions, über-galactic a, the ultimate entity of the cosmos.
If being a size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only scripture.
It would be known all over the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because the mere human authors, with such a deal could not be measured.
And people should not blindly trust her, because it would have been a consistent, substantiated by verifiable and truthful evidence, and would have a profound morality and wisdom far beyond any human limits.
Any reader would be permanently inspired to the unity of the common belief.
If the god wrote it, we would expect nothing less.
But what we see instead, it is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion, leading to the ultimate truth, we have a lot of different religions without a common origin, and all were kept apart in the increasingly separate denominations, seeking the truth and each somehow claiming divine leadership, regardless of the ongoing divergence and segregation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Quran, Baha'u 'lláhův Kitab-i-Akdás, Zarathuštrovy Avesta, sikhský order-Granth, Mahabharátská Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or Urantia Book are all considered to be "absolutely right" and "revealed by the word of the true god" and the believers of each of them say that the others are astray.
Probably the only logical explanation is that the people are to some extent, everyone.
None of the above-mentioned books does not have any advantage over others.
None of them has the support and no cannot be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the University in West.
I'm not saying that I proved that the Bible is reliable and historical accuracy.
Of course, it is not.
Still, you must have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologia (defence) because they contain inconsistencies, absurdity and primitive ideas once considered true, which had already been overcome.
So you cannot say that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promotes heinous atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claims that have been confirmed by the fulfilment of a prophecy - with the fact that each can also contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Prominent theologians admit that all of the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and therefore are subject to interpretation, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudices bound politically motivated authors, which explains many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it that contradictions, more mutual comments.
We must once again point out that there are two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some redaktorské revision.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author, and certainly not by telling an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources for the Pentateuch, or Five Books "Mojžíšových" and Moses credited authorship of any of them, because there was almost certainly, as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezdrášem) from several mutually unrelated oral traditions in front of fewer than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered at the same time, and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological discoveries of texts, known for its unfinished basis of all Western monotheistic faiths, and yet there are many centuries younger than the roots of zoroastriánství, Buddhism, Hinduism, helénismu, Druid cults, Chinese and Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as gnostická faith, followed docéti and ebionité and their very different views about Jesus, which will eventually combine in a sort of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups such as luciferiáni were dispersed and discredited other revisions of the Bible.
One of these Ugaritu trim refers to the king, who ruled from 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers represented a fundamental threat to young mojžíšké religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to mock and Ba'al Zebula, "Lord of the Mountain" changed to Beelzebub "Lord of the Flies."
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered, both for religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened was canonized by the New Law in the 4th century AD in a series of decisions on the council in komisních Nikaji.
The four Gospels were adopted and sixteen others were rejected by a simple show of hands, as if the fact some things could accept or reject the vote.
The way in which the canon developed depended on what they read on Sundays in the Christian centers.
What to read on the second Sunday after Easter in Jeruzalemské church?
And what in the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually discovering that are close to the same evangelijním stories.
And so the core of the canon that developed from the wisdom of the Church.
So the council simply accepted as gospel of any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at that time.
But so knowingly removed more than a dozen books of the Bible, even though they cite books that have been approved.
Among the items we find odmítnutými writings as apostles and prophets.
Why would God's word should refer to the books that are just the words of some people and / or not is not available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions the human authors.
But, as this could be approved if God was the real author of this random mixture of reputation, parables and žalmové lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not too osvíceními, rather the contrary!
That is the reason why there is so much of its content historically and scientifically absolutely wrong, whether it is almost anything from beginning to end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys can speak, believed in spells, bloody victims, ritual magic, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology and five elements of magic.
They thought that by using a rod that someone's going to spray blood, he was cured of leprosy.
We are talking about people who thought that rabbits are ruminants and bats are birds and whales are fish and Ms that is a whole number.
These people believed that if they will show a pregnant cow striped patterns, to bear the striped calves.
How could he say that someone who knows something about the genetics?
The authors of this book, of course, didn't know.
If the Bible was written a higher beings, then did not contain such errors, what it contains.
If it came from the pen truly superior beings and was intended as a literal history, then did not contain anything from what it contains.
As a moral guide wholly unsatisfactory because most of the original Hebrew writings were drawn up by ignorant and bigoted savages who ignored or supported the cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, family abuse, child abuse, violence against children, abortion, looting, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudices against race, race, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
In order to defend their inhumanity, claiming that doing God's will.
But the creationists still ignore all of this.
Some of their Web sites to admit that if there is any truth in conflict with the Bible, then it must be ignored.
And why?
Because if creationists did not have their beloved books, they should not even God.
In their world is the second one and the same.
It is ironic that they reject God's "work" as "the worship of the creatures instead of the creator."
But the man regarded themselves as the word of God and God alone and even insist that the rebuttal of their supposedly "Saints" books somehow disproves God as such.
Not their version of the god but all versions of the god.
Kreacionističtí Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then the god lying.
They cannot accept that the god could exist, and at the same time, the Bible could be wrong, because they cannot separate the doctrine of deities.
So it is a kind of idolatry, where believers worship the man-made compilations, as if these books were the god, because they think they are his word.
But God never wrote nediktoval none of the files of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected by their allegedly "constant words" of any god was vymýšleno, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, edited and often also deliberately altered and překrucováno only fallible human beings.

Apple icloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, for the public to get naked pictures of celebrities
A screenshot of the leaked files listing
Meanwhile, an anonymous user on 4chan site publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, pointed out the American site Mashable.com.
It is alleged to have gained unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple's servers, where it is disabled users recorded through automatic backup images from iPhonů and iPadů.
Meanwhile, Apple did not comment on the problem.
Some of the celebrities rejects the pictures as false, but already some of the authenticity of the images.
These include the actress Jennifer Lawrence Katniss known from the title role in the film series of Hunger Games or Mary Elizabeth Winsteadová, who played in the deadly trap 4.0, for example.
The hacker is to use the images and videos for enrichment.

The smart way to save for college textbooks
Given that the price of college textbooks for many students is more than 1,000 dollars a year, the sophomore came up with a clever way to reduce costs.
The system was invented by borrowing books from classmates of the upperclassmen with the offer of a nominal compensation to hold back their divestment.
"The book on the calculations, which normally costs 180 dollars per semester I earned in ten and chicken nuggets," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Books required in his last semester would cost 430 dollars, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the university council will spend an average student for textbooks and supplies more than 1 200 dollars per year, but the students have different options for how to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students are becoming Internet shops and creative solutions such as this Schroederovo.
Lending textbooks is on the rise, which allows students to use the book semester and often at heavily discounted prices than if you bought it.
Neebo Inc operating more than 250 bookstores in the campuses of campuses says that lending books had doubled from 2011.
The survey shows that about a quarter of the books in the university bookstores in the last spring semester borrowed, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts, according to the National Association of university shops in university bookstores buys.
There are 101 of the best ways to succeed.
The online shopping
The prices of some of the new books on the Internet can be up to a third less than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "calculus" Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetlera is nearly 290 dollars, but it is possible on the Internet at Chegg.com, retail specialist at the textbooks, buy a new for 239,99 dollars.
Buy the used
If you don't mind the remarks of other people or wear and destruction, suitable options are used the texts.
Chegg.com, the "calculus" sells for $93,49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a student of higher class at Brigham Young University, says that on Amazon.com bought a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" 42 cents.
The new was sold for $48.
The university lecturer Ingrid Braceyová, Head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls suggests that students in their teachers verify whether they are older edition acceptable.
Sometimes the changes are essential for the work in the workshops.
If so, they can sell for a fraction of the price of the older edition of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, are a popular option for the purchase of used books, eBay Inc. 'S Half.com.
Lending of
Also under consideration is půjčovaní textbooks, if you treat it well with them, you have not forgotten them back and you don't need to have them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the costs for a new book.
Student, for example, would be able to borrow the entire semester "calculus" for about twenty dollars.
Meet the terms of trade, in which you lend the book, including penalties for the remarks, highlighting or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If the book back in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to procure books instead of the normal e-book.
Sometimes, these books essentially lend in the form of electronic licences valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends "calculus" for six months for approximately 61 dollars.
According to Braceyové so they can find the best offer students of literary courses, because many of the classics is now available for download for free, while the scientific and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, walk at the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon enter the Pepperdine Law School, advised to follow the ISBN because it ensures that you buy the right book.
Before you book ordered over the Internet, make sure it is really warehouse, advises Gault.
He persuaded it on his own skin.
The book had been sold out for four weeks, and had to pay the full price for a book from the university bookstore.
The mud, the same mud.
And then they found in the remains of the rifle from the end of the war
The well is not far from the church of St George.
We uncovered stands around and we started to pull the ancient silt - roughly five feet of mud and rotting leaves.
As we approached the jílovitému bottom, we ran into the barrel, "said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it, cleaned and found that it is the torso of a German assault rifle used by the SS.
The decision is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such guns produced up towards the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand, "Smith said.
All of the wooden design things will decompose over time, so it is useless.
However, her body is preserved - holds its shape.
The left in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe they threw her out there, people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS, probably out of fear that they were relegated.
Guys on the run would be likely to do.
They threw away their weapons in the woods, "she thinks the finder.
The rifle was the only thing that enthusiasts from Hnutí Duha Jeseníky found in the well.
"There could be a hand grenades, those that had been around a lot, so we slowed excavation, we thoroughly palped mud, so that it is not a disaster, but there was nothing else down there," Smith said.
The findings will end up in the depositary of the museum at the castle in nearby Slezských Rudolticích.
The Ukrainian general: I've captured Čecha neosvobozoval
An exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz. General-Colonel Bondarenko Volodymyrem Rubanem, which exempts Ukrainian troops from the pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev / Prague - "Excuse me, I have to take it... call me from the Donetsk start," he apologized perhaps eight times in an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz. Ukrainian the General Volodymyr Ruban, also the director of the Center for the liberation of prisoners of war.
The General Volodymyr Ruban in a televised debate.
In any such suspension was impossible not to hear the names of people, their numbers or where they are - or should be - that Ruban clarifies with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"That's it - you go out there," said one of the series of discussions with Doněckem and had returned to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests at Majdanu.
Yesterday, when we discussed the interview - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the pro-Russian separatists is dedicated to twenty-four hours a day.
Aktuálně.cz: Maybe you know that, on the side of the pro-Russian separatists are fighting the Czechs.
Our counterintelligence estimated their number to 30.
However, there may be a lot more.
Have you with a Czech prisoner in your negotiations met?
Volodymyr Ruban: I've already freed captured Serbs, Dagestánce, Chechens, one Swede, Olivier Georgians... but not yet.
But I know whom to turn in Prague, if we ran into your captive compatriot and were able to rescue him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
What do you advise the Czechs, who are added to the proruským separatists and Ukrainian soldiers is captured?
They should understand that if, as the Czechs are fighting in the Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and separatists is captured, they would shoot them after questioning without mercy, as well as any other foreigners.
Separatists consider these men for rent mercenaries and they have nothing to them does not deserve nothing less than death.
But if, for example, a group of Ukrainian soldiers captured doněckých separatists - and thus be between them and the Czechs - and put him behind bars and deal with him as a prisoner of war.
The guy simply survive.
The Ukrainian side behaves in the war as a state.
A.cz: And how much you have managed to save the Ukrainian prisoners?
I understand it, in exchange.
Some sources indicate that it exceeded a hundred men.
We have long since stopped counting how many people we help.
We just freed them... but they didn't save before the war, if they decide to continue in the fighting.
Rescuers are in the war, doctors, surgeons, but we certainly not.
It is.
And every day we have more and more.
Every day we will save someone.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And does not always go on the exchange.
Sometimes just for the release of prisoners and a mere human plea.
A.cz: It is rumored that you get in a few months with the pro-Russian separatists great authority and even confidence... as well as in the Ukrainian company.
How did you manage to build the respect of both sides?
Heavy question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname of "mad general with steel balls."
It does not offend me.
And maybe it also captures the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian officer corps, I had some authority here before.
He never nechytračím, cheat and I have always word.
Whatever happens, I'm honestly and I speak the truth.
Even if it is the Ukrainian government, or the luhanské doněcké or very unpleasant.
If torturing and killing people?
So they simply say that it is torturing and killing.
And that they are crimes.
Often, I'm risking my life, even for the exchange of prisoners and captured me... this job for me at any time can mean the end... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and torture of prisoners, you know?
... (Long pause)... to the torture of prisoners during interrogations resort Ukrainians and the separatists.
Unfortunately,.
And executions?
These are just the doněcké side.
The fact that the Ukrainian army also executes prisoners, I have no information.
Even indications that the Ukrainian army perpetrated something similar.
The number of executions, we have an idea, but I can't and don't want to give numbers.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of pro-Russian separatists.
Officers are among them, but also the veterans of Afghanistan.
It seeks to autonomy and perhaps even democracy in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - or so they say.
They do not want any more to play games with the Ukrainian oligarchs.
The separatists are already tired of oligarchs and their implacable opponents - a life-and-death.
As we say - přejedli them up to the throat.
The same dreams and aspirations of the people, by the way, they show to Majdanu.
And now, a little zaspekuluji: Russia supports the separatists and the West, the Ukrainian state.
Speculation is a big one and the other, on the contrary, a little.
This was my sentence but the irreconcilable contradiction.
How are you, for example, appears to be one of the hardest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists Igor Bezler?
Always when crossing the line of the war, I am unarmed and I show soldiers or militants has spread bare hands.
And I always have both sides of the two hundred or three hundred meters in my sights or in optical sights.
The faces of the people who are headed for me, every time I see well... and they can always pull the trigger of his weapon.
The trooper, a colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
It is considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small governorates in the Russian empire.
In any case, constantly talking about it and Ukraine is considered a kind of the misunderstanding.
Such a state would not exist, according to him.
At the same time, is the sworn enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in the Ukrainian television news show you your Prime Minister Arsenije Jaceňuka described as weak, helpless and tired "leader" who would do better if left quickly.
During the three hundred meters of walking will always fear at least five times.
Why should I hide, then, with the view that the sign is a very weak prime minister and that is bad for our country?
A.cz: You share of the war in Ukraine?
Maybe you know that Ukrainians Jaceňuka called the "rabbit."
And the rabbit is not in the eyes of Ukrainians animal from which would fear or should go for other respect and authority.
His behaviour directly mimics the behavior of a rabbit.
Maybe it is a good economist, but as prime minister in the war does not have the right to cry in the parliament, asking him to play with him his intrigue, threatening to ask function... he has to govern the country, manage it, and even in times of war to protect.
The threat to the country's prime minister is not entitled to family, friends, resting on a whining emotions.
He was the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
And sign?
He behaves like a teenage girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he was never strong... fights for Ukraine, but he constantly complaining at all.
He should therefore leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save sales
Expendable 3 Sylvester Stallonea returned from devadesátimilionového budget in the US for less than 30 million dollars and Sin City: A woman for whom I would kill back with its 70 million budget of just 12 million.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz during the first weekend earned only 14.6 million dollars, as well as films for children like How to Train Your Dragon 2 were disappointing for the cinema.
According to an article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collina is what the children's movies, the quality of their guilt.
By Collin described 2014 as the "worst" year of children's films and How to Train Your Dragon 2, called a "functional" continuation.

In July, compared the Entertainment Weekly servers CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average rating of summer movie premieres posted in at least 2,000 theaters in the period between Memorial Day and July 20 in 2013 and this year.

According to some commentators may be due to a change in the approach of viewers and the increased popularity of web sites such as Netflix has gone.
The director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on the processing of Disney's Jungle Book, the Hollywood Reporter website said: "I think that times are changing."
We have to admit it and try to chase what it was.
In contrast to the current crisis Hollywood briefs reached Netflix profit thanks to the internet services of 1.2 billion dollars, which is almost twice as much as last year's 837 million dollars.
Last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the study for not rely too much on the rights of the cartoons, and predicted the "collapse" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that, at its catastrophic prophecy may be something.
With the possible major briefs in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoňů and Jurassic World, other figures in the film industry are more optimistic.
The X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in revenues as simply "cyclical." For the Hollywood Reporter said: "The next summer will be the biggest briefs in the history of the summer, and no one will have to worry about selling."

Olomouc brought from Opava only point win on his leg Vašíček
Just 23-year-old forward could decide in the two largest chances but failed.
After the score called mainly shot from close range three minutes before the end, instead of in the network but ended up on the keeper Opava Josef Květoňovi.
I had it on my leg, I have to give a chance.
I'm angry at myself, "he took Vašíček ashes on his head.
"I guess I should give up under the lid, it drove me a little bit," he mused.
Sigma Defenzíva of Opava power to allow the exception was Mikulův raid from the 11th minute, but goalkeeper Reichl covered.
Then he began to push Hanáci, but the chance is in the block to prevent domestic leopards and missiles from a distance running Kveton.
Fifteen minutes later, we were making, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from the standard situations.
But the sheer chance Vašíček turn, and so it ended 0-0, "regretted coach Hanáků Leos Kalvodu.
Opava section was taken because of the absences in the assembly, where, in addition to a pair of injuries were missing and Peter Vavřík, concludes with třígólovým shooter Peter Ševčíkem, who host of Sigma in Silesia.
The them, unlike its earlier policy did not start.
Alternates deserves the discharge.
Sigma was fotbalověji, but except for one standardku we wouldn't let her to do anything, "said coach Peter Baránek Silesians.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and militancy.
A draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us, "he added.
Sigma got a draw on four points, which means the 13th place.
Anything that might satisfy the club chief Joseph Lébra, who after the slaughter, Znojmo surrendered his rat contribution to the vastly different performances in other games.
"We recognized the warning of Mr Lébra, so it cannot be said that the boys did not want to fight," he noted Kalvoda and to address a sleeper shooter Vašíčka added: "I believe it will come and give up a goal, so it starts to fall.
But after the first strike, relieve him immediately to conserve and goals for the next matches, "laughed Kalvoda.
Al Pacino twice enthused Venice.
Otherwise the film festival is experiencing a crisis
After a huge enthusiasm over the opening film of the Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu was ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next day suggested the impression that the interest in the 71st edition of the festival in Venice somewhat subsided.
Whether because of the number of seats in the largest room was increased to fourteen hundred, or because they followed criticism after Birdmanovi acknowledged, but for the spectators less attractive photos as a document of genocide in Indonesia 1960s Look of silence and other films with social issues, from the American 99 homes after the Iranian Stories, in cinemas simply remained empty seats.
Heroes of the comic
Even the red carpet in front of the palace festivalovým neobléhaly crowds, such as in the past, and reportedly ceased to be a problem to find a place in the hotel at the last minute.
He talks about the crisis in Italy more than anywhere else, and it is not surprising that even so revered institutions like the Biennale, the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis shows a lack of personalities, however, present only in the context of the films.
While the younger fans yearned for autogramech representatives of Michael Shannon's comic superheroes and Andrew Garfield, who in 99 homes quite successfully undertaken dramatic roles, for all generations without distinction became the main events of the visit of the legendary actor Al Pacino.
Moreover, flared up here in two movies.
In the story of enlightenment placed outside the competition, which drew atmosphere Barry Levison, according to Philip Roth novel, Pacino's profane role, which is close to him: The actor at the top of the glory, who suffer from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But to see him the next day as the crotchety owner of a hardware store in the rural town of Manglehorn in the movie, which was directed by David Gordon Green, it was really an unforgettable experience.
Volpiho Cup for best actor would not miss him - but is still an artist Pacinova format needed prices?
Perhaps it is the greatest satisfaction for the love of the audience, and the Italian especially because, although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly to the country from which they come to his grandparents.
Points for Italy
Indeed, the Italian film this year is very well in Venice.
The black souls who directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first picture after Birdmanovi odměněným long a standing ovation.
Kalábrijská branch of the Mafia is viewed in view of family relationships between the clans, which are fighting each other for power and money, and the director was able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good movie: High-quality scenario, camera, music and actor.
Also took heart chamber psychothriller Hladová, who filmed Saverio Costanzo with Albou Rohrwacherovou in the role of a woman who kills his misguided anxiety about her own child.
Conversely, the French competing films, pending a warm welcome nor ransom for glory, nor the three hearts, both works clinging to the traditional model of films based on the popularity of the leaders.
But, after all, two really good movies, namely the Birdman and Black souls, are not so little in the first half of the festival.
And though the festival films are generally depressing suggestions, a new picture of Peter Bogdanoviche named "She's Funny That Way, absurdist comedy in Venice outside competition and filmed in the style of American veseloher 40 years, was able to lift the mood for more than one day.

The Czech Republic has few universally educated people and, moreover, statistics show that gymnazisté have good exercise.
The beginning of the school year is here.
In schools in the last fortnight were a great preparation.
Most are routine matters, such as the need to bring the pot of summer storage back to classes and people chalk.

"The French socialists should shut up and give France in order," says the key ally Francois Hollande
Valls calls on the highly fragmented left "to show their support for the" belligerent naladěnému socialist president, whose reshuffling did not meet with the approval of the majority of French people.
The president deserves the respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our obligation is to stay at his side," he said, earning applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government will not call into question the controversial French třicetipětihodinový working week despite a passionate argument by Emmanuel Macrona, the new finance minister, who earlier this week suggested that the rules relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain "consistent" with the government.
Christiane Taubirová, Minister of Justice, but he did, when she appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs, where the Socialist Party criticised for not because of her "the French people have lost faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, lídryně extremely conservative Right, the constant internal disputes between the socialists have laughed when she said that he did not expect the new government Vallsova last longer than a few months.
The Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls, too, were forced to form a new government after the previous couldn't last until the end of the summer.
"And the new lasts until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told his supporters.

Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French will soon patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"This is a limited scope for the opportunity, but public opinion must think there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art, Prague in the elections do not restrict
The changes of the relevant regulations should prepare and approve the new leadership to the capital.
From the streets of Prague will not disappear before local elections next casinos and the city will not restrict the street art.
Even walking dogs will not be limited.
Prague misses in last October's elections to prepare and approve the changes in the representation of the relevant regulations.
"The decision on the changes, moreover, would not make the current leadership of the city, whose mandate ends in a few weeks," said Councillor Lukas Manhart (TOP 09).
Annul the board gamble on its territory in recent weeks has decided to just a few city halls, for example, Prague 5 and 7.
But the casinos will not disappear, the decree on gambling, meanwhile, will not change.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the election.

Last week, placed the victory proponentům Scottish independence at hand
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger that will make this mistake this time, when he placed on billboards throughout Scotland, the question of whether the Scots want to be rich.
But you won't get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, or gain their respect, when you start to threaten them.
The morale of the New Testament in Scotland is still alive, although few Scots still goes to church, even today.
The Scots have a much greater tendency to oust the money changers from the temple to let them dictate how to vote.
The boss of the Scottish Nationalists Alex Salmond knows this, and therefore in a television debate has repeatedly questioned his opponent, Unioner Darling, whether it is willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence, and start to promote the single currency for Scotland and for England.
That Darling forced to choose between the Scottish civil society and the London financiers, and with a grimace fell into this trap.
Of course, that Darling will not support the mandate of the Scottish voters.
But the debate about how Scotland will have the currency, was already more or less neutralised.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, jobs and the defence of public health services that citizens are free.
Darling on currency was supported by the London banker and also created the impression that it will not protest against the privatisation of health.
Thus, as Salmond said, "got into bed with the Tories."
It is very dangerous for any Scottish policy positions.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with the Tories.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland, not to voters, but to the "bosses" to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to discuss the independence of the Scottish Premier Salmondem for the unionist campaign was a serious mistake.
Cameron just looks like a cowardly absentující home.
The Scots would have respected him, had come to the debate with the Scottish prime minister.
Cameron could even say that Scotland can be a "successful independent country."
Alistair Darling couldn't say anything like that, it operates almost physical pain.
What it says is clear: The Scots did not jump out and they must accept what it is.

Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong the day after the decision to provoke the Chinese authorities vote
Stood near a group of people loyal to Beijing, waving the Chinese flag.
The permanent committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday agreed to elections in 2017 in Hong Kong, participated in only two of the three candidates.
All candidates must first get the support of the nominating committee, which will probably consist of members loyal to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballots and encourage pro-democracy activists to restore the promise and cripple the financial centre of Hong Kong protests movements "hour limb."
Political reform in Hong Kong is the main reason for the tension, Chinese leaders are concerned that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing in June, has published a detailed report outlining the Chinese official power in Hong Kong, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the ballot in the special administrative area and hundreds of thousands of people they marched into the city's business district and occupied it.
The press conference, which will be Prime Minister Li, organized by the government in Hong Kong and China's liaison office in Hong Kong.

Student activists said that the afternoon will gather in front of the offices of the government of Hong Kong.

Putin wants Kiev to eastern Ukraine started negotiations on the "national sovereignty"
According to the description of events by Russian newspapers on Sunday asked Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Ukrainian government stopped the fight with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "national sovereignty" of the breakaway regions.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin's endorsement did not intend to imply that the area of eastern Ukraine controlled by the separatists will become part of Russia, but that their status as part of Ukraine should be reassessed to Russian-speaking region has the power to protect their rights and interests.
Putin's challenge of the Kiev government to negotiate with the rebels proruskými as equals, corresponds to a clear strategy, according to which governs from riots five months ago: Help separatists to occupy the territory and make the Ukrainian government to grant the newly opened Novorusku de facto independence to take place with the West could join with Russia.
In an interview with the state television channel Putin condemned the Ukrainian military action to regain the eastern region of Donetsk start and Luhansk regions, which in March and April, the separatists after Moscow annexed Crimean peninsula on March 18, belonging to Ukraine.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently occupied territory have described as "Novorusko" or "New Russia," a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian empire.
The Russian news agency Itar-Tass published by Putin's words, according to which it is a "prisoner of illusions" anyone who believes that the peace negotiations are on the horizon, because the Ukrainian politicians have launched before the parliamentary elections on October 26 campaign, while the government forces are attacking civilians in areas controlled by the separatists.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately initiate meaningful negotiations and not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the status of the national sovereignty of the southeast of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's allusion to state sovereignty has been given in the context of a broader autonomy, which is already with the leadership of Kiev for several months and which has alleviated fears of Russian-speaking regions of the threat to the cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that the autonomy can only grant the eastern areas of the Ukrainian government.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin's intervention spokesman, which should be corrected "incorrect interpretation" of Putin's comments highlighted Russia's leadership approach to resolve the separatist rebellion in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the population 2,000,000MK origins among ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had much more trouble to annex the Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are Russians and opinion polls, which were held before the conflict, showed broad support for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats acted in international forums, regional governments in Ukraine would be given the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and effectively put the Kremlin de facto control over the territory, which would join the Russian mainland with Krymem.
The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago, is a key Russian naval fleet, maritime business background and the historic coastal resort.
The area between Russia's Rostov-and Krymem are also the centre of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Porošenko during its inaugural speech on 7 June suggested that Ukrainian lawmakers - for new elections - to consider changes in the constitution that would have given the disparate regions more control over their finances and linguistic status.
This vision of autonomy, but very different from the vision of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and instigating violence.
Putin's last call to Kiev had acted with the separatists as equals, followed by the rebels last week after the eastern Ukraine penetrated Russian troops and tanks from the previously peaceful areas along the Azov Sea.
Separatists boosted by the Russians took control of Novoazovskem with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to occupy the strategic coastal territory in Crimea.
It precipitated a huge civilian and military efforts to fortify Mariupol, a port in the metallurgy plants about 500 000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovskem and narrow gateway to the Crimean peninsula.
Porošenko on Saturday spoke at the meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that is independent of the last 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return," warned Porošenko.
On the territory of Ukraine is now thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks.
The EU summit has made no definitive steps - leaders called for further sanctions against Russia in the case of unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday, Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsku after last week, two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units doněcké filtered into the area to support the beleaguered separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilovajsku during the Russian invasion, on Sunday were traded for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.

Although from Opava eventually brought only a point behind bezbrankovou Draw.
And the militancy of his club boss a little udobřili.
The money to pay the club could come soon.
"I'll take one more game, as I discussed last week, but I'm far more optimistic," said Lébr that, despite the fact that the Sigma didn't win, the players have improved performance.
Militancy and commitment with which we played mainly in the second half, it was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In this case, I am able to forgive that wins.
If we were playing from the beginning of the season, so I believe that we have not lost, "she thinks Lébr.
Sigma in Opava has withstood the initial domestic pressure, then the game and in the second half was better.
After the victory of Kalvodovi charges have picked up, but they did not make a field goal of their options, and so they could not win.
Although the result is not in our ideas.
We lacked a complete satisfaction but only one transformed by chance, "said Lébr, but does not think that the change in the approach of footballers just his threat.
There were certainly more aspects.
From my side, from the coach, or the fans, "said Lébr.
With the pressure of Sigma must count
The players after the game in Opava events of last week did not want to comment too much.
I am trying to put these things completely gone.
I tried to keep up, "said the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl.
Without comment, leaving the question of Lébrova statement last week the attacker Václav Vašíček, who turn the greatest opportunity of Sigma in Saturday's game.
Finally, but a little bit of pressure on him.
We will still under pressure.
All of us want to pull out.
Today, we have shown that when we fight and ride all over your ass, so it goes, "he said.
The warning took to heart
Neither coach Leoš Kalvoda pretend preparation for the game was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the guys realize it, and today was a warning of Mr Lébra took to heart.
Although even before it was that they didn't want to fight and they cheated, "said Olomouc coach.
It was similar to the first fifteen minutes today.
It took to match hardness and realize what the league is.
It is not just about fotbalovosti, but mainly about the militancy, "said Kalvoda.
We can only hope that in the next few games that Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I'd like to believe it," he added.
