Peter, it is possible that during the remaining few hours to change the Jersey?
I don't count, but in football nothing is 100%.
During the day will come that will not reject the offer.
How would such an offer would have to look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know how such an offer you cannot refuse it, actually looks like.
It would lead to compliance of all parties in particular would depend on the position of Chelsea, if any offer the Club solved or not.
It is not technically feasible to make such a change, if you're in Prague?
There would be no need to somewhere in the new workplace, if any new contract signed?
So I thought.
But in such a situation is a lot of players today, they are all somewhere on the ceremonial gatherings and I'm sure a lot of players closes today.
So, somehow, it would certainly be feasible.
How many clubs on the planet, which would you afford?
Well, I don't really know.
And you therefore to leave netlačíte?
When I'm in the first three games of the new season picked up, is for me a new career after fifteen years.
However, there is no reason to panic, to pack up and go somewhere.
I want to fight for the position of goalkeeper, Chelsea continue to participate and is on the coach, who chooses what kind of decisions in the course of the following weeks will do.
What role does family play in your decision making?
Taking into account all the factors.
It is essential for me, of course, the sports aspect, but I look at it from a personal page in which the needs of the family, of course, belongs to.
It is possible that you fielded for another Club in England?
This is a question about which I thought that I will never be.
But in football anything is possible.
I don't want to exclude anything.
I don't know the answer.

Restoring the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Kongresmeni Keith Ellison and John Lewis have suggested a law that is organizing a Union to protect as a civil right.
"Depending on how the trade unions, work jobs for the middle class," says Ellison, Democratic Senator for Minnesotu, which is the spolupředsedající Congress Committee.
Therefore, I am so proud that I, together with the model of the occasional rights John Lewis to introduce the law, strengthening the position of the employees.
This groundbreaking legislation gives workers the same legal options, how to prevent discrimination in the Organization of trade unions, as with other forms of discrimination-and stops the protiodborové forces
Modify the law on labour relations, so as to enable all employees, who face discrimination, if they want to participate in trade unions, judge at the Court of session-and not in the compensation or damages-is correct and necessary initiative.
I'm sure that's not a radical initiative-at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other petitioners in the present, is reestablished on the American ideal.
Despite the trade fight, which took place in recent years in Wisconsin, Michigan and other States-Americans once supported the countries around the world to take, to extend and to respect labor rights.
There was a time, and millions of Americans is still remember when the country in the same breath promote democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to Assembly.
When the United States after World War II occupied Japan, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt the Constitution designed to ensure that military autocracy Hideki Toja will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that the employees and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, to include the language in them and openly acknowledged that "the right of employees to bargain collectively, to collect and act it is guaranteed."
When the United States after World War II occupied Germany, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to produce a Constitution that will ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism will be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans were aware that employees will be in the new nation need to organize and promote and, therefore, included a clause that openly says: "the right to create associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions of each individual and each occupation or profession, guaranteed.
The arrangement, which will restrict this right or to seek its damage will be cancelled. Measures leading to the fulfilment of this purpose are illegal.
When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission for human rights, which has proposed a Universal Declaration of human rights, which was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, to include the appellants and Roosevelt that guarantee, "everyone has the right under the protection of their interests to create trade unions and to join them."
An entire generation of Americans can receive a basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries, how to create a civil and democratic society, explained to the Americans, that the right to create trade unions work-and their participation in collective negotiations with the companies and Government agencies in the position of an equal partner-must be protected.
Now when these rights are under assault in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal, that the working people shall have the right in a free and open society to organize and promote.
As fifty years ago, said the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the strength of the nation narrowed the trade unions, but expanded it.
Increased the standard of living of millions of people have created a market for industry and production increased to an unprecedented level.
Those who attack the unions, these simple truths forget history is to remember.
History does not forget, and we also shouldn't.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human-and the extension of the protection of civil rights, so as to prevent discrimination in the organizing of trade unions-has a large delay.
Keith Ellison, and John Lewis, renewing the ideals that have lifted America and made it a real commitment to democracy.
A judge temporarily blocked the law, which could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge temporarily blocked Sunday, the Louisiana law, which, according to the lawyers probably closed all five clinics performing abortions in the State.
Regulation enacted by signing Bobby's work for the Governor of Jindala in June, which has entered into force, enter 1. in September, after the doctors performing abortions require in order to have the right to take the patient to the hospital within 30 miles from the performance of their practice.
The resolution of the judge means that doctors can temporarily in the implementation of legal abortions continue, and meanwhile, you must obtain this permit.

Rights activists on the abortion resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, and said that doctors will provide more time to obtain the authorisation.
"Today's decision provides women in Louisiana, that they will be safe from malicious act, which is to prepare health and their rights," said Nancy Northupová, President and Executive Director of the Center for reproductive rights on behalf of three of the five clinics to sue demanded blocking the law.
Was not immediately clear whether the decision applies to physicians from two clinics that were made between by the complainant, and also asking for the grant of such authorization.
Louisiana is among the 11 States that have approved similar laws, while the courts in Alabama and Mississippi, such measures the provisions declared unconstitutional.
The key part of a Texas law that would have most of the remaining clinics in the State to block a federal judge on Friday.
Campaigners for women's rights to abortion, along with the American Association of Obstetricians and gynecologists and the American Medical Association argues that the need to have this authorization puts on physician requirements that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion oppose measures that aim to protect the health of women, and some also welcomed the fact that the measure would be the clinic closed.
The Center for reproductive rights said that Louisiana has a permit only one the doctor performing the abortion.
If all doctors in the State were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would fear for their safety, also stopped to perform the surgery, said the group.
Louisiana authorities in response stated that it would netrestaly the doctor who performed abortions, while waiting for the execution of the request for the grant of rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment kills the countryside ovarian cancer more often
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video with his deceased mother, holdem, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women on the Australian countryside, there is a higher risk to die from cancer of the ovaries, than for their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1100 Australanek diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35% five years after diagnosis were.
Head of research Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, said that women in rural and remote areas of the State was about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
A SMALL STUDY: new drugs can slow lung cancer and ovarian
The researchers followed the women during the seven years of treatment.

The lowest survival rates have occurred in older women, for which she was diagnosed with cancer in advanced stage.
For women in rural and remote areas of the State was about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that the factors can be a late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease can best treat gynekoonkologové, who usually located in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of medical services at a distance, that they have to overcome the barrier of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transport services, which will allow specialists to treat the women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who treats away from your family and friends.
Dr Jordan said that the study revealed that long-term survival in women with ovarian cancer is regardless of geographical location, low, which stresses the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto's Ride to Conquer cancer today will publish a Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, in its 33 years young mother Elisha Neaveová from the city of Gold Coast diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden Center home owners regret the reduction in the number
According to a study published by the HTA, the Financial Times, the decline associated with an extraordinary loss of home owners younger than 35 years could lead to the fact that today's young generation of consumers it reaches "the main age group gardeners", garden centers will come up to about ten million pounds per year.
According to the report they spend for their gardens, people who rent housing, on average, 55% of the amount spent by the people living in his.
As other factors threatening the industry that earns an estimated five billion pounds a year, the increase in the number of people living in urban areas, where there are no garden, popular paving instead perennials are used as parking area and shrinking the size of the gardens.
In the area of greater London, where the proportion of owned homes fell during the six years from 61% to 43%, the lowest spending per household on horticultural products in the uk.

When Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After meeting Putin on its youth organization that reminds me most of all Hitlerjugend, clanked atomic weapons and basically all indicate that their opinions are stolen, he gave us a lecture on democracy.
But I get the feeling that the current regime in Russia has many features of the fascist state.
Great Nations have one thing in common and that is that it is able to take over as forming nationalism, and that an inferiority complex can transform the imperialist appetites.
Time passes on the East differently than in the West.
While the Western world thought that the period of wars for supremacy over Europe is already long gone, to the East, by contrast, thinks that's ignored were already long and need to get back its international position.
Such a mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the grasping power of the Nazis and then was followed by an explosion of nationalism in Russia, today's situation dissimilar.
And then the completely same as the cult of the strong leader, beating up journalists, liquidation of uncomfortable political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, it is thus indeed fairly similar.
Vladimir managed to Putin, and certainly a large part of the Russians will probably miss the time when Russia was half the world, and the second part is shaking in front of them.
I think that Western politicians are guilty themselves, maybe a few Vladimir poplácávali shoulders, maybe they didn't invite him there where he wanted and maybe they underestimated and he just acted like a typical Russian peasants.
He made a tidy home, he looked, that he actually didn't even want to go anywhere and to sharpen the blades at home.
Now decided to reclaim lost positions.
Begin slowly, my time.
The leader is about to life imprisonment, so where would be rushed.
Trampled Kavkazany, now, then the Ukrainians would trample on a number of dwarves from the Baltic States.
You're pinching in the Russian bear fur long enough.
It's worth noticing that even China, too many jumps and it certainly does take to the far East.
And those Germans that Vladimir's pretty as well and I gave them in 45 on the ass.
What about to make one of the new Novorosiju in Karlovy Vary.
It would have been základnička and there is a lot of and how is there even a dacha's oppressed some of them down.
After all, our veterans so far vzpomnají, as in Czechoslovakia had.
Nu vot I their Prime Minister Sobotka is Gospodin so měký, you can peel it like an onion and I eat the whole of their EU.
It would be played on the great Russia leaping.
It is necessary to remind them where their place.
And as we use our fellow-tribesmen, the booster who lives on their territory.
Russians everywhere is enough and when they say that there is oppressed, so is there simply to oppress and we leave, we can't.
And in turn will govern, it Rus what else is born.
Europe is only good as a preposition, the proud Ivan dance kozáčka.

Lenny Henry: my father never, you haven't kissed me.
He never told me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands.
With his father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked at the factory, they had a cooler relationship.

He knew very little about him.
You've never seen his face, you just heard his voice: "stop that noise.
Leave my sister alone.
Get out!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton-when I was a kid, they were already adults-with him went to the bar and talked about things like the shape of the glass with beer or beauty shot in cricket.
I've never talked with him.
Most of my life, it was a serious guy in the corner, what he reads newspapers.
Recently, Henry visited in Dudley foundry, and although conditions were better than in my father's time, he looked into what life had to be for him.
Now there is a little more light, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth, where flames erupting and there is a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad's always climbed into the bathtub and just lay there, then was heard, as you slowly begins to sing for themselves, because of the blurred Foundry.
When I went around, I realized that this years did, in order to support my family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Even though Henry spent his childhood without parental love.
You haven't kissed anyone, my dad said "I love you."
When my mom was sick and dying, we started to say "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter, Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love that his child was missing.
You can stop with the "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we be friends?
It is a great mom
With the French, with whom he was married for 25 years, they are still good friends.
Dawn is good.
Why we should be friends with Dawn?
It's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot of, a lot of big overweight and began to exhibit symptoms of diabetes, the doctor said to me: "you have to make a radical change."
So I started to walk into a large fitness center and I had to hold the drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
Nobody wants to eat the same carrots.
The change in the direction of removing Henry's career is perhaps reflected in his elegant, short-cropped beard.
After he received recognition from the critics for his Othello, delved into the theatre.
Followed by a comedy of errors and fences Augusta Wilson.
It's a different experience than sitcoms and comedy, which filled his hectic working life.
Started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him on the podium, as someone parodies, and wrote about it in the talent portion of the competition, the New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. years: "for a long time I was the only black female impersonator/comedian on tv."
Learning as you go along.
In addition, the public had to notice me, I had to too, between 1975 and 1985, learn how to invent a working jokes, be a star, and performing on television and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Due to the fact that his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, the theme of the program, in which the actors change for blacks, Henry in his comedies eventually performed for five years.
My family was already jumpy because of it.
A little wish it never happened, but Roswell.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on the large stages and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was the "years and years of award-winning British television's main product," but was also "a grotesque parody of the blacks."
In the 1980 's. years, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters, which while they taunted and glorify the British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began broadcasting in 1984, and in the 1990s. He was, inter alia, known as chef Gareth Blacklock in comedy serials Chef!.
Another decade he took ads, documentaries, tv series and films, but after the broadcast of his series LennyHenry.tv on the BBC in 2008, he said: "So what are you gonna do now, Len, it looks a little bit, you hung in one place, or a little bit of you out of the way."
Next up was a documentary on Radio 4 called "What's So Great About...? What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I had a serious allergy.
In school we studied it and I thought this is something for the white middle class.
So I was scared.
Everyone with whom we were doing an interview show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, they said: "you should try it."
Don't push it, if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we're all so fond of Shakespeare.
Henry for the document recited twenty rows from Othellovy final speech and I drove.
It gave me the feeling that I can do it.
As if to give me courage.
"That's what it is. It is a serious thing, take it seriously, learn how to text, something's about to find out.
So testing was hard and before I read that game for months and months.
And it was a success.
It seemed that await a bummer, which did not happen.
He soon began to play in a comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the national theatre. I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought: "you've changed."
A technical problem has occurred and Henry instinctively felt that he must assume responsibility for the seizure of the audience.
"The little voice in my head told me: ' you've got to fix your computer, Than is now ten minutes fun. '"
Instead, the Director announced that the show will continue as soon as the problem.
I retired from the stage and something in me said: "Oh, thank God."
It is not my responsibility.
It can solve for me by someone else.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in the Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learn how to text of fences was a challenge.
Panic is quite good, adds the resolution.
The game was also well received, so it's like a sign from God that says: "you should do This."
Of course, it says in a loud voice.
So, I'm staying.
I really like.
I like the service.
Henry still remains brain-film all the time our conversation interrupted humorous performances, when entering and coming out of the role of the copycat killer.
I decided to do stand-ups, because they have the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I would say.
If you are looking for something you can get into a blind alley.
Sometimes, when I want, I Live at the Apollo, but it's not like before.
I asked if they ever organise a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in the same room with the Director, which helps give the outlines of the beginning and end of the path resource-I don't think I ever wanted to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think Yes.
I enjoy acting.
It is fun.
I still tell stories, which is great.
I love the stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers of State officials to RAID on a non-existent employee
Kenya started with the biometric registration of all of their officials to try and remove them from the payroll of the Government a non-existent employee.
According to the statement of the Government to stop employees who do not register in the next two weeks, receive a paycheck.
The Government believes that thousands of people receive salary even after leaving the service of the State.
After took office in 2013, Uhuru Kenyatta, the President vowed to prevent corruption in public administration.
The audit conducted this year revealed that the State monthly comes at least one million dollars (700,000 pounds) to report the non-existent employees and other misconduct.
The Government suspects that the salaries are still inserted into the bank accounts even after the death of the employee or after an employee leaves the State administration, said the BBC reporter from the capital Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All State officials must come during the next two weeks to the identification centres, where their data will be biometricky recorded the statement of the Government.
Furthermore, he says that anyone who fails, without adequate excuse will be eliminated from the payroll.
"Specifying the actual employees of the public service, these measures will contribute significantly to its rationalisation and also will be used to unclog the payroll at both levels of Government, and resolved the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Department of development and planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested due to a "conspiracy" against the Government
Local media reported that Turkey was detained due to suspicions of "conspiracy against the Government," a total of 33 police officers.
Police Office did not comment on the case so far.
According to the Hurriyet Dail News was among the captured 14 high-ranking officials.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigation of the December, which focused on government officials, including four Ministers.

Not all children in Ukraine returned to the school
Most of the schools in the Ukraine on Monday (September 1) opened again after the summer holiday.
This day is for families traditionally important and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents and the Prime Minister took his daughter Arsenij Jaceňuk to school.
On this occasion, he told reporters here that not all schools opened again, but that is determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on 1 September.
Not on the whole Ukraine, is peace.
We need to fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, joined the Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.

We hope that there will be finally achieved peace and that children acquire the knowledge that will be useful in the future.

In Roně Fairheadové maybe the BBC found a supervisor for tough times
Carries with him the clouds of glory in the world of banking, media management and an internal conservative party conclave.
She has experience from the front lines.
Career began in the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world Pearsons.
Seven years was the Executive Director for the Financial Times. On the function of resigned, when the highest function in the parent company, Pearson's cast her younger colleague.
It is said that her redundancy was million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Camerons were recommended by Lord Browne, former Director of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall wanted a private expertise: became the Adviser to the Office of the Government.
Her husband is a former member of the City Council.
In may, I described the work of the Director as the Cup with poison.
Not only is the BBC'S extensive and complex entity at the center of public life, but in its structure there are also internal paradox.
Corporations are turning in two directions: in the top layer of the hierarchy of his own leadership of the BBC, but also out in the voice of the public in times of unrest when things do not work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly, which calls for a thorough reform.
That the Director would be risked, that comes into the company's complex as Chinese dynasty, decompose it and thereby prepare himself for a job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so difficult, a lot of people would be keen to see how the BBC is shrinking-her power, her finances-and how to revise its status.
With the expanding range of competition and new technology challenges the old security, carries immediate negotiations on the licence fees for the BBC in great danger.
For the modest sum of £ 145,50 per year the British public's buys stake in what is certainly the biggest media company in the world.
BBC tells a good story: claims that its production reaches 96% of households and each stand just 40 pence a day.
In addition, the popularity of the BBC obviously is rising: 53% of supporters, compared to 31% of a decade ago.
Models using the services of the BBC have changed: today I news headlines displayed on your mobile phone and on the shows that I missed, I can take a look at iPlayeru.
But the BBC continues to be a very lovely and amazing bodies.
Needs a wonderful Director-I hope one found.
Texas Gov. Perry claims that the offensive tweet did not approve
A Tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, which was published on Sunday, contained the offensive image of the democratic Prosecutor who initiated criminal charges against Perry's misuse of powers.
The tweet was later deleted and on Perry's account was published next, who distanced himself from the previous.
From my account left tweet, which was not authorized.
"I don't agree with tweetem and I pulled it," he said in the next post.
Perry's aides did not reply to a message with questions immediately.
Although the Tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for its administration.
The previous tweet published an unflattering picture of a ludic, Travis County Prosecutor Rosemary Lehmbergové, which was in April 2013 sentenced for drunken driving.
When he refused to resign, Perry rejected the payment of funds for her Office, which Perry, a potential candidate for President in the election of 2016, this month has brought before the grand jury in Austin.
On the label in the tweet read: "not always driving with three times the blood alcohol level higher than the allowed limit ... but if so, I'd sue the Governor Perry, that it calls for accountability."
I am by no means a Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry led the Office of Lehmbergové.
He had to worry about Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, which was designed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and charges called tactical, political maneuver.
His legal team asked the judge qualified who oversaw the case, dismissed the allegations, because the use of laws to the prosecution the longest serving Governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry said the payment of $ 7.5 million from the State Fund for the Department of Defense of the public interest, which has its registered office in Travis County and prosecutes corruption in Texas, after Lehmbergová has refused to resign.
Refusal sparked a formal complaint of left oriented group of civic activists.
Perry's official account is active-and sometimes even dreamed about.
Once in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, finished in fifth place in the Committee of his party, said Perry on speculation about that he could end up with a custom photo tweetem how to run near the Lake, and with the words: "here I am, South Caroline!"

Exceptional sample of by the acclaimed new novel Howard Jacobsona of love and the letter "J"
They broke up, this is the best way to describe it, gradually unfold like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
From time to time he was just some woman said she is too serious, complex, sharp, isolated and maybe a little irritable.
And then he shook her hand.
It's, ' he said.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, Yes.
The latest victim of his abilities was starting a love affair, which is more than usual, he promised relief from the lonely life of boredom and maybe even provide some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomonsová was a delicate beauty with a wild mane of hair and restless at the heart of the village on the North Island, which was even more remote and more barren than a Port Reuben.
To the South came with an older companion, which is Kevern her aunt, who inherited the property in a humid, but splendid Valley called, aptly, Paradise Valley.
In the House, no one lived for several years.
Pipes in tanks were streaming dead spiders, slugs are oslizle signed on the window, as if they thought that the place belongs, the garden was overgrown with weeds and resembled a huge cabbages.
The House looked like a cottage from children's stories, scary and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the provisional list for the Man Booker Prize nominations by 2014.
Shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern with Ailinn sat on folding chairs in the long grass and holding hands, enjoying unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuned into a public station that the County was comforting music and soothing messages, when in his view of her tanned legs crossed reminded the old song long forgotten black comedian, which is drawn the blinds like he listened to his father.
You have a very large feet.
Due to their natural aggressiveness has already played such songs on radio.
Have not been banned-banned was nothing really-just play.
To help them get into the desuetuda, as well as the word desuetudo.
Popular taste was what would never failed and the status of outside the law, and as well as people's terms, collect memoirs, books in which the poor become rich, cookbooks and love novels, so in the music are collected ballads.
Caverns, let down, and began to play an imaginary piano and coarse, a comical voice sang the great pyramids Aillininým Serenade.
Ailinn did not understand.
"It was a popular song by jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said, and he's automatically two fingers to his lips.
It always did his father, when he wanted to suppress the letter j, before he comes out of his mouth.
It started as a game, when it was still small.
His father told him that he played the game, even with his father.
If you have a Word, what was on j, two fingers before they Kiss, it cost you a penny.
Even then it wasn't very funny and funny, it wasn't even now.
I just knew that this is expected from him, it was all over.
Had to explain what it is jazz.
Ailinn, no never heard of.
Or jazz, even if not directly built outside the law, have not played.
Improvisation out of fashion.
In life it was only room for one "If".
When she began to play the melody, people wanted to know, where exactly will end.
It's the same thing with humor.
His nepředvidatelnost went to people getting on my nerves.
And jazz was a humor expressed in songs.
Although up to ten years, heard about Sammy Davis Junior, he knew his father's jazz from Kevern polotajné collections of old CD.
At least but not Aillin say that Fats Waller was black.
Due to his age, could not remember a time when popular singers were blacks.
Too without laws or coercion.
Easy company is one in which each part with gratitude – with gratitude those were good save-agrees with the principle group of gratitude.
People of afro-Caribbean origin, temperament and stature threw for antics and athletics, and so they sang and were running.
People originating from the Indian subcontinent, as if nature gifted for electronics, take responsibility for it, that no family will be without a functional phone.
Poles, what remained were the plumbers, the Greeks left, they washed the dishes.
Those from the States of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents quickly abandoned the country while IT was happening, what happened, IF IT HAPPENED-they were afraid that they would be accused that they put into the fire, actually feared that the fire next time is spent-opened restaurant sold labneh and smoked Hookah, neupozorňovali, and inaction is slowly consumed with.
Each according to his talent.
Whereas, listening just ballads, Ailinn hard to understand how expletives from the words that she just sang, caverns, could rise to music.
The music was an expression of love.
"In fact, they are not bad," said Kevern.
Maybe it was just for people who have very big feet.
My father never offended anyone, but this song was like.
He talked too much, but neglected the garden gave the illusion of security.
From behind the sound-proofed sheets could not escape even a Word.
Ailinn I still didn't understand.
Why would your father did something like that?
Wanted to say that it was a joke, but was reluctant to put in her presence again's two fingers to his mouth.
I thought, that's weird.
"She seemed to him humorous," he said.
She shook her head in disbelief and overshadowed the Kevernovi views.
In the whole wide world there was nothing more than a jumble of its safe hair.
Didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said, dubiously.
But that still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She was really upset.
I have big feet?
He looked again.
The foot so totally not.
Maybe a little ankles...
You say that you hate me, because I have a very thick ankles?
I hate?
This is not true.
It's just a silly song.
He could tell her "I love you", but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles just attract," he tried.
I'm a bit sick.
It went wrong.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic to be able to tame the cruelty, which lay in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe he was intentionally cruel Caverns.
Despite the kindly eyes.
Ailinn Solomonsová flushed and lifted her from the couch, pulled the radio and a handful of spilled wine.
Elder wine, so it could drink.
She seemed to be shaking in their excitement as the palm leaves in the storm.
"Me perversely attracted to that, you're a jerk," said ...
Except that it does not attract me.
He was sorry for her, as for their unkind words, so because of the fear that was in his eyes at a moment when built against him.
She thought it?
Talk with him about life on the cold northern peninsula, where she grew up, but doubted that the foundations there were the same as here.
The course is the same and the wide ocean.
The same disturbance men, then, what happened, even more nedůtklivější and more morose than their ancestors, smugglers and kazisvěti, angry loafing from pub to pub, ready to lay a hand on any woman who would refuse or person dared to flout them.
Jerk?
If it's not careful, it will show your fists!
Her first hug-hug has become the most common term for erotic stimulation between husband and wife: antibody flat love ballads that radio chrlilo-caress her first, then her one stick.
According to the Kevernova opinion, too much sophistication, because Petting was in itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomonsová to him nonverbally to left.
He rose from the Chair as an old man.
She felt the weight of his cross, but surprised her sadness.
It was not the end of the world.
Almost strangers.
She watched as he leaves-as if watching him from a window in the floor-man, which was what he did.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart felt for him and for all men in General, regardless of that, there are a few zbilo her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders hunched, ashamed, the loser, all militancy left him-why it seemed to her that he knows well, even when she's equipped with a single moment until today, that it would ever see?
Ailinn Solomonsová, alone again, looked at his feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme, smart and enthusiastic teaching of STOA dvaatřicetiletá, including working in Ofnow, nestatutárním monitoring system of public mood, has a short article on the persistence of light and medium-heavy acts of violence in areas of the country, where the mitigation or stopping, the most expected, if its removal has been spent enough money and energy.
"A lot has been done and a lot of it has to do," she wrote, "to calm down the innate aggression of the people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in hard to reach places, come the country where, despite the Church spires rising above the tips of the hedges cast of human kindness has historically occurred only rarely."
Some things, however, are irreplaceable.
It would seem that the higher the Tower, the lower are the instincts.
The inhabitants of vzdychají over sentimentálními baladami, soaking in the unfortunate stories and declare that firmly believes in the value of marriage and family life, but not only in rural areas old brutality holds as well stubbornly as in urban areas, but the evidence also shows that, at home, in the workplace, the roads and even on sports courses appears new and assault intolerance.
"Unfortunately, you have a tendency to too květnatému style," said her manager.
I would suggest you to read less novels.
Esme teaching of STOA bowed her head.
Also, I have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I have the impression that I don't have to answer," said Esme teaching of STOA.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme said again your right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
More silence.
"I'm not asking because" he said Rabinowitz, "that I had something against lesbians, ateistům, or feministkám.
On this site we have no prejudices.
We serve the unfettered society.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which itself is absolutely acceptable and laudable, can sometimes distort judgment, as you have demonstrated you.
Obviously you're prejudiced against the Church-things that you call "cruel" and "brutal", others might interpret it also as a representation of the natural forces and energy.
I still deal with what happened, IF IT HAPPENED, as if it happened, if it happened, yesterday, preparing the ground with her basic life force.
While Rabinowitz, Esme spoke the teaching of STOA looked around.
For his head on a light Board pink from the recommendation to the world aired the last Ofnow quarter-century or more.
Smile on a neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your telephone, chat, explain, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, Sung Word is better than written, but there's nothing better than love.
"Absolutely I understand your reservations," said Esme quietly teaching of STOA, when she was sure that her boss had ended, "and I'm not saying that the morning nezhojila so, how're we kidding that's zhojila.
My concern is that if it advised in advance, we reiterate the same mistake that led to what HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED.
But this time the anger and mistrust we vent on the other.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the tips of the fingers.
It should indicate the infinite patience.
"It's gone too far," he said, "If the steps that maybe they did and maybe do your grandparents, you describe as errors.
Too far gone even in the fact that you're talking about that ventilovali's your "anger" and "mistrust" of the "other."
I had someone on your site to remind that in the understanding of the past and protect the presence of not talking about "us" and "them."
There was no "we" and "they weren't."
We know only that it was a chaotic time.
"During which, if we are honest," Esme took courage, "no we are not blameless.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened, happened.
It was before.
This is not what the add-in that we agree.
And just as there is no fault, which could seduce someone, nor are there things that should be corrected, even if the remedy was appropriate and possible.
But what else is in the past, than to learn from it-
The past exists, we have forgotten.
If I can add something-
Luther Rabinowitz rozpojil fingertips.
"I'll take into account your message," he said, and dismissed her.
Day, when she went to work as usual, it was hit by a motorcyclist, who ran on the sidewalk in a way that people describe as "brutal and fierce."
Coincidences happen.

He added: in the euro area Producers currently have a life very complicated, because the increasing geopolitical tensions, especially between Russia and Ukraine-are still demanding conditions added to in many countries even more uncertainty.
This increasing uncertainty trade a proven hit-and that, above all, the trust of consumers, which may cause some orders will be postponed or even canceled, mainly those costly.
Said that, as "even more likely" seems to be that the ECB eventually will have to perform some form of quantitative easing, "Although we expect that it will be limited."
Ten years of hell survivors of Beslan: ten years after the horrors of the occupied school children still suffer
A decade ago, it was the Chechen radicals in a school in Beslan in southern Russia as a hostage seized thousands of people
During the ordeal, which lasted for three days and that shocked the world, killed more than 330 people, more than half of which were children
We went back to Beslan, in order to identify some of the victims during the atrocities in school escaped death
Exactly ten years after the eerie cast the school in Beslan in which 334 people were killed, including 186 children, warned last night, the surviving heroes before a new Apocalypse in Ukraine.
When the 1. September 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, were captured and murdered by fanatical terrorists, children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance above the tragedies joined East and West, which in this disastrous calamity led to negotiations and the future.
After ten years we are in Beslan in southern Russia returned, in order to identify some of the victims during the atrocities in school escaped death.
We found the amazing young people who braved the disaster, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists in them will live on.
What is their biggest wish?
That war, which is now destroying Ukraine-and in which children as they die-is over.
The girl who is attempting to get back into the destroyed school gym
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dmitri Beliakovem, as only in his underwear, trying to get back to the rozbombardované school gym after a bomb exploded in her.
Confused, looking for his mother desperately Aida Larisa, who is now 40.
There were fears that the two are dead, but in fact survived.
"A woman said to me, whether I'm running and I will save your life, but I couldn't," she said at Aida.
I had blood all over his legs.
I got up and went back to find my mother.
It saved the soldier.
After several operations, she thought that he had fully recovered, but yesterday she said: "three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid that I'll have for the next operation.
In his knee left pieces of shrapnel.
Its goal is to become a dentist to help people as doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but definitely not destroyed him," she said firmly.
"It Just happened and I can't change it.
Once a year I go to the gym, I remind those who stayed there.
Otherwise, about trying to talk with his friends.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future fellow classmate from the class Džeru Gapoevu there was killed.
As a small, we played and we've represented, how we're going to go to school.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and I do not start a career.
I'm thinking about the family at a later date.
He says that captivity haven't forgotten, but the memories fade a little bit every year.
I'm glad that so many people around the world still remembers what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we got from the uk and from other countries.
When on the Internet looking at your picture, I'm coming back as a school through the window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, to understand the disaster and prevent repeated.
The boy, who escaped the rain of bullets and he believed that his mother is dead
It was his first day of school (children's school in Russia, starting in seven years) and survived the three-day siege of a school in the embrace of her mother Tamara.
At that time the seven-year said, "my Mom told me that if there was an explosion, I have to lie down on the ground and hold her hand."
After the explosion, he thought that his mother is dying.
She told him: "run."
He was afraid that she is dead, he ran and saw a crying toddler, grabbed the child by the hand, and ran a spray of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who caught him out, said: "Damir told me that his mother is dead."
He says: "I could not save her."
In fact, Tamara stumbled into the freedom and lay in the hospital with the injured leg and thought that her son died.
After again, she said: "I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran inside and put his arm around me.
Damir then flew to London (as in recent newspaper News of the World), where he was the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie was declared the winner of the Bernardo's Children.
"The horror every day returns, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
I can say that the memories no longer fade.
I remember that right after I threw away all my gun to play with.
But today I can play computer games, in which he shoots, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think to myself.
I remember the children, with whom I played in the backyard, and out come.
We say that it is never killed or died.
We stayed in the gym.
On a trip to London, I remember well, mainly on this, as I'm in a toy store could choose whatever I wanted to, and as I rode in a convertible.
But now worried about places like Ukraine, where because of the war suffer as much as he and his friends suffered.
The horror every day returns, but I wish I could stop thinking about
"I really feel sorry for anyone who has to go through that kind of horror," says Damir, who last week took part in volunteer activities in the monastery.
I want very much to help.
One day I want to work with the police and I hope that next year will take me to the Academy.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: "they killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack. There were no children there were screaming and running, and it still took several months.
Vividly remembers the path with the Damirem in London.
When I told our story in London, people wept.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blairové and its foundation granted the price and for the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call you and personally tell Cherie, that even though it's been ten years, I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London and how me and Damirovi help.
I remember he had a taste for Borscht, Damir and so they called all the Russian restaurant.
I remember, too, how he played in the restaurant with waiters, Damir on them shot from a water gun and they ran and played with him.
And it was just a month away from the horror.
I was surprised how the British like to share with us about our pain, and how to support us.
She said: "I still think that the world has changed in the ten years to get better.
Now it's the war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think that it was and still will be killed and a lot of children.
They are the same as those of our children.
I think for a lot of people, the war is just something in the news that you hear when they are bored, or while doing something else.
I know what those people are, what is this terror.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and it is a nice and quiet guy, not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, the desire for revenge, he couldn't care less.
I know that I don't recalls, but has a lot of close to six classmates and from time to time he goes to the gym and Kindle candles there.
When he was small, he had problems with it-I remember how you ever lay down on the couch with his face away from us and sometimes so lay for hours.
Slept, had my eyes open.
I remember, too, that fired all his guns or other weapons to play with. Damirovi today is 17, is taller than me, nice, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I have a few hours was sure he was dead and that I'll never see you again.
When I recovered after the explosion and picked up at your feet, I looked around and saw hell, everywhere there were pieces of human bodies.
I was sure that my baby didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
"I remember how I cried ' Damire, run, run! ', but I was convinced that he could hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life is unlike the other away.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose taken the photo after the attack became a symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Consolation: the survivors of Beslan Grigory Ilyin to his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, on the right, Grigory today
When he ran for the life after the Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, he was into his bloody face vrytý fear.
His photo was one of the most shocking atrocities in Beslan symbols.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a physician, he landed his first day at the school and was in a hurry to take his older son Vladimir to the University.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the yard, so my little boy there three days alone," she recalled.
Not alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died.
I just survived my Grigory.
As that date approaches, it is still difficult to think and talk about it.
One day before the tragedy, we couldn't.
Does not seem to us that it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back.
I promise that no one will ever forget.
Still, returning memories: photo of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember how I was looking forward to that day, Grigory to school, he said, he wants to hug his teacher.
That is alive, I learned, when I saw him on tv.
In San Marino there is even a statue of a crying Grigory.
Grigory on that picture looks like and at home we have her hidden in a bookcase.
I understand that, but I think that, thanks to the image people around the world know what kind of pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: "it is important that this doesn't happen again.
"I doubt if we'll ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still investigating, but no one will never know the truth.
Now investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.
We sometimes, what was the cause?
The world is waiting for something very bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because when people ask, so a war no one wants, so how is it possible?
Ten years is not such a pain for nothing.
To at least a little bit forgotten, needs for decades.
It had the effect on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years, I had nightmares about the attack, but then it improved.
When I then in 2004 he returned to school, I was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates that they killed.
Therefore, when approaching 1. September, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of friends from childhood.
It is hard for me to join a gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I'll never forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and began to study medicine at the University in the rest of the day.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
At first I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of health.
I wanted to fight for their country, but it won't work.
Farniyev, Grogorij 20
The boy, who survived, although it is holding at his feet was the terrorists
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was detained during the attack at his feet was the terrorists, however, managed to survive the
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught up in the gym, as sitting next to a bomb at his feet was the terrorists.
It's a miracle that he survived.
"It seems to us as if it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal security services, but because of the injury, which he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I threw it behind the head.
Now I'm older and it is said that children with bad experiences can deal better now-I have to say that this is not true.
"In 2006, I went to a psychologist and then a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005-a year later-this was the first and the last time I went to the gym again.
I blacked out.
Never again, I won't go there anymore, and you don't want me to show you where the familiar figure sitting.
Survivors: Gregorij Farniev today, on a laptop with his photographs taken at the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I hate to think about it or I'm talking and never ask me for a school.
In terms of physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful on my knee that I hurt, but I normally.
But even so, i couldn't compete because of health and studying at the Academy in St. Petersburg, FBS as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they answered me that it is not possible.
My other hobby is animals, so I joined in, '' he said.
I just finished the second year.
Learn how to treat all the animals from the cats after a cow. "
He said: "I know that my children never tell about it will be.
It's not something children should know and not something that should get to experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "the pain will be here all the time.
Is inside and it's getting worse with the approaching anniversary.
The comments I will attend ceremonies.
I know that Grigory won't work.
It must be for him to even stronger because there apart from me.
I'm waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that I returned it. Here in Beslan footprints are everywhere.
It remains with us.
Gregorij today is an adult, but the horror she carries on.
It is hard to take, when will something so terribly unfair.
It's a boy, likes sport, but cannot make it because of my knee.
He underwent several operations, can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say that 50% of the terror overcame, but to overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will be with us all the time.
During the attack killed a lot of our friends and neighbors, and the pain just gets worse.
I lost a lot of people that I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could give me, but the loss hurts killed.
I know a family in which more children were born, but also widows, which he again nevdaly.
It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if you don't.
I'll never forget how my heart nearly jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I've been watching what's going on in the world-war in other places.
What those people fighting?
Why they kill each other?
The war is now coming to our country, and I can hardly believe it.
In the past we were one affiliated country, how did we get to the fact that we are fighting together now?
People and children suffering from, I'm sure that many children in the Ukraine was and still will be killed.
If only we could all those rebels pick up and discard is-as far as it will go.

4 tips on how to take better underwater photos and videos
If you are interested in photographing or filming under water, you have available a large selection of equipment.
The cheapest options for kompakt for example Nikon Coolpix camera type outdoor AW120 or GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, which costs around $ 300.
These photos I took on the family celebration a few disposable cameras, all cost less than $ 350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you are using, but for best results, apply a few rules.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set the camera, depending on what type of photos or videos you take.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scenic or shooting mode, which optimizes the exposure for dark environment under the water.
And before you start, find out how deep you can dive with his equipment.
Some cameras are intended only to 5 stop, next to the 50 to 60.
Read our buying guide and evaluation of digital cameras in the current, and waterproof design.
Always do a few images-a lot of them doesn't work out.
Compact cameras have an LCD that will help you with the way pictures, but outdoor got any.
Even if you have a LCD, under water would be wrong to see and the composition of the shot will be nepředvidatelná.
So always do more frames.
If the camera bracketingový mode, which makes a series of images with slightly different exposure variance, take advantage of it.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper draught light significantly decreases.
If possible, keep the photo shoot in the pool, Lake or the Sea close to the surface.
It also allows you to capture more light on the photos-the deeper the dive, the fewer colors you see.
Get close to the fotografovanému object.
This is excellent advice, if you snap on the land, but under the water is even more important because of the tlumenějšímu light.
This is especially important if you're shooting with outdoor camera: such devices usually have hard and wide angle lenses, which means that if you want to fill the frame, you must zoom in to objects more.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality could change things, even in such a huge organization like the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, a career dedicated to the sick, ' cried from the pain caused by the disease and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who seek his help, he was officer in charge of MI6, who had to live with the consequences of torture, which crippled him.
Lawson realized that while physicians concentrate on the diagnosis and treatment of illness, patients overwhelmingly interested in something else: the pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel comfortable in your skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt I was without power.
Faced with flu symptoms and found that is impatient and his wife Juliet includes remorse.
Noted: "I want to make everything happened rather sooner than later."
When Juliet went for a week on a business trip, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague did a chest x-ray.
One two weeks before skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came in.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura or lining of the lungs.
For most types of cancer is difficult to determine what was the cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer, smoking.
Mesothelioma is but another.
In almost all cases is the cause of exposure to asbestos-vláknitému building material that was previously referred to as "the miracle", but today knows that it is deadly.
For most of us it's hard to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos used in Britain since the 1960s. years ago, when entered into force to ban the use of asbestos in the industry.
Even at a time when asbestos was used, in close contact with him came only a certain group of people, for example, pokladači insulation, builders, carpenters and laborers in shipyards.
A toxin used in the industry in a different era today hardly seems like a reason for concern.
Such complacency is not in place.
As it turns out, in the uk today, culminating in mezoteliomová of the epidemic.
The number of deaths from Mesothelioma there is higher than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths from this disease every year is more than twice the number of victims of automobile accidents.
The number of deaths from Mesothelioma annually since 1980 and estimated deaths in the uk in the future
The reason why only now we feel its effects, although the use of asbestos for years illegal (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes a few decades before mesothelioma develop.
Disaster in the form of mesothelioma is not not just veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases still is, present in homes in which we live, in the offices, where we are working in schools, where we learn and in shops, in which we buy.
Mesothelioma is not a social layer, wealth, profession or age.
Privileged bastions from the London home business after public schools do not cover.
And Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even the hospital, in which the us should treat this store are mortal "carcinogen".
Andrew Lawson was old.
Or not the insulation.
Trying to find out where it could come into contact with asbestos.
Then it came.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement hallways of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All-students, nurses, physicians and gatekeepers-corridor use.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries gets the same disease?
Unfortunately it was the question that was partially answered.
"Of the four doctors who were on practice in Guy's Hospital and then in the past five years has mesothelioma," said in a letter in 2010, "I'm the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mezoteliomem, when he was 48.
When 17. February of this year he died, he was 55.
With this diagnosis survive for so long is not normal.
55 percent of the people diagnosed with mezoteliomem die within eight months from diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
Now, therefore, we can only repeat the Lawsonovu question: "how many of us get sick of the same disease?"
According to a leading British expert on mesothelioma Professor Juliana Pete best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the uk takes place, about 90 000 people will die.
Most of them currently has no idea that dies this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
When a cursory inspection of the documents from the archives of the courts to which disabilities often turn and require compensation, shows how much the mezoteliomická disaster spread.
For example, this June, the company admitted Marks Spencer from & negligence exposed asbestos Janice Allen.
She worked for a string of nine years, from 1978 to roku1987, where it supervised in two stores in the section clothing-one of the places was the flagship of the company store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for the M&S.
Today he has two children, which is over twenty.
"Before it happened," he says, "I never heard of mesothelioma, I hardly knew anything about the asbestos.
I never dreamed that I could relate to.
Not a lot of people who know something about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name was given due to its fibrous structure, which gives him the strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals were used in the construction of three.
Most commonly it is today in the buildings can be found chryzotil, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in the roof panel, floor tiles, bojlerových seals and even brake linings.
Not so deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and the WHO still considered him a "big risk to health", which can cause death.
More dangerous but it is the brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of the brown asbestos, and experts say that "there is compelling, but circumstantial evidence, that it was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the uk]."
Agent Spencer was the Marsk & asbestos exposed in the flagship store in Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen might be considered a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Peta points out that her story is not unusual.
His studies of patients argues that "a substantial part of the cases of mesothelioma without a known exposure to asbestos at work or at home may have been caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
A considerable part of this exposure is caused by normal use and weathering "of the buildings.
It seems that one cannot be sure that it is safe.
The report, which examined the Goddard Consulting houses, showing that even people in the middle of the Government does not suspect that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, according to a report published by Goddard which are staff elevators and piping for the parliamentary committee rooms contaminated by asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be violated something as harmless as "a strong current of air."
Ministers are often accused of that care only about their own interests, in this case, but it may be the opposite of the truth.
Although the Directorate of services, Parliament insisted that the houses got the "positive medical certificate", is now with the fact that you will need one million pounds and several years of work, Parliament was thoroughly examined, to modernise the electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the election in 2015 will be members rather than on the Green benches in Westminster to sit in the premises of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre.
In the report Goddardu that "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with the provisions of the few."
It is not possible to say whether this inconsistency will cost lives.
Everyone can now only wait.
One of the persons who have never been able to determine when the exposure to asbestos occurred, is Graham Abbott, physician.
As well as Andrew Lawson has Abbott (50) suspected that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in the hospital, where it was demonstrated by the presence of asbestos," he says, "but in my case I can't prove.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked, and when he worked there.
But he remembers clearly the day in early December 2009 when they won against something like a fever.
He was 45, he was just in the middle of the night and the operation.
Suddenly I began to tremble.
It came at the same time.
I was awful.
I thought nedojedu drive home.
Because he was a doctor, knew that the pain stems from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
But as Janice Allen had no reason to believe that this is about Mesothelioma.
Finally, he spent a month at home.
Confused doctors did a chest x-ray and introduced him to the thoracic catheter, to remove fluid from his lungs, which they sent to the analysis.
Yet did not the diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
From time to time but the symptoms returned, often after zacvičil and jumped in.
In 2011, came into the operating room, one of the Abbottových of patients with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott's nothing to tie their own case.
In the end, his patient was a few dozen years older and working to get in direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbottův relapse and his doctor zkonzultoval his slides from the CT and x-ray with the Panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, he was into the space between the lining of the chest cavity and lining of the lung introduced the probe equipped with a camera.
I'm an optimist.
I have a tendency not to take anything too much, "he says.
To be honest, I worry.
But Rachel, my wife, she's worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and the new year: "they told me that it is a Mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mezoteliomem
Abbott began to meet with the Sisters of charity Macmillan and advise him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipeline," he says.
For people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now begins to manifest the disease.
Mesothelioma is now beginning to relate to younger people who do not have the risk profession.
The most dangerous pipes insulated with asbestos in hospitals were in the basement, so it was unlikely that it would pose a threat to patients.
However, staff members who moved between corridors suterénními buildings (such as Andrew Lawson), or eat in the basement dining rooms (as often Graham Abbott) certainly in contact with the toxic substance came from.
As it now appears, was for several decades after the war, the Hospital where patients could save your life, but also a place that could endanger the life of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos removal today.
Bunsen's burner pupils built on asbestos pads
And it's not just about the hospital.
Asbestos is often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulating and fire-resistant properties.
Also in schools.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos in the school.
Somewhere in countless hours of chemistry students built a Bunsen burner on asbestos mat.
Generated Web pages dealing with the question of asbestos in schools.
Harmless stuff like floor tiles or roof shelters on the tool in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison, built into a large number of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against the Guy's Hospital.
In one case, was the only contact with asbestos, on which a woman suffering from mezoteliomem could remember in the 70 's. years when demolishing the Garden Cottage.
So be careful, as boříte Garden House.
With the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is the impact the diagnosis of huge.
"It takes time before it occurs," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I've found that I can't concentrate on what I'm doing.
I was in the operating room two weeks ago.
Then I realized that I have to go away and deal with yourself.
Well, another Christmas day.
One of the hardest things was the transition from the position of physician to the position of the patient.
As a myriad of patients before him, and he remembers how he felt confused from the amount of information that had to be addressed.
"It was hard to understand all of this," he says.
"I asked your doctor:" how much time do I have left? "
I was told that the twelve months.
I remember how I thought: "well, other Christmas day.
So it is. "
Mesothelioma is a particularly destructive, because the mechanism is what keeps us alive-the breathing-is what causes cancer, that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma is caused by asbestos exposure.
Asbestos forms tiny fibres.
When asbestos fibers and breathe, can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers can cause irritating the pleura and the mutation of cells.
"The problem are the vdechnutá asbestos fibers in the shape of rods," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic surgeon, who in 2001 got into the Guy's Hospital.
In the same hospital, where he was exposed to asbestos, Andrew Lawson, apparently, and that is, paradoxically, the head of the Centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos, probably during practice at the hospital.
Needles of asbestos are lung tissue, says Treasure, and "breathing is pushing itself to the edge of where the pad is located.
By its very nature is invasive from the very beginning.
Mesothelioma treatment options for common used for other types of cancer, as many do not.
It is discussed, for example, about the effectiveness of the operation.
According to some, was behind the attempt.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You reach around her scalpel.
The cancer does not respond to chemotherapy, "too", which "has some effect," but left untreated.
"Sometimes there is someone who has lung cancer will survive," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients living much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis Graham Abbott still struggling.
After finding a mesothelioma, Abbott made contact with Andrew Lawsonem who, four years after his diagnosis, individual support and became a consultant for disabled people as well.
When called, cheerfully introduced himself: "Hello, you've reached the headquarters of cancer."
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
The disease he was diagnosed four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning they offered six cycles of chemotherapy to Abbott, which lasted four months, and would probably have his life prolonged, just about a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson but "did things I show in the light."
After having visited several doctors, with Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduskim from the Department of thoracic surgery at the hospital, Guy's Hospital.
"I had an advantage, that I didn't have to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called and they checked me," admits Graham.
The normal patient would have to get a claim and he would have to approve the payment.
In order to be able to get to the best available treatment for patients with mezoteliomem is the question of money is key.
But when the different treatment then inevitably fail, many patients are facing other financial concerns-about the future of the family, which would leave here.
And, therefore, are turning to the courts and to compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898 known that asbestos is harmful," says Morgan.
In the 1960 's. years, but found that even his very small amount can constitute a health risk.
And here we encounter with the negligence of the company.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital, eventually reconciled, but according to Morgan it was not "full compensation", since he could not definitively prove Lawson that mesothelioma was as a result of exposure to asbestos in Guy's Hospital.
After investigating the case, but a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that asbestos in the basement of the alleged "part was removed in the 1990s. years. "
Andrew Lawson, it was too late.
How to remove asbestos
Blame exposure to asbestos death to one company or place of work-usually tens of years after it happened-for patients with mezoteliomem seeking compensation turned out to be a huge problem.
A lot of former workplaces has changed owners or go bankrupt.
Registration fuse box is missing.
And those who are now fighting the accusations they have time on their side, which of their applicants, definitely not.
In response to this, the fact was this year approved important new legislation that makes it easier for the patients with mezoteliomem to claim compensation, even if their former employer cannot be traced.
The law created a 350 million-dollar financial reserve, which shall be borne by the undertaking and which is designed for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos, but they don't have someone to sue.
In this case the disability will receive 80% of the amount that you would in a normal case, the Court gives as a settlement-approximately 120 000 pounds.
Each year is expected to be 300 successfully handled requests.
Andrew Morgan as well as patients with mezoteliomem think that £ 350 million is a "good job".
"It's an agreement drawn up by the insurance companies for insurance companies," he says and points out that the sum is a quarter of what the insurance companies would have to pay if they intervened time and people with mezoteliomem would have been able to pursue the former employer and the normal way is to sue.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law had gaps. "
But Penning and Morgan concede that due to the seven deaths each year had to be swift action.
"The people are suffering and need too much right now," said Penning in December last year, during the second reading of the law concerning mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunskiho 19 months.
After initial consultations recommended Lang-Lazdunski operation, which, unlike Tom's Treasura thought, that has a positive effect.
After the surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy-triple therapy, which Lang-Lazdunski can boast five years survival rate of up to 40% of patients.
Abbott has strengthened it.
"It's obviously not the most important thing," says Abbott.
Patients you see it all the time.
Is there anything you.
When you give up your condition may deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
In late August he finished last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
Visits were no symptoms of the disease.
On the next check I went in March [2014].
In the chest I had scattered a few spots [cancer].
Just coming to my 50th birthday.
It does not affect your life.
Takes him.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Currently, there are no traces in the body of the tumor.
But it is physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You need to think about the practical things-to financial collateral, to die, or to show my wife how it works the alarm clock on the boiler.
When you learn the bad news, you begin to be negative.
You have to look ahead.
As for Ellie's father (16) and Tamsin (14) it is not always easy.
"For parents it's hard," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and what to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my status means that I will never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is a very sociable and wild.
She said friends and suddenly we started to call a lot of people.
Ellie was more restrained.
Didn't you tell too much.
Such talks must face all patients with cancer.
In patients with mezoteliomem but not odlehčeny hope such talks or just the hint of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought and Stephen Jay Gould) unpleasant certainty.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose the leadership-the protesters promise revenge
The Chinese Parliament despite the proliferating discussing democratic reform on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for election in 2017.
It is likely that this step invokes the long-promised protests in the commercial district of Hong Kong, as the activists began to organize and prepare just a few hours after this notification.
The Chinese people's Congress authorizes the Communist leaders basically disqualify any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"Though surprised, but infuriated us," said zákonodárkyně, Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
It's not what Beijing has promised.
People in Hong Kong, they lied.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, said Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the national people's Congress Li Fei, that allow public nomination in the election of the leadership of Hong Kong would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong to China, the Administration promises to Beijing, that starting in 2017, residents will be able to elect the Executive.
Chinese leaders present Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, since Hong Kong allows the direct vote, the decision but also clearly demonstrates that Chinese leaders hold firmly in the hands of the process of nominations Committee, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to a new clause will be přípustní only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong."
The decision came after a summer that saw some of the biggest and most closely watched the protests in Hong Kong for several years.
For the majority of pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong is the movement of occupation Headquarters with love and peace, whose organizers have threatened the closure of the financial district, if Beijing does not grant a general right to vote.
On Sunday night, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the movement have gathered in the rain in front of the occupation of the seat of Government of Hong Kong.
The organizers of the demonstration told that their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience, and that in the coming weeks will launch a wave of protests.
However, it did not provide any other details, apparently wanted to avoid trouble with the authorities.
In its Internet statement, the organizers said that the movement "considered the occupation Headquarters just as the last step in the case that all options have been exhausted and there will be no dialogue, no other choice.
We regret to announce that today all the possibilities have been exhausted, and cast the Central dialogue is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong to alert Beijing prepared for days and on Sunday to strengthen the protection of the Government, and increase the number of police officers and barricades.
Inciting a riot, according to many residents of Hong Kong, a sign that slowly losing control of the city.
A flurry of people from the Mainland increases competition in the area of products and services.
Also growing concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are the increasing pressure from Beijing bent.
Some people criticize the movement of occupation Headquarters and say that their demonstrations threaten trade-rescue boat to Hong Kong.
"Protest, which speaks, could cause much greater economic damage, depending on how many people will be attending and for how long," says politician Regina Ip, which has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to spread fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could damage investment.
Chinese State media also came in recent days with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong are rendered as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists have organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights to which came the 780 000 participants – more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.

League in Jihlava wears the name according to the political movement
A little football plays in the regional capital of the Highlands of approximately 1 600 amateur athletes.
And their top competition is the newly appointed jointly by the League for Jihlava.
The name was given by a single movement, which goes to the October municipal elections.
Ten on his ballot is also Chief of the small football in Jihlava Jan Mráka.
"It was the General Assembly, where no problem is not," said Mráka.
The situation around the first League football had dealt with small lawyers Jihlava Town Hall and recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
Mini-football won last year, according to the Web site of the city of around a million crowns.
This year, the amount in the hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not a small football in violation of the law or regulations of the municipality.
But the situation is for the authority to modify the rules of the allocation of grants and subsidies, "said a spokesman for the municipality of Radek Tulis.
Draw the subsidy from the city, and at the same time expressed as a small football support in the election of one political party, it probably won't work.
On vysočinský, the "great" football similar to the request from politicians yet to come.
That would be incurred by the CSSD, ODS regional championship Division, or KDU-CSL 1.
And class, and similar to the competition?
I would not have to.
On the contrary, I was like, if we turned our sponsors from among the companies, "said the President of the regional Football Association Miroslav Vrzáček.
The boss of a small football, other parties and movements in the name of the League won't let go
According to the players a little football this sport in Jihlava deserved its own area with six pitches, changing rooms and sanitary facilities.
"For example, Stoupách is not our pitch, we rent out there," said Ondřej Lapeš from Club Starlet Jihlava.
The best location would be Czech mill.
But there will be build, for example, in my opinion, pointless area for skejťáky, which is situated in Jihlava city about fifty, "said Mráka.
The Mayor of the city of Jihlava Jaroslav Erased (ODS) responded that small football uses the pitch in the streets and on the Stoupách, Rošického which are in the possession of the city.
We want to build a playground, which have a maximum usage.
We're about modernisation or construction of sports facilities at schools, which will be available in the afternoon.
I think that for a small football in recent years made a huge progress, "he added, Erased.
Other political parties in the names of leagues, according to Jana Mráky not appear.
We have restrictions.
If you are into a partnership someone from one field to enter, so the second we already there, "he explained.
"Political movement in the name of the League, that I consider the minimum for an unfortunate step," said the City Hall Commission for sports Charles Voldán.
"But voters assess whether Mr. Mráka uses the Association of mini-football in Jihlava and subsidies the city for political purposes, or not," he added.
An American tradition penetrates into university life-freshmen can fly jet aircraft
We are pleased that we can respond to the demands of running the first luxury travel services for students in the uk.
For the purpose of leaving the best possible impression on arrival at the University, the company also offers shipping options, including private jets or cars of type Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also said that service has its Security page.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to tote your stuff through the whole State in the dangerously loaded the car.
We hope that with our VIF (very important fresher-very important freshman) variants this year students at the University that will arrive with the minimum of nervousness and maximum luxury.
A company spokesman said that due to the fact that the service started, do not have yet any reservations, but added: "the students begin to do bookings over the next few weeks."
The company also said that although the students pay annual tuition fees in the amount of 9 000 pounds, it is expected that the service on the market finds its place.
In comparison with the students before ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years ago are today's students and others, in terms of expectations and wishes-is more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the appropriate way to do so.
The National Union of students but criticized as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for higher education, said: "for most students is such a project impossible.
A lot of students who are embarking this month on the University, must, before blowing up thousands of pounds for something as simple as arrive at College, to cope with the financial crisis, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants is unable to keep up with the rising costs of basic needs.
Feminists after the events in Fergusonu opposed to racism and the behavior of the police
At the beginning of the month killed a policeman in Fergusonu in Missouri an unarmed young man.
Present pending the funeral with their hands up chants of: "hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Fergusonu in Missouri due to the shooting of an unarmed young man, Michael Brown, has seen bloggerka Miriam Zoila Perézová shift in Internet discussions of white feminists.
Found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and equality of income, tend to prefer white feminists before the race.
With increasing voltage on the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, noticed that the Perézová 's reaction to Southern white women in 100% concentrated on the race.
In comparison to the reactions of the black soon after shooting 9. August personal articles with titles like "thought white women over Ferguson" or "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
According to Perézové, it represents an important change.
"I think in the feminist movement is not a lot of people who would be talking about race and privileges at such a level," she said.
People felt that what happened, must be express.
For the crisis that we are facing, it is a characteristic, because [the situation in Fergusonu] is so racially distinct that it had to be noted.
According to Professor of English at the State University in Ohio Korithy Mitchellové brought Ferguson to light the problems that African-American women must face every day and that in the cultural sphere are not perceived as "women's issues".
"I'm on Facebook post funny stories of life with your partner and it gets 150 liků from people from around the world," said Mitchell.
When I write something about the fact that people of color are in their own country in the trap, it's the silence deafening.
"How is it possible that a woman can publicly talk about relationships, but not on safety in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, which dealt with the question of race, gender and sexuality in American history, exists between the issues of race and gender dichotomy.
It's black women could not enjoy the luxury of these problems clearly split: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Although white women today, the question of race and gender in the mainstream feminist circles combine, Angela Hatteryová, lecturer, Professor of women's and gender studies question at George Mason University, says that their predecessors have done the opposite.
Between the years 1865 and 1890, it was at least 10 000 blacks lynčováno and the reason was, in almost all cases the rape of white women, "said Hatteryová.
To justify the lynching you needed the cooperation of white women.
According to the Hatteryové schism between white women and černoškami came when the right to vote as the activist Susan b. Anthonyová examine the end of the 19th century. century terrain and realize that the electoral law can have only one group of people — women or blacks.
"Decided to put the cards on the right to vote for women, and on the right for blacks to focus later on," explained Hatteryová.
When you realize this, we gain important insight as to why white women, women of color do not believe.
We didn't distract the good work.
We never černoškám did not help protect their spouses and children.
Even after women in 1920, gained electoral law, it took ten years before began to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern women for the prevention of lynching.
The Group was founded 40 years after black women for the first time said about help.
According to Mitchellové surge response of white feminists on the issues that brought in Fergusonu-question the behavior of the police, racial discrimination-reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" questions that black women were experiencing a generation.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists on these areas [of traditional feminism] take the right to raise a child as seriously as taking the right to contraceptives?" Mitchell has suggested.
A second wave of feminists, that career fight for reproductive rights and access to contraception, now finding what it means.
Significant feminist activists like Gloria Steinemová have taken two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown to attack Facebook, where the published column from the guardian Carrollové Rebecca, which demanded that white Americans to forcefully protested against racism.
"I hope that women that have different, yet similar reasons for the understanding of the risk in the company-and views on race, which polls markedly different-will seek to change," wrote Steinemová.
Although Steinemová takes intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the question of race in America, some people confuse.
From the American Enterprise Institute specialist Christina Sommersová, author of the book '' who stole feminism? ", she said, for She The People that young men in the United States, mostly young people, men, are" much more vulnerable than their sisters, "but notes Steinemové parties Fergusonu facing criticism, which has raised previously.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but hardly any for the boy.
But when the White House started a small program to My Brother's Keeper, that should help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it triggered in many feminists including Gloria Steinemové angry response.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem, which is getting into the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the u.s. border police arrested this year in the southwest of the country almost 63 000 minors unaccompanied, again raised the question of the reform of immigration laws-this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercadová, spolupředsedající We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes the women for reform of immigration laws, she said that in order to be able to submit the question as necessary for women, the only thing she had to do was to share the stories of immigrants.
"Speak for themselves," says Mercadová.
Due to the fact that most of the work permit is granted to men, women who come with them, find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable with regard to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have in women's organizations, the response," she said.

An oral agreement with the employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not post from a doctor's confirmation of incapacity for work, which serves as a proof for the organization that you can't due to health reasons to perform work duties.
In addition, you are immediately notified in the absence of the employer.
Subsequently, although there was an agreement that the days will be recorded as a holiday, but the agreement was only verbally.
Although the labour code does not impose an obligation to leave in writing to confirm the employer's company holiday, in practice, this procedure proved.
If only the oral arrangement, you do not have the confirmation of the agreement.
Later may be the alleged agreement with the drawing vacation, as well as in your case, disowned and the absence of work assessed as fixed neomluvená absence, thus the reason for the immediate cancellation of the contract according to § 53 of the labour code.
In case of a dispute about the arrangement with the employer you are missing demonstrable proof.
Working with you, but the ratio has not been cancelled according to § 53, only you have the days listed in the credit worksheet as an Unexcused absence.
Neomluvená absence in credit worksheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. inability to receive material security in unemployment), however, is the increased difficulty of finding a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and let you in writing to confirm that it actually occurred as a result of an accident in which you were unable to work (it is not called. "arranging", only the document doctor).
When searching for a new job can be referred to the document submit and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate how to issue a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, so the early notification to the employer or to request written consent with the drawing on a vacation.
To avoid any complications.

18 got out of control, pulled out of the second turn and crashed into the Stewart, which sent both cars into the boards.
Stewart continued, but withdrew on 21. instead.
New Prague taxi administrator, earns a 12.3 million
Prague has finished the competitions on the new administrator of taxis.
For 103 parking spaces gets about 12.3 million crowns.
Recently, while in the same places for drivers of cars to taxi a year picking out 150 thousand crowns.
Inform the Councillor Luke Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously the city when choosing administrators used the draw.
The winner then has earned for a lump sum of CZK 1000 per year.
But the rules changed.
Currently decides the menu above.
"A year from the termination of the original tenancy agreements and launching competitions showed that new hiring system is far more profitable for Prague and fairer," says the Councillor.
The most expensive spot on Perštýně
The highest price offered to those interested in the street On Perštýně.
To pay 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns new administrators have paid for space in front of the Municipal House or on the Wenceslas square.
New rules for leasing of taxis Councillor received in the autumn of 2012, and in the summer of last year repudiated the original lease contract.
Competitions were held in four waves and the new Manager found 29 habitats.
For the second time this year, we had to clean the well.
The whole time we launched, which originated practically the second pond around the cabin.
Then we poured there Savo.
Incredible smell!
Our water well in the basement was always plenty of wonderful fragrant water.
And it was very professionally done, her grandfather vydlabal self-help.
A long time ago.
Was just on the three rings and the overall quirky, as everything in the cabin, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we open the season, of course, we have run out of water.
When there was a number of months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed to us that the water somehow smell.
We thought, if there's something to drop.
In the place where the pump, it was with a bit of bad luck it was possible there had been quite a plate, so a hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection has confirmed that brick moved.
Otherwise, in the water, there was nothing to see, and we prosvítili to the bottom.
So we have launched it again and přečistili.
Of course, we've improved the improvised seal around the pipe to the pump.
In the cellar we noticed but strange things.
On the ground lay sticky and the package with some diced.
So it seemed.
And further more.
Now it looked like a oslintaná mouse.
On the ceiling, in places where there are vents, Grandpa's invention, the remains of the fish!
And heavily jeté!
Our cellar is too racy.
Some would say that Grandpa simply podhrabal chat.
And he wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor is just a udusaný sand, only the ceiling is podbitý.
They're mainly there ships.
And the wheels.
And sun beds on the beach.
Doors with wide spaces were mostly open, as there is in one piece, someone walked.
Several of the already mentioned the ceiling vents.
Without a network, so there are commonly zalétávají in the rafters and birds built nests.
Of mice is useless to mention.
Grandpa wanted it to luftovalo, and it did it again.
Now, however, neither luft helped.
The whole cellar páchnul.
We have cleaned up the whole basement.
Especially the fish on the girder was nutritious!
We fired things were around: boards, heraklitovou plate, and so on.
Our cottage at a distance greeted passers-by with a disinfectant, pungent.
We were thinking, who are these disgusting there could drag them to the remains?
The nearest cat lives two miles away in the village.
Difficult to us she was snacking.
A man attacked a neighbor that is not quite right.
If you are Leeann he profanity there nešoupnul vent?
There's practically throughout the year, dumb ideas, that he has.
We decided to watch the well in the cellar and regularly checked.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We began to use water, yet only for washing and washing before they finished the tests, but it was good.
Pull the water from the forest edge is nothing, what I wanted to do something for a long time.
Once we heard a terrible baying dismay of our bitches.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw in the grass next to the porch a long thick black hose.
Réza bounced over it and squealing like crazy.
My mom called her, because she thought Réza dig waste hose from the sink.
But at the same time the hose is partially smotala into a ball and partially straightened.
On the balcony over the hiss.
Réza got hysterical.
We came down.
Corn snake, long a lot of over a meter and fat býkovec, was about to swallow a toad and her Réza resisted.
It was not clear if she wanted to save Toad or if she wanted to eat alone, but it was irrelevant.
When the snake saw numbers in the form of our entire family, I think she said, whether it's well sežereme when we such hladi, and elegantly stretched vent into the cellar.
We flew behind her.
As the lightning jumped as well.
By the way, we have noticed on her plate for more smelly package.
According to smell fishy around.
The day before yesterday there was not!
Our new security around the pump was a little wonky.
And we lock the cellar during the day.
That would ...
We went out there and we each Dove to one duct.
We didn't expect a long time.
For Wells, it's zašramotilo.
First appeared flat header with yellow marigolds around his neck.
Then he jumped on well the entire snake.
Wrapped around the pump and started to dig in.
The employee was fired, the company bought laptops and is sold
After release of the spurned employee bought on the company computer and then sold.
The money raised before the retention by the police managed to spend.
Within a short time the man bought in twelve cases for a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"The laptops after the takeover took to Olomouc, where it is sold after the bazaars," said Police Commissioner Šumperk Rostislav Brückner.
The fraud was motive revenge employer for release and also gain money.
"When questioning the us claimed that the money used on loan repayments," said Bruckner.
The police also found that the cheater is the pathological player who repeatedly was treated to a psychiatric ward.
The money could end up in the slot machines or in the videoloterijních terminals.
"The fact is that we have not found any money for it," said the Commissioner.
Hacker, who was once punished for theft, now threatened with incarceration of one year up to five years.
The police so far did not express whether or not there is also a bazarům penalty that price bought laptops and is sold.
"It is true that pick up the brand new goods, which is at least suspicious," said the Commissioner.
None of the owners of the Bazaar, however, has not been charged.
Come on, a little bit more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year the organizers have prepared us a few changes.
The biggest change was the route that brought the goal on the shallows instead of led back to the Yellow bath.
I was looking forward to the race, along with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to spend a little bit of the other side.
With the whole team we decided to personally salute our readers on the stand, where we took pictures and filmed the video together.
Your view from the other side to get to perfection, I accepted the role of the individual conductors.
Together with my friend Katya we just before the start of the end of the corridor included the obediently, 60 to 70 minutes.
We were greeted with the buddies who around us through to the sector for the faster runners.
I had a lot of time.
A couple of tricks to warm you up, turn on the sporttestery, and start the countdown!
The cries of rejoicing, but instead of the quick start was followed by scuttling to the starting line.
After five minutes we come to the gate, measuring and engaging rozbíháme pace for one hour ten.
Proplétáme with yellow snake runners Bs who, like running your first race.
Yet they look all lush, slowly decreasing the Sun in the sky adds perspective to the Vyšehrad almost trashy casts.
Throbbing meat stretching along the waterfront looks as though here she ran the whole Prague.
On the waterfront, between Vyšehrad Castle and the national theatre are traditionally begins to manifest, who has how many forces.
Lightweight scoop on palacký square forces many runners slow or go to walk away.
Just before přeběhem to the theatre to see a police escort, and right behind him going into the V.a. Pavlišta at an incredible pace goals.
I can hear the worshipful ufuněné sighing of the other runners.
Moving to the edge of the track, I urge him to slap me, but just before I podvrtne foot and our hands just to pass.
Seběh Theatre Street gives the chance for a brief rest and breathe.
Is needed before us are the places where my views take your breath away.
Turn on Mánesově bridge shows the threshold in the whole beauty of the setting sun.
Nedýchám me and my legs are almost on their own.
For the first občerstvovačkou is the moment of truth.
When Katya škobrtne roads overrun on the curb and jump full-length dive.
I'm looking to see if need help, and initiating a series of stimulating words that had no time to think about the pain.
It rises and we continue the goat down the aisle, it is one of the narrowest points of the track, at this stage of the race here, although not such a rush, but still need a good watch around.
I don't know yet, that the concept of the narrowest place gets its real meaning later.
In the Dirt by a wildly cheering us tourists and friends of the other runners.
I'm trying to clap with anyone who offers a hand, and I suggest it's because ten clapping with the fans is like half the energy bars.
The fact it works again zrychlujeme and although we are pretty much failed, now began fighter ride.
We're ahead of dozens of runners when passing someone particularly tired, I try to encourage him in a few words: "come on, a little bit more, you can do it!"
For the last občerstvovačkou we nepředbíhá, zrychlujeme.
So far, we ran for an hour and a quarter, we add, not on what to expect.
Three kilometres to the finish will be hurt, but the need is really máknout.
The sun slowly sank and ending day symbolically slowly kills the plant.
The last run on the bridge, sweep and just straight into the goal.
The pace of the run, which amazes me, where it takes in a girl?
"Come on, let's go under an hour thirteen, boys!" call.
We sprintujeme and here is the target.
An hour and thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what I can do.
The coach has the limit of an hour twenty.
So seven minutes under the plan.
Which is a super result.
Just behind the target's legs I'm knackered!, helping her to the railings, where while resting.
To see her is exhaustion, but also the happiness of the well paid performance.
After a while I slowly out of the area.
Euphoria does not give us to think of the crush in the passes to the cloakrooms.
Here it is seen that Goat lane was the narrowest place.
The aim here is to náplavka, which is under the onslaught of nearly ten thousand runners packed to the bursting point.
If someone does not like crowds, it's not the place for him.
After a while I lose my head and I wonder if those wonderful views and a more interesting route as compared to the previous years was worth it, what's going on in the goals.
From my own experience I know that organising a race is no fun.
If one adds to this the ten thousand people, a rich accompanying program and completion of the entire city center for all transport, is a huge challenge.
This year's route change has many interesting posts, runners but also produced some really unpleasant surprise.
Excellent atmosphere rozpumpovaná in yellow is shifted between the runners in the race.
Organizers around the track, as well as random viewers it stupňovali on each subway line.
When you run the historic center of the city, unfortunately, must count with obstacles that cannot be deleted, but the goal of mass factory in a place that is bounded by a wall on one side and on the other by the River, I do not find the best solution.
If you say that the race ended up proběhnutím goal, I rate it as a very hilarious.
For the goal I had a little fear about the health of the participating, but in the end everything turned out well.
Write to us for discussion, if you liked the route and what you say on the situation in the finish.
Prison guards organised protests in Bulgaria
Hundreds of employees of the prison service in Bulgaria participated in the nationwide protest rallies in front of the Justice Ministry in the capital Sofia.
The peaceful demonstration reiterated their request to the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which in recent times have changed.
On the list of requirements that have to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov, are even higher salaries.
The peacekeepers a month symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty hour conversions.
Although prison officers unions, and representatives of the Ministry of Justice agreed with the met, has informed the Bulgarian national radio (BNR).
"Negotiations are still ongoing," said the BNR head of the Directorate-General of the prison service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is expected that the protests of employees of the prison service also connects members of the Federation of trade unions of workers of the Ministry of the Interior.
Why the universe can have multiple dimensions, and we do not see
Physicists usually do not write bestsellers, but Brian Greens from Columbia University in 1999, has shot into the black.
His book the elegant universe has become the most accessible way for the layman how to penetrate the thicket of problems, which today deals with many theoretical physicists-an attempt to unite the two great works, but mutually incompatible discoveries 20. century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe, no doubt, is that in the case of search of a unified physical theory is not about a boring story.
Physicists the basic issue between two key theories (indeed, at this moment, is our universe a de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) address and addresses so imaginatively that it's worth retelling, and amateurs.
Greene's complex material in addition, advised so fresh and engaging, you cannot blame him, how much interest did not include in your book.
In addition, his "mistake" from the greater part of it in the other two books: the structure of the universe and Hidden reality.
Apparently not even the author would complained against it, if his book zastarávala faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, still provides the elegant universe almost anything substantial, what would an informed layman with the ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of the theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years will be in this area, yet just a little more (perhaps due to the fact that the accelerator the LHC will finally on "full throttle"), and so it is a good time to enter into the Green peacefully open doors in the world of modern physics.
How many sizes can have our universe?
The idea that our universe has perhaps more than three spatial dimensions certainly may sound silly, fantastic, strange or mystical.
Yet it is specific and completely acceptable.
To understand this, and for a moment his eyes from the universe as a whole to something přízemnějšímu, specifically to the long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that you had a garden hose either from one side of the Canyon to the other, and all of the scenery you are watching from a quarter of the distance (as in the picture, and on the following page).
From such a distance easily notice a long horizontally stretched a hose, but if you're just bystrozrakostí, the thickness of the hose can hardly.
Due to its great distance from the hose, you would think that Ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension, which can browse: left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the Ant at any given moment, you answer just one indication: distance of ants from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say only that a quarter of the distance looks like a long piece of hose as a one-dimensional object.
In the real world has a thickness of hose.
If everything we increase through suddenly the second measure-in the shape of a circle about the hose.
In the zoomed view is clear, that the ant actually can move in two independent dimensions: in the already well known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in/anti clockwise direction", i.e. around kruhovéhoprůřezu hose.
You understand that to determine the position of a small mravenečka you must enter two numbers: how far is it from the end of the hose and the hose on the swirling circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is a two-dimensional (note. Experts perceive that this chapter focuses purely on the fault string theory.
Neporuchové discusses aspects 12. and 13. Chapter.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by an arrow, the dimension directly in the direction of the circuit, marked with a circular arrow, is short and coiled up.
Between these two measures is, however, a clear difference.
Dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
Measure the circumference of the swirling hose is short, "coiled" and less noticeable.
To the existence of a radial dimension is realized, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates an important property of the spatial dimensions.
That are divided into two groups.
May be either a large, sprawling, and, therefore, directly visible, or small, coiled and much less noticeable.
Of course, in that case we just nepředřeli us "together" about the thickness of the hose dimension uncovered.
Enough to take to help the telescope.
But if the hose has been thinner-like hairs or capillary-, together we just uncovered a dimension with great effort.
Posted by Kaluza in 1919, Einstein your article, in which he published a stunning idea of the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions known to all of us.
His radical assertion to justify the Kaluza by additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing the framework within which can be Einstein's general relativity and the theory of electromagnetic Maxwellovu weave your into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Once touted as the question of how this Kaluzův point, together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer that Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and you clearly expressed and clarified the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the statement that the spatial geometry of our universe can have as large, so i curled up dimensions.
This means that as well as the dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose is also our universe is large, wide and slightly visible in three dimensions, whose existence you realize every moment.
But by analogy with the circular perimeter of garden hose universe may have additional dimensions curled up into a tight space so tiny that has so far remained hidden from our most experimental aparaturami.
In order to obtain a clearer picture of the nature of Kaluzova remarkable design, let's stay a little longer in the hose.
Imagine that on the perimeter of the hoses we draw the relatively thick series of Black circles.
From a distance it looks increasingly like a thin hose 1-dimensional line.
With a telescope now thanks to the artwork we have more dimension, together we'll see a theme from Figure 2.
Clearly we can see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one large and almost unlimited dimensions and with the other short and round.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but except for one small circular dimension has three large spatial dimensions, so čtyřiprostorovédimenze together.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To your imagination a little help, note the illustration on fig. 3; shows two large and one small round dimension dimension.
The image sizing on the geometry of space, like squatting surface of the hose.
Each following level, represents a huge increase from the level of the previous space geometry.
Our universe may have the additional dimension (we see is on the fourth level of magnification), if they are svinuty to the little enough space; It is explained that we did not observe directly is not yet.
Square network shows the commonly known "big" dimension, while the circle of a new, tiny, and together the dimension.
Just like the loops of thread in a densely utkaném carpet, these circles are there in every place of the usual proportions-we just because of suggestive power zakreslili only to the intersections in the square network.
Figure 4 shows the background commonly known the structure of space-the ordinary world around us-in such common scales, such as feet, as shown aside a small diamond in a square network.
On each of the following picture, we will focus on a small area of the image of the preceding; We will increase it to become visible.
Initially, nothing happens, as we see in the first few levels of magnification.
However, when we turn on its way for the microscopic properties of the geometry of space on-to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3-a, we suddenly new, into the shape of the circle together, similar to the dimension of the thread loops in densely homespun piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions, like the hose has a circular perimeter in every point of its length.
In the interest of the suggestive power we have a circular dimension zakreslili only in certain, regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 Kaluzovu and Kleinovu idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of space sums up.
The similarity with the hose is clear, though, is even important differences.
First of all, the universe has three large, sprawling far spatial dimensions (from which we drew only two), while the hose has a large size one.
Even more important, the difference lies in the fact that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, rather than just about any subject in the universe, should be our hose.
The basic idea is the same.
If there is an additional dimension a circularly extremely miniature, recognize it as a circular perimeter of hose-much harder than to observe the obvious, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the extra dimensions small enough to reveal her will in fact, even beyond our State of the art tools to increase.
The most important is that the additional dimension is not merely rounded hrbolkem inside the normal dimensions of how a two-dimensional illustration falsely suggests.
Circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at every point of the three common large proportions.
It is a dimension on the remaining three dimensions independent as well, such as the dimensions of the top-down, left-to-right and front-back independent (and perpendicular to) each other.
Small enough mraveneček could move in all four dimensions and to determine his position we need four data, in addition to the three usual even position in a circular dimension; If we count the time data, then five, in any case, one more than we would normally expect.

The price for the e-book is 149,-CZK.
To our surprise, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, shows Kaluzovo and Klein thought that this does not preclude the existence of additional dimensions of twisted, if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than how many can be seen by the naked eye.
How small should be?
State of the art technical equipment can detect the structure of large billionth billionths of a meter.
The smaller dimension curled up as soon as we can observe.
In 1926, the original Kaluzův Klein idea combined with a few thoughts from the currently emerging quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that an additional circular dimension could have a size approximately one Planck length, i.e. the size of the far beyond the resolution of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists call the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluzovou-Kleinovou theories.
Wohnout Jack Habib advises how to practice on electric guitar: part 5.
The whole essence of "the twelve" rests in the dvanáctitaktové harmonic form, which you can freely again.
Who grope in music theory, explained in detail its principle finds here.
Jan Homola, or Jack Homolka Capsule (1976)
Education puppeteer and loutkovodič, whose Facebook profile can be monitored here, from the school twenty years ago, works as a graphic designer.
Is the guitarist of the band Waters from which the supposedly not to leave.
The guitarist's father, as well as brother Matthew, the leader of the Wohnoutů.
With training, start on one string.
"The rhythmic model is on you, you can think of anything, you just need to apply it on a harmonious model of beer," says Jack.
When you add another chord, you can again change the figure.
You just need to listen to and watch John, what I can with dvanáctkovou harmonies on two strings to invent and how nicely it's starting to sound like.
Just where the third chord, you can already flirting with tunes for some songs.
Until finally you add a fourth, careful to change the tuning, notes John in the video.
The next time Jack returns to pentatonice and try to put together it's just with the 12.
So it honestly exercise.
How best to read it in an interview with John Homolou at the first lesson of his school games on an electric guitar here.
Next goal without waiting?
On a big celebration, it's not recognizing hradecký Dvořák
Point we take and we are happy for him.
The first half we had more chances and we, the second home, "he told the striker, who scored from the penalty kick this time.
Weren't you nervous when its brinkmanship, but it was accompanied by huge Squeak?
I particularly did, though on the other gate, where the home fans, it would probably be worse.
Penaltou you up after half an hour, but you've also got a goal from a penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
Did we start, we were passive, originated from the corner and then scored.
After you have picked up and the first half were a better team, which had more of a chance.
Why has it changed after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played after inkasovaném goal to break well.
In the cabin, we have said that we want to keep up the pace and after the game, but we couldn't do it.
To tell the truth, even I can't explain why.
But it is probably also true that home on break, something to say about his game with her were not too happy.
On the pitch the opponent you're only scored points for the first time, while at home, you still need to get even a goal.
Why is it such a difference?
I wouldn't say that it's such a difference, the more it depends on us, on how to deal with it.
In Brno, we started well, but then it was bad for us, Plzeň, that's a different category.
Four games you expect to score a goal, you shouldn't fear that, after the last match may be similar?
Perhaps not, but of course we are pleased that since the last match we don't have to talk about waiting for a goal to listen to.
Now we've added more without waiting, but they are still just three in six matches, which is not even on the big celebration.
Lava flows from the Iceland-miles of the crater.
The lava to the surface in the area of Goring Holuhraun near Vatnajökull glacier, flows through an underground tunnel from the miles of the crater.
This is located under the glacier, as well as part of the above-mentioned subterranean lava tunnel.
This fact worries most scientists now...
The situation for the time being remains constant.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) is still coming out of the cracks in approximately the same quantities of lava.
Compared to the original estimates, however, its quantity is less than 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times greater.
However, scientists fear that the lava tube could open even in places where it is located under the ice.
If they did so, moreover, with a similar intensity, which shows the current eruption, it would mean a huge floods, both on the river Jökulsá á Fjöllum, so on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption is to feel a strong sulfur smell, clouds of steam rising from cracks and gases.
It is definitely not an eruption that is suitable for tourism, as was the case in the event of an eruption at Fimmvörðuháls pass in 2010.
This is a much larger and also there's a lot more gas, "says vulkanolog Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has greatly improved since yesterday, in the morning there was almost no wind in the area.
Traces of sand storm were washed away by rain.
Researchers can continue their work.
For air operations is the Orange stage (second highest) for the Bárðarbungu and the yellow (the third) for Askju.
The sky above was the brave Lady Peggy Cheb.
Passed after the wings
Airshow in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 was introduced air Acrobat Peggy Walentinová, who climbed from the cockpit during a flight to the horizontal bar on the top wing of a biplane, and also between the wings.
There is dependent only on the strength of the muscles.
The Airshow was held in Cheb this year already for the fifth time and the organisers are once again managed to prepare some interesting air pieces.
The premiere of the oldest Czech's airport had not only "walk after the wings" in bringing the two German Peggy Walentinové, but also the legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or aircraft Beechcraft 18.
The one on the attention his bright skin.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking has its origin in the USA.
After the 1. World War, sought to impose so many former military pilots.
But due to the large number of fatal accidents has been disabled.
Today, but slowly returns to the air days.
Peggy after takeoff climbs from the cockpit at the top of the wing.
There is a variety of exercises.
At the end of speeches will move into the space between the wings of the airplane, where her show goes on, "described by Luděk Matějíček from Cheb Ultralight Club, and the organizer of Airshow.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband, Friedrich.
If the performances of Peggy was the main highlight of the program, then the following performance Mustang fighters was icing on the proverbial cake.
The legendary fighter came on the screen with the Grippeny of the army of the Czech Republic in tow (said to be on the numbers).
Such a report could air fans in the Czech Republic to see for the first time.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then demonstrated breathtaking acrobatics with aircraft of 1945.
During the war, was produced, but probably never did.
He was included in the military reserves.
Since 1963, he worked in the civilian sphere.
As a racing aircraft.
Today, has its home at the airport hangar in Mnichovo Hradiště.
On the same site is also another Pearl of the Cheb Airshow, twin-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, a huge machine did not go overlooked.
Its polished aluminum skin shone in the distance.
The admiration he's machine Max Holste Broussard MH-1521M in the colors of the French air force.
A small airliner was taken aback for odřeknutý L and from German Hof, bringing part of the German delegation at the Airshow.
German neighbors in Cheb with the reconstructed aircraft demonstrated How 18T or a formation biplanes Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhyová: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
Parental worries exchanged Lucie Borhyová at least for tonight, for those working.
Stress or nervousness-blonde presenter obviously knows nothing of it.
MC: television news she went well, as would be with him for two months at all stopped!
It's only been two weeks, what the blonde one ended in the post-natal period, in which experiencing women after childbirth the most stress.
Lucie, however, in the main session of TV Nova still regularly show will be.
Regular return it waits for the information to Blesk.cz per month.
After all, her daughter Linda now needs more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhyová returned to the tv screen and it was shot into the black.
Exhibition for the year in Prague?
Hall would sell out, is planning a sleepover Jagr
It would be a decent, if something like that was done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how it will stand up to the Union, "he said after the exhibition in Jihlava, named the Golden match, in which he again reunited the breathtaking naganský team.
Even the players who participated on a golden Hattrick.
The players would have had that taste?
I'm sure.
In short, it would be good to make a farewell to the golden generation during the Championships.
According to me you can find one during the tournament two days ago, when it is full off and where could such a match, mingle.
We tell Gumovi (George Šlégrovi) or Béďovi Ščerbanovi (organizer of the Jihlava match), who would have taken care of the ...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with the New Jersey playoffs?
So when I arrive to ...
But you don't want to play in the team.
Or Jihlava meeting somehow amended your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things, and in the representation are crucial performances.
One thing is that people like to see me there, but the performances are crucial, especially for the World Cup.
There should be players who ride on it, and not because they have a good name.
My decision is not changed.
As you actually enjoyed it naganské reunion?
Only the meeting with the players was great.
A man revived the stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans but also for the us hockey team.
However, the most important was a tribute to Ivan Hlinkovi.
And it is good to remind us of the history of our hockey, and that leaves one generation, that it really was.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimir Ruzicka and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.
He has yet to replicate his first representative match?
Such things are forgotten.
It was against the Calgary Flames, and three young: I, Robert Holik and Robert Reichel, we boarded in a threesome.
For all, it was the first official start.
Well but that we somehow dominated, so I can't say.
After a long time in Jihlava fielded Dominik Hašek.
What did you say his performance?
Hašan me on the ice never surprised.
I wanted him to give it back with that critique, but I can't (Jagr, Hasek was criticized for reasons why he decided to quit in the representation). Zachytal just fine.
I showed great Hnilička.
While he was with me one night and wish he was there is full of holes.
And now fielded famously.
At first the us and then the Netherlands, which begins with a qualification
To smíchovskému NH Hotel on Monday morning took the prominent guests.
People could see the need to goalkeeper Petr Cech of Chelsea, national coach Paul Vrbu the ...
And over there, the figure in a black baseball cap, this is Tomas Rosicky!
Arsenal midfielder and captain of the team arrived at the meeting point between the last around half-past eleven.
We have a beautiful game against the Netherlands.
Who would he? "he said, speaking in the retail kit, appearing before reporters.
The program of the Czech national team
Monday 1. September: the beginning of the meeting, the first training
Tuesday, March 2. September: training open for fans (18: 30, Letná) book signing (20: 00)
Wednesday 3. September the Czech-u.s. (20: 15, Letná)
Tuesday, 9. September the Czech Republic-Netherlands (20: 45, Letná) the end of the meeting
Rosického a spol. fans can support before Wednesday's match against the United States (20: 15).
Representation for them had opened Tuesday's training, which starts at the 18: 30.
And it will be followed by a book signing that Rosicky will be even Bohemia.
Otherwise, this will be a meeting of the national team calmer.
Which speaks highly of coach's Willow, who is currently on a number of social events at the spring complained.
Finally, we will pay what we pay.
Now we will focus on the Netherlands.
Is an advantage when you have the players together for eight days.
We will have time to repeat things that up until now, not much time, "said Willow, who officially leads the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be at the entrance to the new qualifying cycle, accompany the mušketýrská image.
Under the willow tree representation for three matches, all preparatory.
With Norway and Finland remizovala 2: 2, and Austria lost 1: 2.
These results, however, were not important.
It's up to now.
The match with the Netherlands, will kick off the qualification process for the 2016 European Championship.
The Czech team would of course help if i had a dress rehearsal against the us.
The first half was that we met.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about it, we were successful, "said Willow.
The only player of the třiadvacetičlenné nomination, who has health problems, striker David Lafata.
Is the temperature.
If they missed the Wednesday match against heal us, coach would be called Willow one attacker.
Genetic disorders are often poorly diagnosed
A woman from the uk describes how after the wrong diagnosis for many years thought to die.
Then, what was diagnosed with a disease, she spent most of the teenage Rodgersová Karin in the belief that only a few years of her life.
In fact, it was about the Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT)-a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
CMT UK charity organization said that a bad diagnosis is between people with CMT common problem because of illness, knows very little.
It is considered that, in the United Kingdom suffer from CMT approximately 23 000 people, which may exhibit symptoms in the field of motor skills such as muscle weakness, clumsy walk and twisted the toes.
For affected may also occur numbness or pain, this status is neléčitelný, and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgersové was thirteen, she thought, that suffer from Freidreichovou ataxia (FA)-a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that will celebrate the eighteenth birthday, will be tethered to a wheelchair, and dead, than she will be 30.
The mother of two children who is now 51, says: "as a child I knew, that I can't do the same things as everyone else.
Every day I dropped everything and took me longer.
I never could with the other children ride on roller skates or a skateboard and I was picked on at school because, as I walked and ran. "
When he was thirteen and was Rodgersové after a few operations which should release her Achilles tendon and straighten the foot, took advantage of the fact that her doctor left the room, and peered into their dossiers, where they learned that suffer from FA.
"I felt guilty, because I snuck around, and so I told anyone, but when I returned home, I found the information about the disease in the library and I wrote to the Association of the FA," he says.
When I answered, I was in shock, I panicked.
I thought that before I will be eighteen, I end up in a wheelchair, and before me will be twenty-five, I'll be dead, and in the meantime lose all your skills gradually.
I was completely alone and I planned a funeral. "
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk is worsened as much as expected, and said that his surgeon.
Just stood up, hugged her and said, "honey, I don't think the disease you have, otherwise you would have been in a wheelchair.
I think it will be something much less lethal. "
After graduating from several genetic tests revealed that has CMT.
"When I explained what CMT is, I thought, that I am a child of fortune," she said.
CMT UK charities launched a month of awareness of of CMT, to this disease pointed out.
Entrepreneurs in the area of Washington: with a turnover of economy rising taxes
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey, which was published last week, State and local taxation of companies in the country with the acceleration of recovery in the economy increased slightly last year and the company in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia together for fiscal year 2013 into State and local treasuries did 27.6 billion dollars, which is about 3.8% higher amount than 26.6 billion dollars in 2012.
Tax-State and local-the last year rose by 4.3% to 671 billion dollars in comparison with 3.9% last year and this was the third year in a row of growth after years of 2009 and 2010, when the tax is reduced.
According to the study, conducted by a professional firm of Ernst and Young's political grouping & Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased by 4.3%, faster than the local charges, by 3.9%.
More than half of the tax revenue of the precinct, 56% is from the business tax, and 36% of the revenue is from Maryland companies.
Virginia, with 28%, has the smallest proportion of tax revenues from the business.
Researchers claim that the majority of the growth of the tax revenue comes from the increase in the value of real estate belonging to the firms, which property taxes this year after three consecutive years with the growth of-1% increased by 3.7%.
Although most of the profit comes from the large States such as California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same situation is in Washington.
Companies in the D.C., Maryland and Vriginii last year, paid over $ 10 billion in State and local taxes from real estate, which in comparison with 9.6 billion in 2012, represents an annual increase of 4.2%.
The apparent increase in real estate values, however, so does not force up State and local tax revenue in Maryland, where the estate tax represents less than one-fifth of company taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C. property tax represents almost half of the State and local taxation.
"In a lot of their own real estate companies in Maryland, especially in and around the D.C. tax base, Government, or non-profit organizations that do not pay taxes," explained Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other States.
The recent increase in tax revenue from the business cannot be attributed only to the uzdravujícímu, the real estate market.
According to the data, it appears that the revenue of the business is also increasing.
Companies in this region to make income tax companies $ 2.3 billion, which increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland income tax on companies, a $ 1 billion, the most in the region.
While moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on business owners does not grow in these three places just as quickly.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the level of the national average, at 4.3%, while the growth of Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was the increase of taxation below the average, at 4.1%.
Virginia has all three circuits (all of which have the same taxation) the lowest taxation of commercial companies, 6%.
The rate of company taxation in Maryland is 8.25%, whereas the average D.C. remains relatively high, at 9,975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the American Chamber of Commerce, showed that Virginia has a lower State and local taxation and overall more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.c. studies nehodnotila.
Despite this advantage is facing the pressure of competition from Southern Virginia.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing the tax business companies from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax is reduced to 5%.
If you will be in the coming year to continue to meet the revenue targets, could be in 2017 statutory rate of income taxation to reduce by up to 3%.
According to recent studies, small businesses in Washington leads to better, and therefore pay higher State and local taxes.
The trade tax borne by small businesses such as personal income tax-raising compensation cost structure by raising prices, which is organised by most companies-in D.C., Maryland and Virginia last year increased by 20% to $ 2.4 billion, far faster than other taxes.
Researchers claim that the trend and national business tax increases are likely to continue next year, the total tax revenue from the sale of State and local governments are compared over the same period last year, the first three quarters of the year 2014 will increase to 6.2%.
Washington, however, beyond the others fall behind, because of the reduction of State expenditure is taking its toll on the labour market.

The reality is překrucovaná subtitles
That the media distortion of reality, with subtitles is not (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know that "sell" newspaper, but unfortunately, I also know that many so-called "readers" who do not read anything else.
And it is a fact that bothers me very recently, more is more the word sucks.
This concerns, in particular, articles about the conflict Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Quite common are the headlines "Israel attacked Gaza."
Only in the text read, that the Israeli "attack" was a response to a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip, and it's often in time of declared a truce.
It then appears the caption "both sides have violated the ceasefire".
He realizes that the journalist community, its procedure is directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that throughout Europe (and not only there) on the increase?
Only sixty years after the end of the 2. During World War II.
Still living people, survivors of the Shoah.
When I saw the videos of the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted slogans of "Jewish sow" and similar zhůvěřilosti, froze at me.
It wants the world to finish what Hitler failed?
They realize our journalists to the fact that after the Jews have been designated for the liquidation of the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care to their work.
You are often referred to as "watchdogs of democracy".
So it's obhajujte.
As long as there is.
And obhajujte also the right of a really democratic State in the Middle East to protect their populations.
How would you like to preserve our Government, if any of our neighbors decided to dispose of the Czech nation and the Czech Republic clears from the map of the world?
Maybe you also should recognize one fact.
On the territory of the State of Israel is almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship.
And they are there as well.
When you ask them why they don't go between "my", the answer should be in Gaza will, why would they do that?
In Israel they have to work, social security and health care top (I saw with my own eyes how to top private hospitals Hadassa, which is financed through donations from Jews all over the world, commonly goes even Arabs and there are, of course, treated).
Hamas for its missile attacks on its Arab brothers.
The only real aid to Gaza, and to this troubled area, it is getting rid of Hamas and disarm it.
And not denouncing Israel, albeit indirectly, in the headlines.
Check on the practices of Hamas, about his abuse of people as human shields.
Please inform that Hamas aims to liquidate the State of Israel, and this at any price.
Even at the cost of death of innocent Arab children.
Please inform that Hamas is on the list of the world's terrorist organizations.
Please inform that in nine years of self-government in Gaza could be this area flourishing thanks to the humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even Israel, which supplies water and electricity, for which, however, does not apply to Gaza and even administrators are angry that they are at this time, sometimes the power supply interrupted.
If Hamas has invested money into the construction of underground tunnels that could penetrate the suicide attackers on the territory of Israel, but to the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals and schools, would be his Arab brothers from Gaza significantly better.
Amazon buys a 1.04 billion dollar Twitch
AMAZON has just confirmed the claim Information from the Monday morning: Internet retailer-producer of videos and hundreds of other things-buys for 1.04 billion dollars (970 million u.s. dollars) video streamingovou service Twitch.
The notice sparked surprise not because no one would expect that someone buys Twitch, but because it is expected that the buyer will be YouTube.
Three months ago, he looked for one Google Twitche sale billion sure, and this seemed like a natural.
Twitch, which only three years ago, she founded Justin.tv, was primed to become a widely used video streamingovou service-live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players, who broadcast online coverage of the games-in the words of Business Insider "YouTube for live transmitted by playing".
Interaface Twitche.
They are already popular on YouTube video "Let's play", the kind where the mudrlanti (mostly older) games give Mystery Science Theater processing.
The fact is that YouTube when popisuTwitche comes to start a lot, so the news that YouTube, much kupujeTwitch didn't I turn, it was a textbook example of how established the company pays to the potential competition.
A mystery is why the agreement with YouTube came out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as the Amazon.
Everything we currently have available, is an expression of Emmet Sheara Twitche CEO: "we chose the Amazon, because they believe in our company, it has the same values and a long-term vision and wants to help us deliver it faster."
Another mystery is-frankly-incredible success Twitche.
For snobs like me, who claim that they do better than pursue the sport, it is hard to understand what is so great about the game instead of the actual playing just to observe.
It is one thing to look at three in the morning to a friend over his shoulder, playing Resident Evil, and a totally different thing is to observe how a stranger gets twenty interventions in the head in the Call of Duty.
All of the games that you could watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today's most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so to look at their record, without you could yourself perspective control is a pretty good recipe, how do you get a headache.
I admit, that game type speed run, in which Rogeři Bannisteři to our electronic time completes the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone is not playing or master of humor, its channel on the Twitch might not be very interesting.
But what about the skeptics like me to know?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is fourth on the top of Internet traffic.
Exactly how it makes use of the Amazon?
It is hard to imagine that the Twitch to stir in the Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as if it could swallow YouTube.
Twitch but it has something that would attract each company: the hordes of young men, that advertisers want.
As he told the Director, Amazon and Shear Twitche Twitch "believes in the future of gaming" and the media don't seem to be reluctant, or-gulp-viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of the American atheist vloggera Arona Ra.
This time on the theme of "the Holy Scriptures are the word of God."
Accompanied by the original video.
The second basic lies creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not the actual human authors.
When believers debate about one of the many things that are in conflict with their religion, often put before us the question: Who will you believe?
The alleged word of God or the word of a man?
As if human exploration was completely trivial compared with the authority which represent that their doctrine.
But when they say "a man", talks about the science.
And when the report to the "word of God", report to the myths about God by people.
If there is indeed a smart with tvořitel with some purpose, then it is he who created the fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic formula which correspond to, and it must be he who added another series of evidence which show exclusively for the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Otherwise why would all these things existed?
It seems as if we tried to say something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulovat.
And they were the people who wrote all the lyrics, they pretend that they are the word of God.
Each allegedly holy teachings of any religion in the world describes itself as written by people, not gods.
People who have been "moved" or "inspired by" your favorite gods, or listened to the recording angels, but those were not written texts anyone other than mere mortals with some degree of imagination, not angels and not gods.
If, indeed, there was one real God, he would have been an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-Galactic supergénius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If being of such a size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, all the Holy Scriptures.
It would be known everywhere in the world without predecessors, Parallels or alternatives in any language, because the mere human authors would be with such a work could not be measured.
And people would have to blindly believe, because it would be consistent, based on verifiable and true evidence, and would be a little deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
Permanently would be inspired by each reader to the unity of the common faith.
If God wrote it, we didn't expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite of.
Instead of a single religion, leading to the final truth we have many different religions without a common origin, and all are constantly getting more and more into separate denominations, seeking the disputed truth and each claims a divine guidance in some way, regardless of the ongoing divergence and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospel, Islamic Qur'an, Bahá ' u ' lláhův the Kitáb-i-Akdás, Zarathuštrovy of the Avesta, sikhský Order-Granth, Mahabharátská Bhagavad-Gita, the book of Mormon, or the book of Urantia are all considered to be "the absolute truth" and "the revealed Word of the one true God" and each of them by the believers say that the others are astray.
The only logical explanation is probably that astray are all to some extent.
None of the above mentioned books has no advantage over the other.
None of them does not have the burden of support and no is not historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, Professor of ancient history, and I'm on the Western Michigan University.
I'm not saying that I prove that the Bible is reliable and historical accurate.
Of course, it is not.
Still you have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also the apologia (Defense) because they contain irregularities, absurdity and primitive ideas once considered to be true, that have already been overcome.
So you cannot claim that they are evidence of the divine wisdom.
Many of them promotes the hideous atrocities instead of morality, and many of them claim that they have been confirmed by the fulfilment of a prophecy-with the fact that each can contain prophecy that either fulfilled was not.
The leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion have been written by human hands and are therefore subject to interpretation, perceptions and views of their primitive and often prejudices linked politically motivated authors to explain many of oxymora, and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I would not call it mutual contradiction, more comments.
We must again point out that here we have two different authors, whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revisions.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author, and is certainly not the story of an eyewitness.
Some experts now distinguishes between four different sources for the Pentateuch, i.e.. five books "of Moses" and Moses nepřipisují authorship of any of them, because almost certainly existed as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (possibly Ezdrášem) of several mutually unrelated oral traditions of less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents were přefiltrovány in the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea scrolls, the oldest archaeological findings of the texts are known for their unfinished Foundation of all Western monotheistic religions, and yet they are much younger than the roots of the zoroastriánství century, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, druidských cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a gnostická faith, followed docéti and ebionité and their very different views on Jesus, which eventually combined in a kind of compromise entitled orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups like the luciferiáni were scattered and discredited other revisions of the Bible.
One of these edit refers to the King of Ugarit who ruled from 3500 years ago.
Because his followers represented a major threat to young mojžíšké religion, the authors of the New Testament have decided to ridicule and Ba ' al Zebula, "Lord of the mountain" changed to "Lord of the flies" Beelzebub.
So, the Bible has been deliberately and fraudulently amended as from a religious as well as political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the new law was kanonizována in 4. century a.d. in a series of decisions on the komisních diet in Nikaji.
The four Gospels were taken and sixteen others were rejected by show of hands, as if the fact that some things could accept or reject the vote.
How Canon developed depended on what they read on Sundays in the Christian centers.
What to read on the second Sunday after Easter in Jerusalem church?
And what in the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually there that are close to those same evangelijním stories.
And so the core Canon of this usage evolved out of early Church.
So the Council just accepted as gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the nevzdělanými masses in that time.
But just as consciously removed more than ten books of the Bible, even though they referovaly books, which have been approved.
Among the rejected items we find the writings of the Apostles, the prophets, as well.
Why should us the word of God should refer to the books, which are just the words of some people and/or are not even available anymore?
Who was the real editor?
The Bible often refers to human authors.
But how could she be so approved, if God was the actual author of this haphazard jumble of tales, parables and a žalmové lyricism?
The Bible was written by human beings, and certainly not too osvíceními, rather the contrary.
This is the reason why it is so much part of its contents historically and scientifically completely wrong, whether it is about almost anything, from the beginning to the end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys can talk, believed in the incantations, the bloody sacrifice, ritual spells, potions, enchanted objects, the fiery, astrology, and the five elements of magic.
They thought that when you apply the magic wand, that someone sprayed blood, cures him of leprosy.
We are talking about people who think that rabbits are herbivores, and bats are birds and whales are fish and PI that is an integer.
These people believed that if they prove a pregnant cow striped patterns, stripes, to give birth to calves.
How could tell someone who knows something about genetics?
The authors of this book, of course, didn't know.
If the Bible was written by some higher being, then it did not contain such errors, what it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior beings, and was intended as a literal history, then it did not contain anything of what it contains.
As a moral guide to totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings was written nevzdělanými and bigotními the savages, who ignored or support cruelty to animals, incest, bondage, slave, abuse, abuse of the family, child abuse, violence against children, abortion, looting, murder, cannibalism, genocide, and prejudice against race, nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
In order to legitimize its inhumanity, claiming that held the will of God.
But the creationists continue to ignore all this.
Some of their Web sites acknowledge that if is any fact in conflict with the Bible, then it must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creationists had his beloved books, not even God.
In their world, and the second one is the same.
It is ironic that they refuse to "work of God" as "the worship of creation instead of the creator".
But they consider the word man for the word of God and God alone and even insist that the refutation of their supposedly "Holy" books somehow disproves God as such.
Their version of God but not all versions of the God.
Kreacionističtí Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible should at the same time could be wrong, because they fail to separate from the doctrine of the deity.
So it's a kind of idolatry, where the faithful worship the man produced the compilation, as if these books were God himself, because he thinks that is his word.

A smart way to save for higher education textbooks
Due to the fact that the price of college textbooks for many students is more than 1, 000 dollars a year came to the upcoming second edition of the student with a clever way to reduce costs.
He invented a system of lending books from classmates from upper grades with nominal compensation, hold the smugglers ' back to their sale.
"A book on the calculations, which normally costs $ 180, I'm on semester earned ten and chicken nuggets," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Books required in his final semester, would cost $ 430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the University Council, the average student will spend for textbooks and supplies for more than 1, 200 dollars a year, but the students have a variety of options on how to deal with these costs.
The preferred choice of students become Internet business and creative solutions as it is Schroederovo.
On the rise is the lending of textbooks, which allows students to use the book and this semester, often with a significant discount, than if it's bought.
Neebo Inc. operating more than 250 campus bookstore campuses says that lending books from 2011 doubled.
Exploration in the industry shows that around a quarter of the books in the University bookstores last spring semester was borrowed, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of teaching texts, according to the National Association of college stores in University bookstores buys.
Here's 101 best ways to succeed.
Online shopping
The prices of some of the new books may be on the Internet about a third lower than in the University Bookstore.
Recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetlera is nearly $ 290, but on the Internet it can be on Chegg.com, specialised retail, purchase a new textbook for 239,99 dollars.
Buy used

University teacher Ingrid Braceyová, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls suggests that the students with their teachers to verify whether they are older releases of the acceptable.
Sometimes the changes are not for the work of the seminars is essential.
If Yes, can an older Edition selling for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition Chegg and Amazon, are a popular alternative to buying used books also eBay Inc. 's Half.com.
Lending
For the consideration of půjčovaní is also worth of textbooks, if you treat them well, nezapomínáte is back and you don't need to have them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost for a new book.
For example, the student should be able to borrow the entire semester "Calculus" for about twenty dollars.
Familiarize yourself with the terms of the trade, in which book you rent, including penalties for notes, highlighting, or wear and tear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you book in time you return, the penalty may be higher than the price of new books.
E-book
Another option is to take the place of a normal book, e-book.
Sometimes these books essentially lend in the form of an electronic licence valid for a period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Barnes and Noble & Chegg Inc.
Chegg rents "Calculus" for six months for about $ 61.
According to Braceyové so you can find the best value for students of literary courses because many of the classics is now available for free download, while natural science and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, walk around the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who soon will begin at Pepperdine Law School, recommends that you follow the ISBN because it ensures that you are buying the correct book.
Before you order a book over the internet, make sure that it is really in stock, advises Gault.
Convinced about it on his own skin.

The mud, the same mud.
And then they found a torso in the well from the end of the war rifles
The well is situated a short distance from the Church of St. George.
We uncovered stand around and we started picking out aged coating-roughly a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
When we approached the jílovitému day, we hit the barrel, "recounted, Radomil Novák.
We pulled it, cleanse and have found that it is a fragment of the offensive the German rifles, which use SS.
Find is reportedly uncommon.
According to my information such rifles were produced up to the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand, "added Smith.
All wooden structural things to decompose over time, therefore, is unusable.
Her body is, however, preserved-holds its shape.
As in a well placed?
One explanation exists.
Maybe it was thrown to the people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the units of the SS, probably out of fear that they were not relegated.
The fascists on the run it would apparently not done.
Those who guns in the Woods, "he thinks the Finder.
The rifle was the only thing that freaks of Hnutí Duha Mountains found in the well.
"Could there be hand grenades, those here once was around a lot, so we slowed excavation work, we carefully prohmatávali the mud that happened some misfortune, but nothing else was down there," approached Smith.
Find ends up in the depository of the Museum at the castle in the nearby Silesian Rudolticích.
Ukrainian General: neosvobozoval I have so far Captured Čech
Exclusive interview with generálplukovníkem Currently by Volodymyr Rubanem, which exempts Ukrainian soldiers from captivity pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague-"excuse me, I have to take ... call me from Donetsk start," he apologized perhaps eight times in an exclusive interview with the Ukrainian Colonel aktuálně.cz Volodymyr Ruban, Director of the Centre also the liberation of prisoners of war.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in the tv debate.
When any such interruption was not able to hear the names of people, their numbers or the place where they are-or should be-that's Ruban specifies with its counterpart on the other end of the phone.
"That's it-go there," concluded one of the lightning in the discussions with Doněckem and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is the general waiting in the wings, a former fighter pilot and an active participant of protests by anti-Government elements on Maydan.
Yesterday-when we talk's interview was in Donetsk.
Liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from captivity pro-Russian separatists is devoted to twenty-four hours a day.
Currently the. cz: Maybe you know that on the side of the pro-Russian separatists fighting and the Czechs.
Our intelligence estimates their number to 30.
There may be, however, and much more.
Have you any Czech prisoner during your negotiations met?
Volodymyr Ruban: it frees the captured Serbs, Dagestánce, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians ... but not yet Available.
But I know who to contact in Prague if we stumbled upon your captured compatriot and rescue.
Ukrainian soldier captured the separatists
A.cz: what advice do you give the Czechs, who have added to the proruským separatists and Ukrainian soldiers are captured?
They should understand that as far as the Czechs are struggling in the Ukrainian praporech volunteers and the separatists is a catch, so after hearing of the shoot without mercy, as well as any other foreigners.
Separatists consider these men for rent mercenaries and according to them nothing's deserve nothing less than death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers are captured a group of separatists and doněckých between them, therefore even Cech-sit him behind bars and act with him as a prisoner.
The guy just survives.
Ukrainian party behaves in the war as a State.
A.cz: and how much you have managed to save Ukrainian prisoners of war?
If I understand, so in Exchange.
Some sources state that it had long ago crossed a hundred men.
Long ago we stopped to count, how many people we have helped.
But we just liberated ... before the war, saved, if they decide to continue fighting.
Rescuers are in a war, doctors, surgeons, but we definitely are not.
So it is.
And every day growing more and more.
Every day we can save someone.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And do not go on the Exchange.
Sometimes you just have to release prisoners, even the mere human appeal.
A.cz: Rumor has it that you gained in a few months with pro-Russian separatists even great authority and confidence ... as well as in the Ukrainian society.
How you managed to build respect of both warring parties?
A difficult question.
One of the officers in Kyiv gave me the nickname "mad General with steel balls".
Does not offend me.
And maybe it even captures the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian officer corps I have some authority obtained before.
Never nechytračím, and I'm always one word.
No matter what happens, so I am honest and I speak the truth.
Even though it is the Ukrainian Government, or that the Donetsk or luhanské very annoying.
If they torture and kill people?
They simply say it is torture and killing.
And that they are crimes.
I'm risking my life, often even when exchanging prisoners of war and captured the ... This works for me, may at any time refer to the end ... I need to go back.
A.cz: how many executions and torture of prisoners, you know?
... (long pause) ... to torture prisoners during interrogations and Ukrainians separatists resort.
Unfortunately.
And executions?
These take place only on the Donetsk side.
That also the Ukrainian army executes prisoners, I don't have the information.
Even indications that the Ukrainian army guilty of something.
We have an idea about the amount of executions, but the numbers indicate I can't and I don't want to.
A.cz: describe to me the characters and themes of pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
Strive for autonomy, and perhaps even democracy in Donetsk and Luhansk regions-at least so they say.
They don't want to play any more games with the Ukrainian oligarchs.
The separatists have oligarchs full teeth and their implacable opponents-on life and death.
As we say-přejedli them up to the throat.
The same dreams and aspirations, the way people demonstrate on Maydan.
And now a little zaspekuluji: Russia supports separatists and the West, by contrast, the Ukrainian State.
One speculation, I consider it a great and the other on the contrary for a little.
Now this is my sentence but conceals a irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: How do you, for example, appears to be one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists Igor Bezler?
Always when I went, I was front line without a weapon, and I show the soldiers or the militants spread bare hands.
And I always have both sides of the two hundred or three hundred metres away the shot or optical cross hairs.
The faces of the people who headed for me, every time I see a well ... and they can anytime pull the trigger of his weapon.
A paratrooper, an experienced Colonel, with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
It is considered a Russian officer, but his family-mother-lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just as a small province in the great Russian Empire.
In any case, always talks about it and the Ukraine is considered to be a sort of arising from misunderstanding.
Such a State would not exist.
At the same time is his enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: when we are talking about the characters-in a discussion show you your Ukrainian tv premiere Arsenije Jaceňuka called weak, helpless and grown tired of the "leader" who would do best if they quickly left.
For those three hundred metres walk I get always the fear at least five times.
Why I should hide the view that Jaceňuk is very weak, the Prime Minister and that is detrimental to our country?
A.cz: do you share on the war in the Ukraine?
You may know that Ukrainians call Jaceňuka "rabbit".
And the rabbit is in the eyes of the animal from which the Ukrainians would fear or should other respect and authority.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of rabbit.
Maybe it's a good economist, but as Prime Minister does not have the right to cry in the war in Parliament, begging him, play with him, and his intrigues, threaten, that puts function ... He must manage the country, manage it, and in time of war and protect.
When the threat of the country does not have the Prime Minister entitled to family, friends, relax on your maudlin emotions.
He is the first of the Ministers of Ukraine.
And Jaceňuk?
Behaves like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but also weak because it has never been strong... don't fight for Ukraine, it's just constantly complains about everything.
It should therefore go.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.

I'm mad at myself, "Ryan's ashes sprinkled on his head.
"I think I had to give up under the lid, it came to me a little bit," he mused.
Defenzíva Sigmy of Opava much let the exception was Mikulův RAID from 11. minutes, which, however, cover the goalie Reichl.
Then he began to push the men from Haná to chance is but in a block to go home and missiles from afar culture Ratheesh.
Fifteen minutes later we are making, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the game and only threatened us from Opava standard situations.
But his chance Vašíček transformed and so it ended 0-0, "was coach Leoš Kalvodu Folk.
Opava was due to absence through point in the report, where in addition to a pair of injured Petr Vavřík also missed out with the třígólovým scorer Petr Ševčík, who host of Sigmy in Silesia.

Al Pacino twice with Venice.
Otherwise, the film festival is experiencing a crisis of
After the huge enthusiasm of the opening film, Birdman, Director Alejandro González Iňárritu which became ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, other days suggested that interested in 71. Festival in Venice, somewhat waned.
Whatever, therefore, that the number of seats in the largest Hall has increased to fourteen hundred, or, therefore, that after the Birdmanovi was followed by criticism of the recognized, but for the audience less attractive frames like a documentary about genocide in Indonesia, 60. years of silence, and looking at other movies with social themes from the American 99 homes after the Iranian stories, simply remained empty in the cinema seat.
The heroes of the comics
Not even a red carpet in front of the Festival Palace neobléhaly has such a crowd as in the past, and supposedly ceased to be a problem to get a last-minute place in the hotel.
About the crisis talks in Italy more than elsewhere and it is no wonder that has affected even so weighted institutions such as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis reflected a lack of personalities, however, present exclusively in connection with the movies.
While younger fans longed for autogramech of comic book superheroes, Michael and Andrew Garfield Shannona who in 99 homes quite successfully acquitted of dramatic roles, for all generations, without distinction, became the main event of the visit of the legendary actor Al Pacino.
In addition, right here in the glow of two films.

Points for Italians
Indeed, the Italian film this year's leads in Venice very well.
Black soul, which was directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first frame after the Birdmanovi odměněným a long standing applause.
An offshoot of the Calabrian mafia is seen looking at the family relationships between the clans, which are fighting for power and money, and the Director managed to reconcile all the preconditions for a good movie: high-quality screenplay, camera, music and actors.
The Chamber also delivered a psychothriller hungry hearts Saverio Costanzo, who made with Rohrwacherovou in the role of women, Albou, the misguided self-protection nearly kills his own child.
In contrast, French films have seen no warm welcome or a ransom for fame, nor 3 heart, both adhering to the traditional model of a table of films that are based on the popularity of the acting leaders.
But after all, the two really good movies, the Birdman and black soul, are not on the first half of the Festival so little.
And though the Festival images have generally depressed subjects, a new snapshot of Peter Bogdanoviche called She's Funny That Way, witty comedy referred to out of competition in Venice and shot in the style of American comedian 40. years, was able to lift your spirits on more than one day.

Last week placed the victory of proponentům Scottish independence at your fingertips
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger, that this error makes the third time when he nearly placed on billboards all over Scotland, the question of whether they want to be wealthy Scots.
But hearts of Scottish voters you reach by appealing to their wallet, or you won't get their respect when they begin to threaten.
The morality of the New Testament in Scotland is still alive, although few Scots still goes to church even today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to drive the money changers from the temple, than to let them dictate how they should vote.
The boss of Scottish nationalist Alex Salmond knows this, and therefore, in a television discussion repeatedly asked his opponent, unionistického Darling, whether it is willing to respect "the sovereign will of the Scottish people" If the Scottish electorate voted for independence, and start promoting the single currency for the Scotland and England.
This Darling forced to choose between civil society in the Scottish and London financiers, and the grimace he fell into this trap.
Of course, that Darling will not support the mandate of the Scottish electorate.
But the discussion about what Scotland will have a currency, it was already pretty much neutralized.
What really motivates the Scottish selectors is fairness, jobs and the defense of the State health care system, which citizens have for free.
Darling in the matter of currency support London banker and also the impression that it will not protest against privatization of the health sector.
How it said Salmond, "climbed into bed with the conservatives."
It's for every Scottish politics a very dangerous position.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with the conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland not to voters, but to associate "bosses", to the Confederation of British industry.
Beginning to be clear that the Cameronovo refusal to discuss the independence of the Scottish Prime Minister of Salmondem was a serious mistake for the unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee landlord.
The Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron could say that Scotland can be "successful independent countries".
Alistair Darling fails to say anything like that, it feels almost physical pain.
What it tells you is clear: the Scots not to pop off and must accept what is.

Near postávala a group of people loyal to Beijing, who waved the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Commission of the national people's Congress on Sunday agreed to elections in Hong Kong in 2017 was attended by only two of the three candidates.
All candidates must first obtain a letter of support to the Commission, which will probably consist of members loyal to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is for the opposition Democrats, almost impossible to get on the ballots and make a pro-democratic activists to restore the promise and cripple the financial centre of Hong Kong protests movement "of the occupation Headquarters".
In Hong Kong's political reform, the main reason for tension, Chinese leaders are worried that the requirement for democratization extends to other cities.
After Beijing in June published a detailed report outlining Chinese official in Hong Kong, democratic activists organized an unofficial referendum on the election in a special official perimeter and hundreds of thousands of people vpochodovaly into the city's business district and occupied it.
Press Conference, which will be Prime Minister if the Government organizes in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.

Putin calls on Kiev to Eastern Ukraine launched negotiations for "national sovereignty"
According to the description of events the Russian newspapers on Sunday asked Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Ukrainian Government to stop the fighting with separatists in the East of the country and immediately open negotiations about "national sovereignty" the breakaway regions.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin his remark did not intend to imply that the area east of Ukraine under the control of the separatists will become part of Russia, but that their status within the Ukraine should be reevaluated to Russian-speaking area got the power to protect their rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Government of Kiev, to act with the proruskými the rebels as equals, the obvious strategy, according to which the controls since the outbreak of the riots five months ago: Please help the Communist Party to occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to grant the newly announced Novorusku de facto independence, instead of with the West could unite with Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of the State television, Putin denounced the Ukrainian military action to regain the eastern region of Donetsk start and Luhansk regions, which in March and April, after the separatists took Moscow 18. March-Bozen the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine.
The Kremlin and separatists recently occupied territories designated as "Novorusko" or "New Russia", a term which refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian news agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words, according to which "the prisoner of illusions" anyone who believes that the peace talks are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians have launched 26 before the parliamentary election. October campaign, while government troops attacking the civilian population in areas controlled by separatists.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we need to immediately begin meaningful negotiations, and it's not only about the legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and on the Statute of the State sovereignty of the South-Eastern part of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's allusion to the State sovereignty was achieved in the context of wider autonomy, which is already with the leadership of Kiev for several months and that has alleviated concerns about Russian-speaking areas of the threat to the cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that the necessary autonomy may be granted only to the eastern areas of the Ukrainian Government.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but on the internal Ukrainian conflict."
With the Kremlin's spokesman, that should correct the "wrong interpretation" of Putin's remarks, reiterating Russia's leadership to deal with access to the uprising of the separatists in the East, which is different from an open cast of Crimea, where most of the two million population belongs to the ethnic origin of the Russians.
Moscow would have a much bigger problem and Donetsk and Luhansk annex on the East of Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are Russians and polls, which were held prior to the conflict, has shown broad support for staying in Ukraine.
Autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums, the regional Governments of Ukraine gave the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and in effect, to give the Kremlin's de facto control over the territory, which would have joined the Russian Mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula anektovaný five months ago is home to a major Russian naval fleet, the maritime business background and historical coastal resorts.
The area between the Russian Rostovem and the Crimea are also the Centre down the factories and foundries that manufacture important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Porošenko during his inaugural speech of 7. June suggested that Ukrainian lawmakers, after new elections-consider the changes in the Constitution that would have given the disparate regions more control over their finances and linguistic status.
This vision of autonomy, however, is very different from the vision of the Kremlin and separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and instigating violence.
Putin's last call to Kiev to the separatists as equals followed another route for insurgents last week after the Eastern Ukraine penetrated Russian troops and tanks from the previously peaceful area along the sea of Azov.
The separatists fortified, the Russians took control over the Novoazovskem such a force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to occupy the strategic coastal territory up to the Crimea.
This precipitated a huge civilian and military efforts to fortify the Mariupol port with metallurgical factories, about 500 000 inhabitants, which lies between the Novoazovskem and close the entrance gate on the Crimean peninsula.
Porošenko on Saturday, spoke at the meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels and urged action to prevent a further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, which is independent of the past 23 years.
"We're approaching the point from which there is no return," warned Porošenko.
On the territory of Ukraine is now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks.
The EU Summit made no definite action-call for the adoption of other leaders of sanctions against Russia in the case of unspecified Ukrainian crisis escalation.
Colonel Arun Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian national security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday said that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovajsku, after last week's two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1 000 troops penetrated into the Donetsk area, to support the besieged separatists.
The first of 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers, who were captured in Ilovajsku when the Russian invasion, were on Sunday traded for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the Interior of Ukraine, said in a Sunday Lysenko.
