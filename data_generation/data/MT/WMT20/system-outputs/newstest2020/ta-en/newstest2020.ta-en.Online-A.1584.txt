There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.
But it is not merely a discredit that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given revolutionary movements and thereby a new evolution and clear ideology to Indian politics.
We can see that there is a view among the people that revolutionaries are mere fools and are stonehearted people who do not care about human lives.
Bhagat Singh's period shows us their humanity, clear thinking and ability.
After the april 1929 assembly bombing, bhagat singh name spread to India.
He made his public debut in 1930, a little further away from Tamil Nadu.
But within a year of his introduction, his fame has spread rapidly to all corners of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most surprising news in history, and no northernborn leader, including Gandhiji, has not been named in Tamil Nadu in such a short time.
That was because of Thanthai Periyar.
The week after Bhagat Singh's assassination, an editorial in the Republic weekly, entitled Bhagat Singh.
The editorial praised bhagat singhs character and made some comments on the political situation of the day.
Excerpts from the editorial:-
"We would say that bhagat singh really was the right way to fulfill all his principles and that if he had decided he would have to be the same and that if he had not done so, he would not be a man of right.
So now we will call him a true man.
It is our strong opinion that The Bhagat Singh Policy is really what India needs.
Mr. S. S. Had Bhagat Singh not been hanged and died, there would have been no evidence of this victory by so much popularity.
And if Bhagat Singh had not been hanged, Gandhiwould have been more creative.
Bhagat Singh, who was merely a disease dying of his own disease, had to die for his life as a mother who could be useful to show the people of India the path of genuine equality and peace to the people of the world.
We congratulate Bhagat Singh with heartfelt praise for his words and words as a great blessing that no one else can achieve by ordinary.'
Thanthai Periyar has been quoted as saying in an editorial in the Republic.

Another question; We have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the DMK regime.
The a. d. M. Can you point out at least one dam as a dam built in the regimes?
Don't lie.
If the opposition leader has no response to the charge , we are building check dams or planning to construct it at other places, please tell them with evidence.
Leave it, the. M. I am obliged to point out that the untrue saying that the cauvery dam was not being constructed in the Cauvery during the Rule of Ka, may be beautiful if the individual edappadi wants to be a chief minister, it is not a civilised thing or a beauty," DuraiMurugan said.

Bjp takes on caste politics in Tamil Nadu?
If the lotus is not able to blossom anywhere in Tamil Nadu, it is said that the BJP will finally take up caste politics.
When Modi was the prime minister for the first time, he was in a position to leave the lotus in Tamil Nadu.
After this, for the second time, i.e. the ongoing MP elections, he said, "I don't know what you're going to do. Lotus should bloom in Tamil Nadu," Amit Shah said sternly.
But in all the five constituencies, the soil was only able to be soiled.
The entire country is admiring the BJP but there is a wave of opposition in Tamil Nadu.
It is above all triple talaq, Kashmir, Hindi imposition, one nation one language.
All this is combined and it is still in the grim ness.
That is why the BJP leadership is in a state of disgust with the bjp officials in Tamil Nadu and that is why it is said that even the state leadership is not yet appointed.
The BJP is planning to root out the BJP in Tamil Nadu before the coming assembly polls.
The BJP leadership seems to have come to a close decision through the direct field report, intelligence report etc.
Accordingly, there is a feeling among the people of the community that the two Dravidian parties, whether aiadmk or DMK, are not giving adequate importance to the Nadars, Vannipeople and Devendra kula vellalar people.
It is said that the party is upset with the Dravidian parties.
This is the trick that the BJP has taken into its hands.
It has decided to honour the respective community by giving a post to the people of the community, or to give importance.
The appointment of Soundararajan as Thelgana Governor is the same.
Similarly, the BJP government is also said to be giving importance to the top nadars in ISRO.
It is true that if the BJP acts as a respectfor every community, it will bring pride and happiness to the people of the respective communities.
Moreover, there is nothing masticating in any case that will make the BJP a party in this caste politics.
At the same time, it is not known whether these activities of the BJP will be pouring more oil into the fire, as Tamil Nadu is already in the ruins of caste politics.
If caste fire starts to burn, the fact is that even the bud of the lotus, which is now a little bit blooming in Tamil Nadu, will burn in the same fire!
