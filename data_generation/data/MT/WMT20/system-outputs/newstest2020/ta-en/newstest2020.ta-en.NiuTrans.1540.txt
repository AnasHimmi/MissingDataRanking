President Maithripala Sirisena said that the country's emergence of a system of street demonstration for graduates coming out of universities is due to a system of education that has distanced itself from science, technology and research.
Therefore, it is important to introduce and implement the new education systems of the developed countries of the world by making necessary fundamental changes in the national education policy.
This was stated by the President while addressing the second phase of the 'Shilpa Sena' exhibition that started yesterday (25) at the Galella National Stadium in Polonnaruwa.
The second phase of the Shilpa Sena exhibition, which is being organized under the aegis of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research, will be held from yesterday to 29th at the Kallela National Stadium, Polonnaruwa with knowledge, innovation and various entertainment events.
Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the progress of the world is due to innovations in science and technology generated through research.
The President explained the need for experts in this field to pay special attention to the challenges faced by our people due to climate change in an era where scientific, technological and research cooperation is much needed.
The President said that the main challenge in the journey towards development as a nation is that most of the people in the political field, in the scientific, technical and research fields do not think about the country but think only about themselves. He said that the problem is that the country is losing the necessary academics in the services of engineers, doctors and accountants because the educators who receive free education are not only thinking about the country but also leaving the country.
The Shilpa Sena exhibition, which is being organized under the theme of "Strong Hand Prosperous Country", is divided into five categories: entrepreneurship, industry, new products, blue collar and entertainment in the field of technology.
In the field of technology, STEM has been organized to promote advanced scientific, technical and research knowledge on key themes such as education, space technology, life sciences, robotics, nanotechnology, megatonics, new strengths, blue green technology and 55G IOT.

Inaugurating the exhibition, the President visited the exhibition and held a cordial interaction with the Working Group.
Secretary, Ministry of Science, Technology and Research, Chinthaka S. Lokuhettige and other officials were present on the occasion.

When many people complained about it, they did not realize that they were thinking of an alternative or that the solution was in their own hands.
The correct solution is that people will come forward only if I do what I believe.
That's why I and my wife walk 10 kilometres a week to buy vegetables.
After six months of continuous work, it has become a habit.
Now I am very satisfied with myself, "he said.
"Many people said that it is difficult to walk with a lot of vegetables and I recommended them to carry bamboo baskets to fight the menace of plastic.
But when they heard it, they laughed.
So, I and my wife carried bamboo baskets and went to the market.
Only then did I know that it would be very helpful in many ways.
Many young people are not healthy these days.
I think they have to start walking and control their food.
I am deeply convinced that the traditional system can provide the best solutions to the new challenges in the modern world.
If one uses traditional methods, one can stay healthy, "says Ram Singh IAS.

If we take the lifestyle right, we can prevent heart disease from occurring in some way.
In modern medicine, one can foresee who will have a heart attack.
If it is found in the beginning, it can prevent heart attack.
A heart attack can be fatal, but can also be cured quickly.

The Election Commission has reduced the disqualification period of Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh, who was convicted in a corruption case, from six years to one month.
This has removed the hurdle in contesting the Tamang by-election.
Sikkim Legislative Assembly election was held with Lok Sabha elections.
Sikkim's Grandikari Morcha won a landslide victory in this election.
The leader of the party, Premsingh Tamang, took over as the Chief Minister of the state.
However, in 2016, a lower court sentenced Tamang to life imprisonment in a corruption case.
When the Supreme Court confirmed this, he suffered imprisonment.
The controversy erupted when Tamang took office, as a man who suffered a prison sentence in a corruption case could not contest the election for six years.
Tamang is contesting the Sikkim Legislative Assembly by-election.
Tamang, with the support of the BJP, is ruling Sikkim.
In the meantime, Tamang had sent a letter to the Election Commission requesting that he remove the six-year ban on contesting elections, citing various sections of the law.
After considering the letter, the Election Commission has announced that it will reduce the ban period for Tamang to one year and one month.
Thus, Tamang is not barred from contesting the by-election in the Legislative Assembly.
The BJP can now start playing politics in other states, including Tamil Nadu, using the privilege granted to Tamang.
The Election Commission may also issue statements fulfilling the wishes of the BJP in full swing.

There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.
But it is not just a compliment that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given a new evolution and a clear ideology to revolutionary movements and thereby to Indian politics.
We can still see that there is a perception among the people that the revolutionaries are just fools and are uneducated people who don't care about human lives.
The period of Bhagat Singh reminds us of his humanitarianism, clarity of thought and skill.
On April 29, 1929, after the assembly bombing, Bhagat Singh's name became widespread in India.
It was not until the 1930s that he became known to the public.
But within a year of his debut, his fame spread rapidly to every corner of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most surprising news in history that the name of any leader born in the north, including Gandhi, has not spread to Tamil Nadu in such a short span of time.
That's because of Father Periyar.
The week after Bhagat Singh was killed, an editorial appeared in the Republic Weekly entitled Bhagat Singh.
The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's character's interests and made some comments on the political situation of the day.
Some passages from the Athalayang are as follows: -
"In fact, if Bhagat Singh ji is convinced that all his principles are right and the models he has done are the right way to fulfill them, we will say that if he has decided then he will definitely have to follow his footsteps and if he has not done so, he will not be able to say that he is a healthy person.
Now we're going to call him a real man.
It is our strong opinion that India really needs Bhagat Singh's policy.
If Shri Bhagat Singh had not been hanged and survived, there would not have been any evidence that this victory would have been so popular.
And, if Bhagat Singh had not been hanged, Gandhi would still have had a positive impact.
For Bhagat Singh, who had to be sick or sick, why should a mother be able to show the people of India the path of true equality and peace for the people of the world?
We applaud Bhagat Singh for saying that it is a great achievement that no one else can achieve by ordinary means! "
This was stated by Father Periyar in an editorial in the Republic magazine.
In the meantime, a guard named Dennis Turner, who was in custody at the school where the incident took place, arrested the girl who was holding Adam in the school for kicking and kicking the teacher.
In addition, he tied the girl's hand with a plastic tag and took her to the police car, to the Juvenile Assessment Centre, where a photo of the girl holding a nameplate was also taken, just as the criminals were taking it.
Copies of his handwriting have also been taken.
This information was then communicated to the girl's family and handed over to her family.
It is not known if he had taken another child to the police station.
His grandmother Kirkland, who agreed to release the identity of the girl Gaia Rolle, told the media that her daughter, who is suffering from sleep problems called Sleep Apnea, is suffering from the effects of the medication used to treat her.
I was shocked to learn that he had been arrested for this and said that it was difficult for any 6 year old child to understand and explain it.

Since coming to power, the BJP has been preventing the common man from getting access to education as much as possible, reducing the funding for primary education in the 2015 budget, followed by a massive reduction in the funding for education during one budget.
This was followed by continuous flow of big business to set up educational institutions in order to provide more facilities to private educational institutions.
At this stage, the new education policy has put in place a number of rules to ensure that educational institutions are funded by private institutions without giving any importance to public educational institutions.
With this, the central government is trying to push only the privileged from basic education to higher education and take India's rich future back centuries as an illiterate nation.
Ranu's book 'Art of caricature' was released by Kalaimagal magazine editor Keelambur Sankara Subramaniam and received by former IAS officer Karpoora Sundarapandiyan.
The book release function of the late "cartoonist" Ranu, written by S.K. Ramanujan, took place on Sunday at the Russian Cultural Centre in Chennai.
The function was presided over by P Thangappan, Secretary, Indo-Russian Chamber of Commerce.
The first book was released by Kalaimagal magazine editor Keelambur Sankara Subramaniam and received by R Karpoora Sundara Pandian, a former IAS officer and head of the Siddhar Research Centre.
Speaking on the occasion as a special guest, Karpoora Sundarapandiyan said: -
The late cartoonist Ranu Ramanuja was one of the foremost cartoonists.
Ranu has created a large number of students through the Cartoon Research and Education Foundation.
In general, even one celebrated by the world is not celebrated by the family.
On the contrary, it is a matter of pride that even after the demise of the cartoonist Ranu, the family itself has brought out his book.
Despite Ranu's passing away, he said he would have lived through his works and through this book for a long time.
S. K. Ramanujan was India's leading cartoonist.
He used to travel all over the world and train in caricatures.
He was an innovative artist in the making of cartoons.
Ranu was not only a painter but also a cartoonist and an expert in animation.
For the past 30 years, he has carried out a study of the art of caricature in accordance with the Indian environment.
He said that through the students he created, he would live a long life through his writings and cartoons.
R. Boopathy, coordinator of the Ranu Cartoon Research and Education Foundation, expressed his gratitude.
Nallathambi, TV executive C. Pereira and others participated.
The DMK has questioned Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami about the number of check posts built under the AIADMK regime over the past eight years.
In a statement issued by the party's treasurer Thuraimurugan, he criticised the CM for not knowing any details about the public service sector.
In his statement, DMK treasurer Thuraimurugan said that the water that is being opened up in the Cauvery is flowing into the sea in vain due to the apathy of the ADMK government and lack of administrative skills.
Our leader MK Stalin had expressed his concern about the responsibility of the opposition leader of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly that there was no concrete plan for the ADMK government to stop the Cauvery crossing.
Thinking that he would answer the CM, Edappadi Palaniswami asked, "Did the DMK people who are criticising us build a barracks in the Cauvery under their rule?"
"I want to inform him that under the DMK regime, we have built a barricade at Mayanur in the Cauvery.
Can Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami, who is also in charge of the public works department without even knowing the details, speak out of the truth?
The earth's water resources were increased in the area due to the construction of the barracks in Mayanur.
That's why agriculture has flourished.
Therefore, thousands of people from the farming community of that region, who are still benefiting from it, can always be seen thanking the government of the Corporation.
The barracks were built in Mayanur as per the requirement of the period.
At that time, there was no need to build more barracks.
If the need had been there, then the then Chief Minister Kalaignar Ji would have immediately given permission, set aside funds and stepped up the work.
So, Edapadi has nothing to do with criticizing the club government for the welfare of Kaveri.
I ask: How many barracks have you built in the Cauvery during the last eight years of the AIADMK regime?
Another question: During the reign of DMK, we built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu.
Can you point to at least one dam that has been built in the ADMK regime so far?
Don't lie.
If there is a reply to the allegation made by the Leader of the Opposition, please find out with the evidence that we are building barricades or planning to build barricades at these places.
Instead, I am obliged to point out that the DMK regime has not built a barracks in the Cauvery, it may be beautiful if it is rooted in personal weight, it is not civilized or beautiful for the post of chief minister he holds, "said Thuraimurugan.

Extension of time for linking Aadhaar with PAN till 31st December, 2018
The time for linking Aadhaar number with Permanent Income Tax Account Number (PAN) has been extended up to 31st December, 2018.
This is the seventh time that the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the period for linking PAN with Aadhaar.
The Central Government had earlier extended the period from 31st March to 30th September, 2018 for a period of six months.
This period has now been extended for another three months.
The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) provides a 12-digit Aadhaar number to every citizen of India.
The Income Tax Department provides a written and numerical identification number in the number 10 of Permanent Income Tax Account Number (PAN) for the individual and company paying income tax.
The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had notified on 1st July, 2017 that Aadhaar number should be linked to Income Tax Number.
Thereafter, the time for linking Aadhaar with PAN has been extended several times.
Meanwhile, in September last year, the Supreme Court heard a case against the issuance of Aadhaar cards to the citizens and ruled that the Aadhaar scheme would go under the law.
The Supreme Court also ruled that Aadhaar number is mandatory for payment of income tax.
Meanwhile, when filing income tax returns, it is enough to mention Aadhaar number instead of PAN, which was announced in the Union Budget on 5th July last year.

Does the BJP take up caste politics in Tamil Nadu?
Whatever be the case in Tamilnadu, it is said that the BJP will finally take up caste politics if it is not able to keep the lotus blossoming.
When Modi was the Prime Minister for the first time, there was a situation in Tamil Nadu where he had to leave his hand and watch Tamar.
After that, for the second time, during the ongoing MP elections, Amit Shah said, "I don't know what to do and I want Thamarai to bloom in Tamil Nadu."
However, only five of the contested constituencies were able to win the soil.
Even though there is a lot of baggage all over the country, there is a wave of protests in Tamilnadu.
Above all, the issue of triple talaq, Kashmir, imposition of Hindi, one nation, one language.
When all of this is done, it is still visible.
That's why it is said that the BJP leadership is so angry with the Tamilnadu BJP executives that even the state leadership is still unable to be appointed.
Even though this is on the one hand, the BJP is planning to root out the BJP in Tamil Nadu in the upcoming assembly elections.
The BJP leadership seems to have come to a close with a direct field report, intelligence report and so on.
Accordingly, there is a feeling among the people of the respective communities that the two Dravidian parties do not give enough importance to the people of Nadar, Vanniar and Devendra Kula Vellalar.
It is said that the Dravidian parties are in a state of regret.
This is the formula that has been adopted by the BJP as a tactic.
They have decided to honour their respective communities by giving them a position of pride or importance.
The appointment of Tamil Nadu Soundarajan as Governor of Telangana is one such thing.
Similarly, it is said that the BJP government is also giving importance to the top-ranking Nadars of ISRO.
It is true that if the BJP acts in such a manner that it honors every race then it will bring pride and happiness to the people of the respective communities.
Moreover, there is nothing that doesn't matter, this caste will only make a mockery of the BJP in politics.
At the same time, when Tamil Nadu is already embroiled in caste politics, it is not known whether these activities of the BJP will become like pouring more oil into the burning fire.
It is true that if the caste fire starts to burn, even the bald of Tamar, who is now suffering a little loss in Tamilnadu, will be burnt in the same fire!
