President Maithripala Sirisena said that the way in which graduates from universities demonstrate on the streets asking for jobs is due to an educational system that excludes science, technology and research fields.
Therefore, the President said that it is very important to take fundamental changes in national education policies and introduce and implement new education systems of developed countries in the world.
The President said this while addressing the second leg of the 'Shilpa Sena' exhibition at Polonnaruwa Kallella National Stadium early yesterday morning.

Noting that the majority of people in politics and science, technology and research are not thinking about the country and thinking about themselves is a major challenge in the journey towards development as a country, the President said that the country is losing the necessary academics in engineering, doctors and accountancy services because academics who receive free education left the country thinking about themselves and not the country.

On the 5th of last year, more than 60 members of the Hindu Front entered and attacked the Pinnaladai Institute in Angeripalayam Road, Tiruppur.
As a result, the workers were attacked and company belongings were damaged.
Police have done some research on this.
While there has been strong condemnation from industry, various political parties, movements and the general public about the incident, a protest has been announced on behalf of the secular Progressive Alliance parties of Tiruppur on 9th.
The complaint was filed with the District Collector and the Municipal Police Commissioner of Tiruppur when they refused permission.
The demonstration was announced again on September 17 on behalf of the Secular Progressive Alliance (SPA) at a subsequent consultation.
Because the police refused permission for the demonstration, the protest started at 11am on 17th at Tiruppur Municipal Corporation 'condemning the violent attitude of the Hindu Front and urging police to take swift action'.
The protest was led by K. Selvaraj, the DMK secretary for the Northern District of Tiruppur.
CPI (M) State Council member K Kamaraj, Tiruppur District CPI (M) Secretary C. Muthukannan, Tiruppur District CPI Secretary M. Ravi, Congress Party Ramasamy and Madhimuka Sampath, among others, participated in the demonstration.
In the midst of the demonstration, police narrowly denied permission to demonstrate.
The Secular Progressive Alliance Party (SPA) said that on the 5th of last year in Tiruppur, a group called the Hindu Front had attacked the backroom company and rioted.
We have formally asked for permission to conduct a democratic demonstration against this incident, the police have not given permission, we have filed a complaint with the government and the police commissioner regarding this and thereafter the police have refused permission for the demonstration to take place in a democratic manner and the demonstration is currently going on in violation of the ban.
Moreover, the police have arrested only a few people in the incident where the backroom company was attacked.
They said the police should take expeditious measures to arrest the Hindu prominent rowdies still involved in the incident.
More than 500 people, particularly women, took part in the demonstration in large numbers and voiced opposition to the violence, prompting the police to retreat without arresting the demonstrators.
The demonstration was met with loud chants of protest against the attack by the Hindu Front in Tiruppur and the religious-violence being caused by the Hindu Front in various forms.
If the democratically controlled and secular Progressive Alliance demonstrated an awareness against violence among the people of Tiruppur, it would be no surprise!

Speaking about the effort, Ram Singh said, "The difficulties of buying more vegetables, the difficulties of traffic jams, environmental pollution and other activities have resulted in people being frustrated.
When many people had complained about it, they did not seem to realize that they were considering an alternative but that they had a solution.
The right solution is that if I do what I believe in, the people will come forward to follow.
So my wife and I have been walking 10 km a week and buying vegetables.
Having been going for six months now, it has become a habit.
Right now, I am mentally satisfied, "he said.
"A lot of people said that it is difficult to carry a lot of vegetables and I recommended them to carry a bamboo basket to fight the threat of plastic.
But they listened and laughed.
So my wife and I went to the market carrying a bamboo basket.
Only then did I know that it would be very helpful in many ways.
Many young people are not in healthy health these days.
I think they should start walking and control their food.
I believe deeply that traditional methods can provide the best solutions to the new challenges of the modernised world.
One can remain fully healthy if one employs traditional methods, says Ram Singh with enthusiasm at IAS.

If we move ahead with lifestyle, we can prevent cardiovascular disease somewhat.
In existing modern medicine, it is possible to predict who will get a heart attack.
If it is found in the beginning, it may prevent a heart attack.
Even if a heart attack occurs, it can be cured quickly.

The Election Commission has reduced the disqualification period for Sikkim Chief Minister Premsingh, who was convicted in a corruption case, from six years to one month.
This has removed the deadlock in contesting the Tamang by-election.
Sikkim Legislative Assembly elections were held with Lok Sabha elections.
Sikkim Krantikari Morcha won the election immediately.
The president of the party, Prem Singh Tamang, took over as Chief Minister.
But in a corruption case, Tamang was sentenced to jail in 2016 by a lower court.
The Supreme Court also confirmed this and he faced imprisonment.
Controversy erupted when Tamang took office because a person serving a prison sentence in a corruption case could not contest the election for six years.
Tamang is contesting the Legislative Assembly by-election in Sikkim.
With the support of the BJP, Tamang governs in Sikkim.
In the meantime, Tamang had sent a letter to the Electoral Commission seeking the removal of a 6-year ban on him contesting the elections, citing various provisions of the law.
In considering the letter, the Electoral Commission announced that it would reduce the ban period for Tamang to one month.
Thus, Tamang is not barred from contesting the Legislative Assembly by-election.
The BJP can now start playing its politics in other states including Tamil Nadu using the privilege given to Tamang.
The Election Commission and the statements executing BJP's wishes may be released in full swing.

There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.
But it is not just a compliment that Bhagat Singh and his friends have given a new evolution and a clear ideology to the revolutionary movements and thereby Indian politics.
We can still see today that there is a perception among the people that the revolutionaries are just fools and that they are stonewallers who don't care about human life.
The Bhagat Singh era conveys to us their humanity and clear thinking and capability.
After the bombing of the Legislative Council in April 1929, Bhagat Singh's name became widespread in India.
It was not until the 1930s that it became known to the general population.
But within a year of his debut, his popularity had spread rapidly across all corners of Tamilnadu.
This is the most surprising news in history and the name of any North Indian-born leader, including Gandhi, has not spread in such a short time in Tamil Nadu.
The reason for this is because of their father.
Only the week after Bhagat Singh was killed, an editorial appeared in Republic Weekly entitled Bhagat Singh.
The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's character interests and offered some ideas about the political situation of the day.
Excerpts from the editorial include: -
"In fact, Bhagat Singh ji had made sure that his whole ideology was correct and the models he had behaved in order to accomplish it were the right way and if he had decided not to, we would definitely say that he should have behaved the way he had behaved and if that had not happened then he would not have been able to say that he was a wise person.
Therefore, we must now say that he is a true person.
Our strongest opinion is that India really needs the Bhagat Singh ideology.
If Shri Bhagat Singh had not been executed and died, there would have been no evidence that this victory would have been caused by such popularity.
Let us say that if Bhagat Singh had not been executed, Gandhi would still have been inspired.
For Bhagat Singh, who must have suffered from self-inflicted illness and died of ashes, why did a useful mother lose her life to show the true path of equality and peace to the people of the world.
We heartily congratulate Bhagat Singh on being a great accomplishment that no one else can achieve. "
Father Periyar mentioned in a Republic Journal editorial.
In the meantime, a guard named Dennis Turner, who was in police custody at the school where the incident took place, has arrested the girl who was holding an adam at the school for the reason she kicked the teacher.
In it, he plastic tagged the girl's hand and took her in a police car to the Juvenile Assessment Center, where a photograph of the girl standing bearing a plaque was taken similar to that of the offenders.
His fingerprints have also been taken.
This information has since been reported to the girl's family and handed over to her family.
It is not known whether he took another child to the police station.
His grandmother Kirkland agreed to reveal the identity of the little girl Kaya Roll and in an interview with the media, my granddaughter, who is suffering from sleep problems called 'Sleep Apnea' because of the drugs she consumes, has been addicted to religious behaviour.
I am very shocked that he has been arrested for that and he has said that it is difficult for any 6 year old child to understand and explain it.

The Status Report of the World Nuclear Energy Sector was released on 24th January.
The chairman of the committee that produced the report was Michael Scheider.
According to the survey, the nuclear energy sector has declined from 17.46 percent of the world's energy demand in 1996 to 10.15 percent in 2018.
This decline suggests that the world's attention is moving beyond nuclear power towards renewable and long-term viable energy.
Leaving nuclear power behind, renewable energies such as solar power, wind power and hydro power are increasing globally.
Each year, various agencies come together to report on the status of the global nuclear energy sector.
According to a report released this year, the entire world appears to be in decline in the nuclear energy sector.
The report also notes that India's nuclear energy sector is in critical condition.
Bilgates honoured Prime Minister Modi with the Global Goalkeeper Award for outstanding implementation of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
In India, the Union Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi is announcing and implementing the Swachh Bharat Mission.
The scheme was launched on 2-10-2014, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2014.
The project is aimed at construction of household toilets, construction of public toilets and solid waste management etc.
More than 10 crore toilets have been constructed across the country under this scheme.
Rural health coverage has been brought in 98 percent of the villages.
It was announced that on behalf of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation of the United States, Modi will be awarded the World Goalkeeper of the Year Award, an International Achievement Award.
In this context, Prime Minister Modi, who is on a tour of the United States, was awarded the Global Goalkeeper Award today.
At an event held on the sidelines of the UN Security Council meeting in New York today, the world's richest man, Bill Gates, presented the award to Modi.
The award-winning Prime Minister Modi said that Mahatma Gandhi's dream of cleanliness has now been fulfilled.
The Prime Minister said that in addition to completing the Swachh Bharat Mission, he will present the award to crores of Indians who have made it a part of their daily lives.
Modi noted that the World Health Organization has said that three lakh people have been saved from various diseases due to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

The Ministry of Education has issued a media statement regarding Teachers Presidents Holiday Leave.
In a statement, the Ministry of Education said that suggestions and recommendations have been initiated to resolve pay discrepancies in the service of teachers and principals.
The Ministry of Education has said that the absence of teachers and principals on sick leave based on their pay dispute is a gross injustice to the government as it prepares to implement the Government Services Pay Conflict (GSPC) recommendation from 1st January next year to increase the salaries of all government employees, including teachers and principals.
It is the right of employees to engage in trade union activities.
Although it has not been challenged, the Ministry said that cheating on the opportunistic behaviour of the trade unions used as a strategy to deceive members is not conducive to the intelligent and honourable profession such as teaching principals, citing the success achieved due to their actions despite being aware of the possible pay rises.
Education Minister Akhilaviraj Kariyavasam told parliament last July that the salaries of teachers and principals had been massively increased in 2015 and this amount had been increased by 106 per cent. Similarly the increase in salaries was a step taken by any government.
The Minister informed the Parliament on 7th June that the Ministry of Education had submitted suggestions and recommendations regarding the pay dispute between the teachers and the Principals to the appointed Ranukke Committee on the general pay dispute within the Government Service.
The allowance for principals has been increased from 650 rupees to 6,500 rupees.
The promotion work that had been delayed since the beginning of 2015 has now been properly carried out.
A system has been prepared and put in place for acceptance of pension.
Around 6,000 people were inducted into the service after recovering the Presidential Service from politics and conducting a competitive examination to address shortcomings of Presidential standards in the service.
Teachers and Principals were given the opportunity to train abroad, 25,000 people were enrolled in the teaching service and the first steps were completed in the last four and a half years, i.e. in a short period of time.
These will be promoted as the objective of human resource development in the field of education, the Ministry of Education added in a press release today.

Vikramlander collided heavily on the lunar surface and NASA released the photo evidence.
NASA's LROC Orbiter has captured and sent a picture of the Vikram Lander of the 28 Lunar Yaan-2 spacecraft that crashed heavily into the South Pole area of the moon.
The Vikram Lander of the Chandra Yaan-2 mission sent by ISRO touched down on the South Pole of the Moon on 7th July.
However, at the last moment the communication was disconnected.
As the Vikram lander slowly landed on the lunar surface, it was thought that it was damaged and communication could have been cut off.
On this occasion, NASA's LROC Orbiter passed through the South Pole area of the Moon on 17th.
The Vikram Lane Dar landed Simbe Lius N and Manciness C, sending a state-of-the-art snapshot of the plain between the two ridges.
After researching these films, the Vikram lander crashed heavily on the ground and landed safely.
Therefore, it is only a short distance from where the landing should have taken place.
Speaking on the subject, John Keller, Deputy Director of NASA's AROC Program, said, "The LROC Orbiter passed through the South Pole of the Moon on the 17th.
It has sent us pictures taken in the evening when darkness is over.
On examining it, it is learnt that the Vikram lander crashed heavily on the ground.
However, Vikram could not find the exact location where the lander landed.
LROC R Bitter will cross the South Pole again on 14th of next month.
Since the light will be good then, there is a lot of opportunity to shoot Vikram Lander, "he said.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the United Nations General Assembly on behalf of India.
He lashed out against terrorism.
In his address, he reminded me of the land where people like India, Buddha, Vivekananda and Ganyan Park lived.
Speaking on the occasion, Modi said, Our country has delivered a message of peace to the world, not war.
And that is why we have always raised our voice against terrorism.
We warn the world not to fall into the grip of the monster of terrorism.

It means we own everything.
Everybody is our relative.
This is the uniqueness of India.
We do not see terrorism as just a challenge for India.
We see it as an act against the whole world and against humanity.
Therefore, the entire world must rally against terrorism.
125 years ago, the great spiritual guru Swami Vivekananda had given this message to the world during the World Conference of Religions in Chicago.

And there are no differences of opinion.
Today, on behalf of the world's largest democracy, I say the same.
Only 'harmony and peace' is our message to the world. "

AIADI Council has decided to increase fees by 10 times across all Indian Institutes of Technology.
Ayidi Institute of Technology (AITI) is playing an important role in the development of talented students across India.
Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal chaired a meeting of AIDI Council of Directors of 23 AIDI Institutes under Department of Human Resource Development (DHRD), Government of India on 28.9.2019.
The decision taken at that meeting has shocked the students and the general public.
The decision has been taken to increase tuition fees by 10 times at AIDI institutions.
Tuition is being collected in all Aids in India from Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000 for Semester.
At this stage, the fee has been increased to Rs. 2 lakh per annum.
9,280 students are eligible for scholarship out of 12 Ayi Ram students in the first year of academic year 2019-2020 and it has also been decided to end the monthly scholarship of 12,400 rupees given to MT students.
The Central Government will reduce the funds provided by AIDS to Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Kharagpur, Kanpur, Rurgi and Guwahati.
The Central Government has increased the fee to collect the funds from the students in order to meet the reduction in funds.
Moreover, the Ministry is advised that the respective companies have been instructed to carry out development work keeping the proceeds from the construction work that can be done by the respective technical institutions, to borrow money in the bank and to receive payments from corporate entities.
Since coming to power the BJP has been preventing education from reaching the common man as much as possible, reducing the funding for primary education in the 2015 budget, followed by drastically reducing the funding for education during each budget.
Subsequently, employers continued to approve the establishment of educational institutions to provide more facilities to private educational institutions.
In this context, the new education policy has imposed a number of provisions requiring educational institutions to operate in the finances of private institutions without giving any significance to government educational institutions.
This has enabled the Central Government to push the well-off from basic education to higher education and take India's prosperous future back centuries as an illiterate country.

In general, even someone who is celebrated by the world is not celebrated by the family.
Cartoonist Ranu, on the other hand, is credited with bringing out the book he has written since his death and the family themselves.
Even if Ranu passed away, he would have lived through his work and through this book for a long time.
S.K. Ramanujam was a prominent Indian cartoonist when he spoke to Sankara Subramaniam in Keelampur.
He travelled around the world, offering satirical training.
He became an innovative artist in the making of cartoons.
Not only was Ranu an expert in painting, he was also an expert in cartoonist and animation.
For the past 30 years, he has conducted a cartoon art study in keeping with the Indian environment.
He said he would live through his students and through his writings and cartoons for a long time.
R. Boopathy, Co-ordinator of the Ranu Cartoon Research and Education Foundation, thanked the gathering.
Nallathambi, TV executive C Pereira and others participated.
The DMK has asked Chief Minister Edappadi Palanisamy how many barricades have been built during the last 8 years of AIADMK rule.
In a statement, the party's treasurer Duraimurugan criticised the Chief Minister for not knowing any details about the public works sector.
DMK treasurer Duraimurugan said in a statement that the water being opened in Cauvery is being mixed in waste due to the indifference of the ADMK government and lack of administrative competence.
Our chairman MK Stalin had expressed his concern that the ADMK government had no concrete plans to store it on the way through Cauvery and that it was the opposition leader of the Tamilnadu Assembly.
Thinking of replying to the Chief Minister, Edappadi Palanisamy said, "Did the DMK who blame us, have they built at least a barricade in Cauvery under their rule?"
"I would like to inform him that under the DMK regime, we have built a barricade at Mayanur in Cauvery under the Kazhagam regime.
Without even knowing the details, can the Chief Minister Edappadi Palanisamy, who has put the public services department in charge, speak out of the truth?
With that barrier built in Mayanur, the water resources of the earth increased in that area.
That's why farming flourished.
Therefore, thousands of farmers of that region who still benefit today can always be seen thanking the Kazhagam government.
During that period, the barricade was built in Mayanur by the Kazhagam government.
At that time, there was no need to build more barricades.
If necessary, the then Chief Minister Kalaignar ji would have given permission immediately, allocated funds and stepped up the work.
Therefore, in maintaining the well-being of Cauvery, there is nothing close to Edapadi blaming the Kazhagam government.
I ask, how many barricades have you built in Cauvery in the last eight years of the ADMK government?
Another question: We have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the DMK era.
Can you pinpoint a single dam as the dam built in the ADMK regimes that has happened so far?
Don't lie.
If there is a response to the allegation made by the leader of the opposition, please tell us with the evidence that we are building or planning to build barricades in these places if there is a response.
Thereafter, I am obliged to point out that under the DMK regime, talking outside the truth that the barricade itself has not been built in Cauvery, it may be beautiful if you want personal editing, it is not a civilised act or beautiful act for the Chief Minister position he holds, "Duraimurugan said.

This is the seventh time that the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the time for Pan-Aadhaar connectivity.
The Union Government had earlier extended this period from 31st March to 30th September, 2018 for six months.
This extension has now been extended for another three months.

Meanwhile, it was announced in the Central General Budget on 5th July that if Aadhaar number is mentioned instead of PAN number when filing income tax returns, it is sufficient.
DMK President MK Stalin visited the Keeladi excavation sites where Vaigai Karai has showcased Tamil culture in person today.
The life of Sangam literature tells the story of a Tamil man who lived his life in blood and flesh; the excavation results revealed that it was not fiction.
The city civilization on the banks of the River Ganga in the north began in the 6th century BC.
But the Tamils lived peak city life in the 6th century BC on the banks of the River Vaigai to the south, and underground excavation evidence has scientifically demonstrated that Tamils lived a rich life as the best of literate knowledge.
The results of the excavation have created a rewriting of the history of the Indian subcontinent.
A large number of people visit the Keeladi excavation site which is a matter of pride for every Tamil person.
Recently, Seeman Keeladi, the chief coordinator of the Tamil Party, visited the excavation site.
He was followed today by DMK President MK Stalin, who visited the archaeological sites.
He was accompanied by several prominent executives of CBM MP Su Venkatesan and DMK.
In this regard, Stalin has uploaded a video of himself on his Twitter page titled "Visiting the Underground that made the world aware of Tamil civilization more than 2600 years ago."
Trump requested an investigation from the President of Ukraine!
The White House has confirmed that it is true that Donald Trump telephoned the Ukrainian President to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination.
A Democratic disqualification resolution has been proposed against Trump in the House of Representatives, calling it a misdemeanor attempt to pressure others to investigate the U.S. leader.
In this regard, six committees have been constituted under the direction of Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy and an inquiry has been launched into the President's conduct.
Trump has telephoned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25, so please investigate, "Trump said at the time.
The White House yesterday officially released what the Presidents of both countries have said.
Therefore, it is acknowledged that this conversation is true.
Speaking to reporters outside the United Nations meeting at the same time, Donald Trump said the request was made in a friendly manner.
He said no pressure had been applied to the Ukrainian President.
One thing to note, however, is that the US government abruptly suspended nearly $400 million worth of financial aid to Ukraine.
Then a few months later, the funds were allocated.
The Democrats are tying the knot with this idea that Trump spoke to the President.
So the incident is starting to stir up a storm in American politics.

Does BJP take caste politics into its own hands in Tamilnadu?
Somehow in Tamilnadu, caste politics is supposed to be taken into the hands of the BJP if it is not possible to hammer and lotus flowers anywhere.
When Modi was the Prime Minister for the first time, there was a situation in Tamil Nadu where he had to watch Lotus hand in hand.
After this, for the second time, only during the MP elections, Amitsha said with conviction, "You don't know what to do. You have to blossom in Tamilnadu."
However, only five of the contested constituencies could attract soil.
Even though the whole country is cheering the BJP, there is a wave of protests in Tamilnadu.
This is above all the issues of Triple Talaq, Kashmir, Hindi imposition, one nation is one language.
Since everything has been combined, it is still visible in smoothness.
That is why the BJP leadership is so tight-lipped on the BJP executives in Tamil Nadu that even the state leadership cannot be appointed yet.
Even though this is on one hand, the BJP is planning to root the BJP in Tamilnadu somehow within the upcoming assembly elections.
It is understood that the BJP leadership has come to a virtual conclusion through direct field reports, intelligence reports etc.
Accordingly, whether AIADMK or DMK, there are two Dravidian parties that do not give enough importance to the people of Nadar, to the people of Vanniyar community and to the people of Devendra Kula farmer community.
It is said that the Dravidian parties are unhappy with this.
It is this witchcraft that the BJP has started trickling into action.
The Prime Minister said that in order to make the respective communities proud or important, he had decided to honour them with a post.
Tamilisai Soundarajan's appointment as the governor of Telangana is a similar one.
Similarly, it is said that the BJP government is giving importance to the high-ranking Nadars in ISRO.
It is true that if the BJP acts in such a manner to honour every race, it will bring pride and happiness to the people of the respective communities.
Moreover, something that is not respectful of any subject will only benefit the BJP in this caste politics.
At the same time, when Tamil Nadu is already in the midst of caste politics, it is not known whether these activities of BJP will become like pouring more oil into the burning fires.
If such a caste fire starts to burn, it is true that even the total of the lotus that is now blossoming in Tamilnadu will burn into the same fire.

With this, the world has been given the message that Kashmir is India's internal affair.
