There are revolutionary movements before and after Basu.

But within a single year, his reputation spread rapidly in all corners of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most surprising news in history and the name of any leader born in the North, including Gandhi, has not spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short time.
This is because of Father Periyar.
An editorial was published entitled Passing in the Republic weekly issue of Passing.
The editorial praised many of Passing's character interests and presented some views on the political situation of the day.
Some parts of the area are:
' In fact, we will say that if he has decided that he is the right religion to complete his policies and to fulfil it, he will certainly have to walk on and say that if he had not happened, he would not have been able to say that he would have been a man of Yoga.
Now we will tell him that he is a true man.
Our strong opinion is that India really needs to have a Passing Policy.
If Mr. Passing had not been executed and survived, this victory would not have been a source of such popularity.
And if we had not executed Basu, we would have said that there would still have been creativity and creativity.
It was more than his life to show the true equality and peace to the people of India.
When we say that there is no one else who can achieve it, we congratulate Bhathshak for his heart, mouth and hand! "
In an editorial, Father Periyar said.
In this context, the guard, tennis Turner, who was in custody at the school where the incident took place, has arrested the teenager for the reason why he had given up the teacher.

His fingerprints have also been taken.
He was then informed by the family of the little girl and handed over to his family.
It is not known if he took another child to the police station.
His grandmother, Giorland, who agreed to release the identity of little Kaya Roll, told the media that my granddaughter, who is suffering from the sleep problem of ' Slep Apenea, ' is in the cases due to the effects of eating drugs for it.
I was very shocked when he said he had been arrested for this, and it was difficult for any 6-year-old child to understand and explain this.

It is the right of employees to engage in trade union activities.
Even though it has not been challenged, the ministry has said that it is not an acceptable act for a wise honour industry such as teacher presidents, who have been used as a source of disappointment for members, even after they are aware of the increase in wages that can be put in place.

Ramanjam, the late Carbist Ranu, was the best of the cartoon painters.
Ranu Caron has created a large number of students through research and education trust.
In general, even someone who is celebrated by the world is not celebrated by the family.
On the other hand, it is a matter of pride that the family and family have come out of his book even after Carbist Ranu and late.
Even if Ranu disappeared, he said, he would live for a long time through his works and through this book.
When he spoke to S K Ramanjam, he was the leading member of India.
He travelled all over the world and provided Kailu exercises.
He was a innovative artist in the creation of Kallipta.
Ranu was an expert not only in painting, but also in the field of Carlisle and Asan.

The Chief Minister, Edpudi Palanisami, has questioned how many hurdles have been built in the AIADMK regime over the past 8 years.
In a statement issued by the party's treasurer Duramirugan, he criticised the Chief Minister for not knowing any details about the public sector.
In his statement, director Duramirugan said that the water that is being opened in Kawai is in vain due to the lack of interest of the D.C. government-the lack of administrative talent.
On the way across Kawai, our leader, V. Stalin, expressed concern at the responsibility of the opposition leader of the Tamil Legislative Assembly, saying that there was no plan for it to be stored.
In response to the Chief Minister, Edpedi Palanchami said, " Is it not a barrier built in their kingdom, in Kawai? "
" I want to tell him that we have built a bar in the club regime at Kawai Mayanur in the D.C. regime.
Will the Chief Minister Edpedi Palanchami, who is in charge of the public sector and in his responsibility, speak against the truth?
Due to that block built in Mayanpur, the Earth's water resources grew in the area.
So the farm grew.
So, today, thousands of people of agriculture will always be happy to thank the club government.
At that time, it was built by the government of Mayanur.
At that time, there was no need for further sanctions.
If there had been any need, then the artist, who was then chief minister, would have given permission, funded and stepped up the bureau.
Therefore, there is nothing close to Edpudi to blame the club government in the well-being of Kavi.
I ask: How many hurdles have you built in Kawai in the last eight years?
The other question is: we have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu.
Can you point to a single dam as a dam built in these regimes?
It is not a lie.
If the leader of the opposition has responded to their accusation, know with evidence that we are building or planning to build a block in other places.
Even more than that, I am obliged to point out that it is not a matter of civilization, but of beauty, if you ask for personal weight, for the post of Chief Minister of India, it is not a civilization, it is not a beauty, ' Duramirugan said.
