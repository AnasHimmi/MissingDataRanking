There are revolution movements in front and after Bhagat Singh.
However, Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given a new effect and clear ideology to Indian politics through it.
Even today we can see that there is a opinion among the revolutionary people, and a stone that does not care about human lives.
Bhagat Singh period makes us realize their humanity, clear thinking and ability.
After the assembly bombing program, Bhagat Singh's name was spread in India.
In Tamil Nadu, he was introduced to the public in 1930 only.
But in one year his fame spread very fast in all the corner of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most amazing news in history, including Gandhi, the name of any leader born in north, has not spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short period.
The reason for that is father periyar.
After Bhagat Singh was killed, a editorial was named as Bhagat Singh in the Republic Weekly Magazine.
The editorial of Bhagat Singh's character was appreciated and made some opinions about the political situation.
Some parts from the headlines :-
" if he really bhagat singh is sure that all his principles are right, and he has decided that the right religion is the right religion to fulfill it, then he must have to walk as he has done. We will say that if he had not happened, he would not be able to say that he is a man
So now we call him a true man.
It is our strong opinion that Bhagat Singh policy is really necessary for India.
Mr. If Bhagat Singh had not been hanged and opened his life, this victory would not have been evidence of this victory.
And If Bhagat Singh was not lifted, then we would say that gandhi would have been more work.
Why Bhagat Singh, who had to die with disease, Why Bhagat Singh had to show the people of India to show true equality and peace to the people of the world.
We appreciate Bhagat Singh's heart, who said that no one else can achieve by normal!"
Father periyar has mentioned in that Republic Magazine.
