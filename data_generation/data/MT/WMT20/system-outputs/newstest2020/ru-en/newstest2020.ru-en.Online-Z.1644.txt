Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok censored videos that mention Tianmen Square, Tibet independence, or Falun Gong religious group, tells The Guardian.
The documents found in the publication, it is told that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance), with the application promotes China's foreign policy goals.
The main part of China's policy violations fall under "incitement to hate".
In every case, TikTok puts unacceptable publications in a context that fits the general rules so that social network does not look censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general ban of "criticism or attacks on politics and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc. d"..
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tianananmen or genocide in Cambodia falls under "distortion of the history of China or other countries".
The document also contains a list of prohibited names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen", including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-Ir, Kim Ir Sen and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, American presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese premier Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Kyn Hee, Indonesia President Joko Vidodo and Indian premiere Narendra Modi, indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document said.
Publications from the first category are deleted by social networks administrators and may result in blocking the user.
Not too strict violations apply to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are obsolete and no longer apply: "Now we are using a localized approach to moderation, and also attract independent local specialists".
Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on the publication, co-founder of the "Producer Center" Rustem Bogdanov tells.
"Producer Center" is one Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of the bloggers "Producer Center" harmonizes with social network representatives, but custom materials can be posted without agreement, Bogdanov says.
The question is it possible to speak about politics or Putin in TikTok, Bogdanov answers affirmatively and says he has seen such publications.
Bogdanov agrees with Bogdanov by the founder of the agency Our Digital Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for TikTok users lists in the user agreement: you can't post shocking content that discriminate statements and so on".
But under these rules you can summarize any content that moderators do not like, Zaripov notes.
Zaripov agency is another Russian partner TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 % of whom are under 18 years old.
According to a user agreement, only persons over 13 years old can use TikTok.
Social media administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: the neuronetwork analyzes faces and determines how many years a person looks like, Bogdanov tells.
If the neuronetwork decides that the user is younger, his account can delete, he adds.
According to RBC, September 2019 ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.

In Chile they started building a telescope worth 1 billion euros
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, this week the construction of the dome of the building, where the E-ELT telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope - "European super large telescope") has been officially started so far the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project.
Its total cost is estimated to exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on making equipment and building an observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be collected from 798 hexagonal segments of 1,4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflecting surfaces in diameter of 4,2 and 3,75 meters will help E-ELT get the first detailed photos of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and to look for Earth's twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A *, supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has just begun, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing for three years - since the first plans for the construction of E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total value amounted to about 400 million euros, was received by the German SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
