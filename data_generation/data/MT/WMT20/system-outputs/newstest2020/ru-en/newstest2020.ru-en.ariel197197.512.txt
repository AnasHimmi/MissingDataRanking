I was subjected to a preventive measure in the form of restriction of liberty, which consists in the fact that I cannot attend public mass events and cannot communicate with the organizers of the protest on April 7.
'I've been wearing an electronic bracelet and a base all this time.
So they tracked my location.
I note that I was not restricted in my movements.
Recently I arrived from Moscow, where I was training, "Andrei Borovikov said.

There are more meetings ahead - we need to prepare for them and correct the situation.
How?
If we had known, we probably would have corrected it.
But first of all, it seems to me, we need to add in such component as single combats.
I think we have a problem with that.

China strongly opposes US adoption of Taipei bill
China strongly opposes the US adoption of the so-called "Taipei Bill," which seriously violates the one-China principle and the principles of the three Sino-American joint communiqu√©s.
This was stated on Friday by spokesman for the Office of the State Council for Taiwan Affairs Ma Xiaoguang.
The approval of the bill by the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee is also a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations and a gross interference in China's internal affairs, Ma Xiaoguang said.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and related issues are part of China's internal affairs.
"We call on the US side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue in order to avoid further damage to Sino-US relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," he said.
China must and will be reunified.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or any force, Ma Xiaoguang emphasized.
TikTok hides objectionable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under 18 years of age
Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the banned Falun Gong religious group, The Guardian reports.
Documents obtained by the publication reveal that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) uses the app to promote China's foreign policy objectives abroad.
Most of China's policy violations fall under "hate speech."
In each case, TikTok places objectionable publications in a context appropriate to the general rules, so that the social network's actions do not appear to be censorship.
For example, the prohibition against criticizing China's socialist system falls under the general prohibition of "criticizing or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc."
The ban on mentioning the Tiananmen Square incidents or the Cambodian genocide falls under the "distortion of the history of China or other countries."
The document also contains a list of banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen," including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the document said.
The banned material falls into two categories, the document says.
Publications from the first category are removed by social media administrators and may result in the blocking of the user.
Not too severe violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applied: "We are now using a localized approach to moderation, as well as engaging independent local experts."
Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on publications, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Production Center.
Producing Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Production Center" is coordinated with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without coordination, Bogdanov reports.
When asked if TikTok can speak out about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says he has seen such publications.
Roman Zaripov, founder of Our Digital agency, agrees with Bogdanov: "TikTok enumerates the basic rules for users in the user agreement: you cannot post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on."
But under these rules, you can bring any content that moderators do not like, notes Zaripov.
Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
According to the user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
Social network administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the neural network decides that a user is younger, their account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork co-working.

Russians warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters who substitute the bank's phone number has increased.
Kommersant reports this with reference to data from the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator handed over to telecom operators information about more than 2,500 numbers from which customers of various financial institutions were calling.
In 189 cases, operators found a number change.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases restrictions were imposed on the use of financial services.
Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the Central Bank, Artem Sychev, said that a wide range of Russian banks faced the number change.
He explained that operators do not always respond to warnings from the Central Bank about fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such an obligation in the law "On Communications."
Otkritie Bank, Rosbank and Alfa-Bank confirmed information about an increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a change of number.
According to the press service of Beeline, part of the information about fraudulent calls, which was transmitted by the Central Bank, was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
To block them would disrupt the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudsters "numbers, to which the telecom operator will turn at each call to check the number.
He explained that the creation of such a framework would require amendments to the legislation.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership in the alliance on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The Secretary General said this during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
When asked if the issue was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they had indeed discussed the issue, and also stressed that in his reply he did not mention the timing of Ukraine's accession to NATO.
According to him, any country that wants to join the North Atlantic Alliance must fulfill certain conditions in order to meet specific standards, RT writes.
Crimea offered Zelensky an alternative to NATO course
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, instead of pursuing NATO membership, should focus on establishing good-neighborly relations with Russia.
This was announced on Friday, September 27, by co-chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinets.
"The President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should heed the advice of [US President] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and improve relations with the President of Russia," Chegrinets told RIA Novosti.
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.

Barcelona blackmail Neymar
Spanish "Barcelona" and its former footballer, Brazilian Neymar, are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the striker's move to Paris Saint-Germain in France.
The case almost reached court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without Themis intervening.
Otherwise, they refuse to return him.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also the Brazilian's agent, have an interesting trick: under the agreement with Bar√ßa that the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward ended up at PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Not only that, the Brazilian's lawyers insist that the club also owes him interest for late payment.
When the Catalan capital became aware of Neymar's claims, Barcelona filed a counter-claim.
The Blues insist the bonus was for the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was entitled to only a quarter of the 40 million euros and is demanding the return of a proportional share of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Neymar and Barca almost agreed on the return of the "prodigal" player to the bosom of Catalonia.
True, the deal fell through, but there is still hope for the forward's return.
And now, as reported by Sports.Ru with reference to insiders, the club's lawyers have told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in a pre-trial procedure, it will rule out the possibility of the Brazilian's return.
Neymar himself is so keen to return that he has asked for guarantees that the Catalans will buy him back.

But Laar replied that the Reform Party's goal was to win two seats on the board of the Bank of Estonia - so that, in addition to Jaanus Tamkivi, Andres Sutt would be on the board.
On Tuesday, 24 September, the Riigikogu rejected Laar's proposal to appoint new members to the Board of the Bank of Estonia.

He was also reminded of his numerous betrayals and trips with escorts, and even decided that in this way the musician wanted to be rehabilitated for the scandalous clip "Moscow," which received a record number of dislikes from listeners.

The former midfielder of this club may soon sign a contract with FC Rostov, reports the Championship portal.
According to the publication, negotiations between representatives of "Rostov" and Mamayev are now in the final stage.

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a trolley found in a rubbish heap
A resident of the US city of Oakland Park, Florida, has been arrested on attempted murder charges after brandishing a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute over a trolley found in a garbage can.
Curtis Miller, 54, was digging in a pile of rubbish near an empty house.
Todd Beavers, who was out for an evening walk, noticed this.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black trolley among the rubbish.
Miller saw Beavers' find and was upset.
He thought he could claim the trolley because he was the first to start digging in the rubbish.
The men started arguing.
Suddenly, Beavers grabbed the trolley and ran with it toward his house.
Miller then took the samurai sword he had found in the same pile and pursued his opponent.
He caught up with Beavers outside his home.
Miller grabbed a sword from a knife and began waving it in the direction of the carjacker.
Beavers told Miller that the incident was being videotaped.
After noticing the video camera, Miller fled but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and went inside the house.
Soon after, he saw an unknown woman enter his yard and take the trolley, shouting insults.
Police were already looking for Miller for driving without a license.
A man has been arrested and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that a hedge fund manager attacked a stranger and wounded her with a sword in Hardiston, New Jersey.
This is how he reacted to the fact that guests at the wedding, which was being celebrated in the same hotel where he was staying, did not allow him to smoke.
Riots for Three
The "Moscow case" against the participants of the summer protest actions, the further away, the more noticeably it disintegrates into separate fragments and loses its political content.
The evidence of "mass disorder" itself does not stand up to scrutiny, but in the absence of a political decision to put the brakes on the case, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the dismissal of the charges.
The collapse of the case should encourage the public, but it is certain to leave the security forces, whose efforts to fill the case with defendants and evidence have been in vain, extremely irritated.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disturbances), Aleksei Minyaylo, was unexpectedly released from detention without any obligations, and a few hours later was rehabilitated: the TKR dropped the charges against him.
Minyaylo spent almost two months in detention, and several professional associations - historians, priests, and writers - intervened for him.
After that, only two defendants remained in the case (originally there were 13 defendants): Sergei Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on September 3, and Samariddin Radzhabov, who was the day before extended his arrest until the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a government official, Article 318 of the Criminal Code).
Court convicts author of joke petition on Latvia's accession to the US
The Vidzeme Suburb Court of Riga punished the author of a joke petition on Latvia's accession to the United States of America, Denis Bartecki.
It is noted that the man was assigned 80 hours of correctional labor and one year of probation.
"Common sense is not the greatest strength of our system," Bartetsky commented on the court's decision.
He also added that usually the punishment is less than requested.
The collection of signatures on Latvia's accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, at the same time as this petition, the website collected signatures on Latvia's accession to the "Galactic Empire" and the country's withdrawal from the solar system and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case was initiated against Bartecki under the first paragraph of Article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country - "Public call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia."
Prior to that, in 2016, the author of an online petition for Latvia's accession to Russia received six months in prison.

Russia's Interior Ministry proposes to punish for insulting police officers on the Internet
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia has prepared amendments to the Law "On Police" in order to protect the guardians of order from the dissemination of defamatory and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, a request for public discussion of the bill appeared on the federal portal of normative legal acts, the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honor and dignity of a police officer from "the dissemination in information and communication networks, including the Internet, of defamatory information, including defamatory information."
Exactly how police officers are supposed to be protected from online defamation is not specified.
At the same time, the explanation to the document notes that the provisions of the amendments will be applied "by individualizing the mechanism," already foreseen by the law on blocking posts that offend government officials and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws entered into force in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public debate and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the explanatory memorandum, the amendments to the Law "On Police" should enter into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law punishing "blatant disrespect for the state" on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource of the violation and gives it a day to eliminate it.
For the first violation of the prohibitions, a fine in the amount of 30 to 300 thousand roubles is provided, and for the second violation - administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor applied this rule to the media for the first time, blocking the Yaroslavl edition of 76.ru.
Soon after, the Chudovsky District Court of Novgorod Region fined a local resident 30,000 roubles for having posted online "two records with information in an obscene form that offends human dignity and public morals and expresses clear disrespect for society, the state, and bodies exercising state power in the Russian Federation."

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly understood.
The most famous are pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are well researched and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain age-related diseases (including cardiovascular disease and some cancers).
Known sources of phytoestrogens are all legumes (soybeans are the most popular), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such supplements cannot be a full-fledged substitute for natural hormones.
Possible harm from such supplements cannot be ruled out.
For example, their intake may reduce the production of their own hormones due to the fact that the body receives too many analogues from outside.

"The Wife" must be revived!
He has a huge history and great fans.
I wish them all the best and believe that the city authorities will return their home club to them! "wrote Veretennikov on Instagram.

Hydrometric Center named the right people's signs
In Russia, there are many popular ways in which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometric Center has checked all signs that allegedly work.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can really be trusted, albeit in the short term.
As Roman Wilfand, Scientific Director of the Russian Hydrometallurgical Center, told us, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will really be hot, as our ancestors noticed.
And if the sky is white, the next day there will be rain.
The second working sign is based on bird watching.
People often talk about swallows, if they fly low, it is usually to rain.
The explanation is simple: when the air humidity is high, the moshkar's wings get wet and the birds are forced to descend to hunt insects, TASS writes.
Different continents have their own national characteristics.
Marmite Day is a traditional national holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day it is necessary to observe the marmots climbing out of their burrow to determine the time of the arrival of spring.
Unidentified oil slick found on beaches in northeast Brazil
Oil spills of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
Pollution hotspots were scattered over two thousand kilometers of coastline.
The first oil spills were reported as early as September 2.
But each day until Thursday, their numbers continued to rise, as did their geographical coverage.
The Brazilian Institute for the Environment carried out a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turned out that they were all identical, and it was crude oil.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, to which the samples were submitted for analysis, stated that their composition did not correspond to oil extracted from fields in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after the tanks have been cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it got into the ocean current, "Rogerio Almeida, coordinator of the Petroleum Workers Union of the states of Pernambuco and Para√≠ba, told Brazilian news portal G1.
He added that, despite the ban on the practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the northeast, conservationists found nine sea turtles completely covered in oil film.
Only two of them were rescued.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning up polluted beaches.
In the meantime, the institute's experts recommend that tourists and local residents avoid oil spills and notify about all detected pollution hotspots.

Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev instructed Rospotrebnadzor, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy, and the Ministry of Industry and Trade, together with the business ombudsman and the business community, to revise sanitary and epidemiological rules and norms for catering organizations.
They will also have to study the issue of the transition to the use of the requirements established by the technical regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union in the organization of meals.
The agency's proposals should be submitted to the government no later than October 15, according to the list of Mr. Medvedev's instructions following the results of the September 11 program "Dialogue" on the Rossiya 24 TV channel.
At the same time, Mr. Medvedev instructed all the above-mentioned agencies, in addition to the Ministry of Justice, to submit proposals for conducting, from January 1, 2020, an experiment to limit control measures for catering organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan, and Kaliningrad Oblast.
By November 11, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economy have been instructed to submit to the government a bill with amendments to the Administrative Code on the application of administrative suspension of activities for violation of requirements for the organization of food, which caused harm to health.
In addition, the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Economy, Rospotrebnadzor, and the Ministry of Finance need to work out the issue of a gradual transition from 2021 to the formation of a consumer basket based on a basic set of products that allows for the formation of a full-fledged diet of healthy food.
Recall that the business community started talking about outdated requirements after one cafe from the AnderSon chain was closed.
The business community demanded to cancel the existing SanPiN, Rospotrebnadzor announced the joint development of new ones.
The list includes 33 agencies.
Meanwhile, Rospotrebnadzor intends to reduce the number of sanitary norms and regulations by 40 times by 2021.
Detectives are currently in possession of information about three thefts involving the detainee.
A man armed himself in the Skuratovsky district of Tula.
He stole batteries and automobiles from cars.
Of the two vehicles - VAZ-2106 and VAZ-2107 - the thief took the batteries, presumably for further sale.
"And from another VAZ-2107 car for the same purpose, the intruder took away an automobile and a subwoofer," the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Tula region reported.
The thief probably intended to resell it.
The 26-year-old unemployed man is currently in custody.
Russians have nothing to save for retirement - V. Matvienko
Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that Russians do not have enough savings to make the bill on a guaranteed pension product fully operational in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings is quite common in the world.
Whether its introduction is timely is another matter.
"In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has incomes from which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension provision in the future," V. Matvienko stated.
According to the speaker, Russians cannot understand the mechanisms for the formation and calculation of pensions, because "constant changes in this area have completely confused them."
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system, which regulates its legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we are obliged to do everything to ensure that the size of pensions and the social protection of citizens improve.
But steps in this direction should be considered, responsible, taking into account domestic realities, "V. Matvienko told RIA Novosti.
The Head of the Federal Pension Fund emphasized that if this initiative (the draft law on guaranteed pension product) is to develop, several basic principles must necessarily be provided, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and responsibility of the state for ensuring the safety of pension savings.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that a draft law on a guaranteed pension product (GPP) has been sent for approval.
Among its main elements are an exclusively voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, guarantees of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of citizens "savings accounts by the central administrator, tax benefits for businesses and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man remains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony and Disney reach agreement
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The news of the beloved superhero's departure from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has angered many devoted fans
One of the most famous comic book characters, Spider-Man, will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures have negotiated the rights to use it in franchise films.
This became known from a Sony press release, which says that the third installment of "Spider-Man" with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
It was previously reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach a consensus on a revenue-sharing arrangement that would leave Spider-Man out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony owns the rights to the film character.
It leased them to Disney-owned Marvel movies.
As a result, Sony earned revenue from box office receipts, and Disney from souvenirs and toys.
At some point, it was reported, Disney was no longer comfortable with this arrangement, and the company wanted to renegotiate the agreement.
Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said he was thrilled.
It's amazing that Spider-Man's journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue.
"All of us at Marvel Studios are very excited to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is an iconic figure.
He is a hero whose story affects all generations and audiences around the world, "his press release reads.
At the same time, Faigue reminded that Sony is also creating its own film universe, built just around Spider-Man.
"As it happens, he is the only superpower hero to have appeared in different film universes.
So as long as Sony continues to develop its own Spidey universe, the future could bring unexpected surprises, "he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted on his Instagram account a clip from The Wolf of Wall Street in which Leonardo DiCaprio's character shouts "I'm not leaving!"
Information about the contradictions between the companies emerged in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted half of the box office revenue from the Spider-Man films on the condition that both companies pay half of the production costs.
But that didn't sit well with Sony.
News of the beloved superhero's possible departure from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has angered many devoted fans.
Details of the new terms have not yet been released.
According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the agreement, but said, "We have worked well together for the last four years, and our shared desire to continue working together was commensurate with the wishes of many [Spider-Man] fans.
We're excited to be able to move forward together. '
Avengers: Infinity War, which brought together Spider-Man, Thor, the Hulk, and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest-grossing film in world cinema history, ousting Avatar from first place.

Trade with Russia Is Not Just Tanks
Trade between Russia and India could double thanks to the geopolitical situation.
Deputy Director of the Confederation of Indian Industry Manish Kumar spoke about this at the V Anniversary Forum of Small and Medium-Sized Businesses of the SCO and BRICS regions.
It is important for us to learn from the SCO and BRICS countries, including Russia, stressed the guest from Delhi.
- Our confederation has 9,000 direct members and 300,000 partner companies from 130 countries.
All of these are small and medium-sized businesses that cooperate with the countries of the Shanghai Organization.
And we are not standing still, but developing, and all these sanctions against Russia and the geopolitical situation in general only help us all to grow.
Our bilateral trade now exceeds $10 billion, but that figure could be doubled.
First and foremost, through new technologies in health care, artificial intelligence, and robotics.
Our trade is not just tanks and heavy industry.
According to Manish Kumar, India has already established the first contacts with modern centers of Russia.
For example, a delegation from Delhi and other cities recently visited Skolkovo and Innopolis.
We signed a memorandum on the creation of systems in which it will be possible to build your modern business.
After all, entrepreneurship is not a whim, but a necessity.
We need a step toward economic prosperity.
We need to expand and attract small and medium-sized businesses, and together with Russia, China and other countries, we will certainly do so, "the Indian industrialist stressed.
Recall that Ufa is hosting the Forum of Small and Medium-Sized Businesses of the SCO and BRICS regions for the fifth time in a row.
From 25 to 27 September, more than 2,800 people from Russia and 31 other countries took part in the forum.
As part of his working trip to Tobolsk, the Governor of Tyumen Region, Alexander Moore, took part in the grand opening of the Sokolovsky water intake after reconstruction.
Now its capacity is 25 thousand cubic meters per day.
Reconstruction of the water intake took place within the framework of the implementation of the federal project "Clean Water" under the national project "Ecology."
Investors helped the authorities: Sokolovsky's water intake was another example of the use of public-private partnerships.
Tyumen Oblast has a unique experience of interaction in this area between federal structures, regional authorities, local administrations and private investors.
New artesian wells have appeared at the site.
Above them, pumping stations were built.
Water purification and disinfection facilities have been reconstructed.
As a result, Sokolovsky's water intake will provide residents of Tobolsk with quality drinking water.
Sokolovsky and Zhukovsky water intakes are planned.
Then Tobolsk will be fully able to switch to underground water sources.

Trump's conversation with Zelensky seen as' Russian footprint 'in Congress
In the lower house of the US Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of involvement in the scandal caused by a telephone conversation between White House chief Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.
The suggestion that the "Russians" might somehow be behind the story was made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, MSNBC News reports.
"I believe Russia had a hand in this," the Democrat said, but declined to comment further.
Pelosi-led Democrats, who hold a majority in the House, had earlier announced the launch of impeachment proceedings against the president.
This came after an intelligence informant complained about Trump.
The informant suspected that in a conversation with Zelensky in July, Trump pressured his interlocutor to bring the case against the son of former Vice President Joseph Biden, who could be Trump's running mate in a year's time.
The White House had to provide members of Congress and the public with a transcript of the controversial conversation.

Expert reveals why it's worth giving up tea bags
A group of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that brewing a tea bag in a cup in five minutes gets more than ten billion microplastic particles.
Sawdust particles can also be added to a packaged drink, food safety expert Elizabeth Tikhonova told Nation News.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of the tea bag - the producer can add ingredients that will not be indicated on the packaging.
Sawdust is not thrown away at the end of the season, so it can end up in tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in tea bags," Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to give up such a drink in favor of weight-loss tea, which is sold in specialty stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles are heated to high temperatures, which can cause them to release harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - such a drink will have the least additives," the expert pointed out.

Regions offered to share secrets of business support
As the Parliamentary Gazette learned, on September 27, Andrei Kutepov, Chairman of the Economic Policy Committee of the Federation Council, sent a letter to Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express a position on the initiatives of the constituent entities of the Federation to improve legislation in the area of support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It's Time to Build Interregional Connections
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on their existing business development and legalization programs for the self-employed, as well as the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the current legislation.
"To date, communication between the regions has not been sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the senators" visit highlighted the lack of information on regional entrepreneurship development programs in the country as a whole, "Andrei Kutepov stated.
In the annex to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive practices of the regions on legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problems (available to the editorial board).
In addition to the relevant ministries, summary data from the regions have also been sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
Sharing information on good practices in the regions could give a boost to entrepreneurship in general.
The first step to such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Economic Policy Committee, "the senator told the Parliamentary Gazette.
Lessons learned
Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully operate programs to support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, in Vologda Oblast, there is an Entrepreneurship Support Centre, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in certifying finished products.
In Ivanovo Oblast, a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the one-stop-shop principle through multifunctional centers.
In Krasnodar Krai, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives receive grants from the regional budget.
There is a cluster development centre in Oryol Oblast.
Amur Oblast, within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of Small and Medium-Sized Entrepreneurs," provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state co-working centers at the expense of the federal budget.
And in a number of other regions, special measures are being taken to support youth entrepreneurship.
The self-employed continue to be dragged out of the shadows
According to the regional authorities, in order to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation.
For example, Arkhangelsk Oblast proposed replacing the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity," as this "most closely corresponds to the content of the state service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens."
Ivanovo Oblast considers it necessary to introduce amendments providing for the expansion of the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for the decoration and repair of dwellings, dacha buildings, and physical training classes.
Bryansk Oblast considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the Mercury veterinary system.
And in Kostroma and Magadan regions, there is a call for strengthening the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and areas of support for social entrepreneurship in the regulatory and legal framework.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills," Andrei Kutepov assured.
Airline helped passengers avoid being surrounded by crying children
Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new feature: when booking seats on a plane, you can now find out where young children will sit.
Now you can avoid them if you want.
Japan Airlines (JAL) passengers have been able to take advantage of the new option and avoid unwanted proximity with young children.
The airline has launched a feature that allows you to track where children will sit.
When selecting seats during the booking process, passengers will be able to see an image of a child's head in seats occupied by children aged between eight days and two years.
In this way, those who do not want to fly close to the babies because of the possible inconvenience of their crying can sit as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the airline's services were delighted with the innovation.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One user complained that he was flying from New York to Doha a few weeks ago and had three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested introducing "adult-only flights," expressing willingness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists noted that they will now always try to choose Japan Airlines for their travel, as they see nothing nice about flying next to a crying child in a closed space.
Earlier, a woman traveling with an infant tried to appease fellow passengers on a Seoul-San Francisco flight.
She prepared a bag of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each with a note of apology.

Pavel Ustinov joined the pickets in support of the defendants in the "Moscow case"
Actor Pavel Ustinov joined a series of single pickets "Freedom for All," which are taking place on Friday at the Presidential Administration building in Staraya Square in Moscow, Interfax reports.
A series of pickets began on September 18 in support of Ustinov himself and has continued every day since.
At present, the participants of the action stand in turn, holding a placard with the inscription "Freedom for all" and the names of those convicted and arrested after uncoordinated rallies in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, the poster names Yegor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Danil Beglets, Evgeny Kovalenko, Konstantin Kotov, Ivan Podkopaev, Aydar Gubaidulin, Alexei Minaylo, Sergei Fomin, Samariddin Radzhabov, Nikita Chirtsov, Eduard Malyshevsky, Vladislav Sinitsa.
On September 16, the Tver Court of Moscow sentenced 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years in a general regime penal colony on charges of using violence against a member of the riot police of the Federal Guard at an uncoordinated action on August 3 in the center of Moscow (Part 2 of Article 318 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
Then, on September 20, at the request of the Prosecutor General's Office, the court changed Ustinov's preventive measure from detention to a travel ban.
Thus, a petition for Ustinov's release gathered more than 112,000 signatures in 24 hours.
Theatre and film artists started a flash mob in support of their colleague.
To participate in a single picket in solidarity with the actor on September 18, a line was formed in the Old Square.
Human rights activists, journalists, scientists, teachers, doctors, and Orthodox priests demanded a review of the case.

Supplies of "sanctions" to Russia have fallen 100-fold
The Russian government estimates that the supply of agricultural products and foodstuffs to Russia from countries subject to the Russian food embargo has decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries in the first half of 2019, compared to 3 million 442.2 thousand tons in the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.
At the same time, the value of imported products fell to $226.5 million from $4,975.5 million, respectively.
This refers to the supply of goods that are not subject to the embargo.
According to the report, the volume of products banned from import was compensated by an increase in imports from the CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Serbia.
Recall that at the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs, which are prohibited for import into Russia under counter-sanctions.
The document, posted on the official portal of legal information, noted that the validity of the rules has been extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the order to destroy the sanctions applied to products from the US, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein "joined" this list, and on January 1, 2016, Ukraine.
A decree signed by Putin to destroy illegally imported "sanctions" (products under a food embargo that Moscow imposed in response to Western anti-Russian sanctions) came into force in 2015.
In return, the government allowed the destruction of "sanctioned" foodstuffs by any legal means.
As Western sanctions continued, Russia also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, Mikhail Fedotov, Head of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, has previously called the destruction of food "simply immoral," which, according to him, has a negative impact on people's education.
Moreover, at the beginning of June, Rospotrebnadzor took the initiative to ban the destruction of foodstuffs fit for consumption.
The Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation then made a similar recommendation to the government.
And Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Alexei Gordeev stated that it is wrong to destroy food products, and it is necessary to think about how they can be used for their intended purpose, evaluating the quality.

By 2023, the first school of a new format will open in the center of the capital
A new school will be opened in Khamovniki.
According to the head of Moskomstroyinvest, Anastasia Pyatova, all conditions will be created there for the self-realization and development of children's talents.
The educational institution was decided to be called "New Look."
This project will be overseen by the Moscow State Institute of International Relations of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Higher School Economic Development Foundation.
It is planned to start designing the building with an area of about 10,000 "squares" as early as next year.
Construction will be completed at the end of 2022, and the first apprentices will begin to be recruited next year.
"The project provides for the creation of a publicly accessible, non-profit educational space, which will be based on the traditions of a classical Moscow school and experimental methods," the press service of Moskomstroyinvest noted.
Chile begins construction of ‚Ç¨1 billion telescope
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, construction officially began this week on the dome of the building that will house the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope) telescope, so far the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomy project.
Its total cost, according to ESO estimates, will exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking mirror, which will have a diameter of about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 metres.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflective surfaces with diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT obtain the first detailed photos of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and search for Earth's twin.
In addition, scientists will try to use the observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A *, a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that construction of the dome has only just begun, the mirrors, scientific instruments, and other components of the observatory have been developed by scientists, engineers, and other specialists for three years, since the first plans for the E-ELT were announced.
Germany's SCHOTT and France's Safran Reosc were awarded the contract for the production of the main mirror, with a combined value of around ‚Ç¨400 million.
