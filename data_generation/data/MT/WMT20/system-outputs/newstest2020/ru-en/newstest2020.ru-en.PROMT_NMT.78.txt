How?
If we knew, we probably would have fixed it by now.
But first of all, it seems to me, we need to add in such component as single combats.
In my opinion, we have problems with this.

China strongly opposes US adoption of the Taipei Bill
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called "Taipei Bill," which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of three Sino-American joint communiqu√©s.
This was announced on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of China for Taiwan, Ma Xiaoguang.
The approval of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations of this bill is also a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations and gross interference in the internal affairs of China, said Ma Xiaoguang.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and related issues relate to China's internal affairs.
"We urge the American side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwanese issue in order to avoid further damage to Sino-American relations, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," he said.
China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone and no forces, Ma Xiaoguang emphasized.
TikTok hides objectionable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under 18 years old
Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong, the Guardian says.
The documents found at the publication say that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) using the application promotes the goals of China's foreign policy abroad.
Most of the violations related to Chinese policy fall under the "incitement to hatred."
In each case, TikTok places objectionable publications in a context suitable for general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general ban of "criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc."
The ban on mentioning Tiananmen Square incidents or genocide in Cambodia falls under the "distortion of the history of China or other countries."
The document also contains a list of banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen," including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, American presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park KyDand Prime Renee, President Indonesia Indonesia
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.
Publications from the first category are deleted by social network administrators and may lead to user blocking.
Not too strict violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: "Now we use a localized approach for moderation, and also attract independent local specialists."
Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on publications, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Production Center.
The Production Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially collaborates with TikTok.
The Production Center coordinates all advertising materials of bloggers with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without approval, Bogdanov reports.
When asked whether TikTok can speak out about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he has seen such publications.
Roman Zaripov, founder of Our Didgital, agrees with Bogdanov: "TikTok lists the basic rules for users in the user agreement: you can't post shocking content, discriminating statements, and so on."
But under these rules you can bring any content that moderators do not like, Zaripov notes.
Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under 18 years old.
By user agreement, only persons over 13 years old can use TikTok.
Social network administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how many years a person looks like, Bogdanov says.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, their account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.

Russians warned of fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters that replace the bank's telephone number has increased.
It is reported by Kommersant, citing data from the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator handed over to telecom operators information about more than 2.5 thousand numbers from which they called customers of various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, operators found a number substitution.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases they established a restriction on the use of financial services.
Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the Central Bank Artem Sychev said that a wide range of Russian banks faced a number substitution.
He explained that operators do not always respond to warnings from the Central Bank about fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such an obligation in the law "On Communications."
Otkritie Bank, Rosbank and Alfa Bank confirmed information about an increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a number change.
According to the press service of Bilain, part of the information about fraudulent calls that the Central Bank transmitted was incorrect: the lists included numbers that banks really use to communicate with customers.
Blocking them would cause disruptions to the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudsters' numbers, to which the telecom operator will contact each call to check the number.
He explained that the creation of such a base would require amendments to the legislation.

In September, Roskomnadzor revealed political advertising in the services of Google, Facebook and Youtube.
According to the agency, this happened during the Russian elections on September 8.
The facts of violations were submitted to the State Duma commission.
Google later said that the company supports responsible political advertising.

Stoltenberg discussed with Zelensky Ukraine's entry into NATO
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership in the alliance on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The Secretary General said this during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
Answering the question whether the relevant topic was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they really discussed this issue, and also emphasized that in his response he did not name the timing of Ukraine's entry into NATO.
According to him, any country that would like to join the North Atlantic Alliance is obliged to fulfill certain conditions in order to meet specific standards, writes RT.
In Crimea, offered Zelensky an alternative to a course in NATO
Instead of heading for NATO membership, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should work to establish good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
This was announced on Friday, September 27, by the co-chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinets.
"The Pan President of Ukraine does not need to repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should heed the advice of [US President] Donald Trump, who he listened to with a sour face, and establish relations with the President of Russia," Chegrinets told RIA Novosti reporters.
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will only be able to stay in power if relations with the Russian Federation are established.
Earlier on September 27, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that he had a conversation with Zelensky on the country's entry into the alliance.
According to him, for this Ukraine is obliged to fulfill certain conditions.
On June 5, Rada deputy Yevgeny Balitsky said that the possible entry of Ukraine into the alliance does not guarantee an improvement in life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
"Barcelona" blackmails Neymar
Spanish "Barcelona" and its former footballer Brazilian Neymar are trying to resolve the financial dispute that arose after the striker moved to the French "Paris Saint-Germain."
The case almost went to trial, but the Catalans invited the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Themis.
Otherwise, they refuse him to return.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, started an interesting focus: by agreement with Barca, which the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the striker ended up at PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Moreover, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club also owes him interest on late payment.
When Neymar's claims became known in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona sent a counterclaim.
Blue Garnet insists that the bonus relied on the implementation of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was supposed to be only a quarter of 40 million euros and require the return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barca almost agreed to return the "prodigal" player to the fold of Catalonia.
True, the deal fell through, but the hope of a reverse forward transition remains.
And so, according to Sports.Ru, citing insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in pre-trial order, this will exclude the possibility of the Brazilian returning.
Neymar himself so wants to return that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans would buy him back.

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a cart found in a garbage pile
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after he swung a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute over a cart found in garbage.
54-year-old Curtis Miller dug in a lot of garbage near the empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers, who went on an evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the discards.
Miller saw Beavers' find and was upset.
He believed that he could claim a cart, as he was the first to dig into the garbage.
The men started arguing.
Suddenly Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with it towards his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and began to pursue the opponent.
He caught up with Beavers outside his house.
Miller grabbed the sword from his knives and began waving it in the direction of the cart kidnapper.
Beavers told Miller that what was happening was recorded on video.
Noticing the video camera, Miller escaped, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and went into the house.
Soon after, he saw that an unfamiliar woman entered his yard and took the cart, shouting insults.
The police were already looking for Miller for driving without a license.
The man was detained, he was charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked an unfamiliar woman and wounded her with a sword.
Thus, he reacted to the fact that the guests at the wedding, which was celebrated in the same hotel where he stayed, did not let him smoke.
Riots for three
The "Moscow case" against participants in summer protests the further, the more noticeably it falls into separate fragments and loses political content.
Evidence of the very fact of "riots" cannot stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to lower this case on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the dismissal of charges.
The collapse of the case should inspire society, but it will probably leave in extreme annoyance the security forces, whose efforts to fill the case with defendants and evidence turned out to be in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three defendants remaining in the case under Art. 212 of the Criminal Code (riots) - Alexei Minyaylo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and after a few hours he was completely rehabilitated: the TFR dropped the charges against him.
Minyaylo spent almost two months under arrest, several professional communities stood up for him at once: historians, priests, writers.
After that, only two accused of participating in the riots remained in the case (initially there were 13 accused): Sergey Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on September 3, and Samariddin Rajabov, who was extended the arrest the day before the court until the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a representative of the authorities, article 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court sentenced the author of a comic petition on Latvia's accession to the United States
The court of the Vidzeme suburb of Riga sentenced the author of the comic petition for Latvia's accession to the United States of America Denis Bartetsky.
It is noted that the man was assigned 80 hours of correctional labor and one year of probation.
"Common sense is not the strongest side of our system," Bartetsky commented on the court decision.
He also added that usually the punishment is less than requested.
The collection of signatures on Latvia's accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, at the same time as this petition, signatures were collected on the site about Latvia's accession to the Galactic Empire and about the country's withdrawal from the solar system and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case was instituted against Bartetsky under the first paragraph of Article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country - "Public call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia."
Prior to this, in 2016, the author of an online petition for Latvia to join Russia received six months in prison.

On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill appeared on the federal portal of regulatory legal acts, the draft document itself has not yet been published.

How exactly it is supposed to protect police from defamation on the network is not specified.
At the same time, the explanation of the document notes that the provisions of the amendments will be applied "by individualizing the mechanism" already provided for by the law on blocking posts that offend government officials and the law on fines for such posts.

The final text of the bill will be published after public discussions and an independent anti-corruption examination.
According to the explanatory note, amendments to the law "On Police" should enter into force in January 2020.

For the first violation of the prohibitions, a fine of 30 to 300 thousand rubles is provided, and for repeated violation - administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor first applied this norm to the media, blocking the Yaroslavl edition of 76.ru.
Soon after, the Chudovsky District Court of the Novgorod Region fined a local resident 30 thousand rubles for posting on the network "two records with information in indecent form that offends human dignity and public morals and expresses a clear disrespect for society, the state, and bodies exercising state power in the Russian Federation."

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
Of the most famous - pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (among them cardiovascular, some types of cancer).
Famous sources of phytoestrogens are all legumes (the most popular is soybeans), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such dietary supplements cannot be a full-fledged replacement for natural hormones.
Possible harm from such additives cannot be ruled out.
For example, against the background of their intake, the production of their own hormones may decrease due to the fact that too many analogues from the outside enter the body.

The Bastion complex launched the Onyx rocket in Chukotka
For the first time, the Ministry of Defense launched a cruise missile from the Bastion complex in Chukotka.

The hydrometeorological center called the correct folk signs
In Russia, there are many popular acceptances by which people are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometeorological Center checked all the signs that allegedly work.
Meteorologists came to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, however, in the short term.
As the supervisor of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia Roman Vilfand said, if the sun is red during sunset, then the next day will really be dead, as our ancestors noticed.
And if the heavenly shine is whitish, then the next day it will rain.
The second working sign is based on bird surveillance.
More often they talk about swallows, if they fly low, then this is usually to rain.
This is explained simply - when the humidity of the air is high, then the wings wash at the moskhara and the birds are forced to decline in order to hunt insects, writes TASS.
On different continents there are their own popular signs.
Groundhog Day is a traditional folk holiday in the USA and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day you need to watch a groundhog climbing out of its hole to determine the time of arrival of spring.
Unidentified oil spots found on beaches in northeast Brazil

Pollution centers were scattered over two thousand kilometers of coastline.
Reports of the first oil spots discovered began to arrive on September second.
However, every day until Thursday, their number, like territorial coverage, continued to increase.

"This is thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it got to the oceanic current", - the coordinator of labor union of workers of oil industry of states Pernambuco and Paraiba Rozherio Almeida told the Brazilian news G1 portal.
He also added that, despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the northeast of the country, environmental advocates found nine sea turtles completely covered with oil film.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environmental Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the institute's experts recommend that tourists and local residents bypass the oil slicks and notify of all detected contamination centers.

Russians have nothing to retire from - V. Matvienko
Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have enough savings to make the bill on a guaranteed pension product work in full force in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions due to personal savings is quite common in the world.
Another thing is how timely its introduction is with us.
"In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has incomes, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension provision in the future," V. Matvienko said.
The Russians, according to the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms for the formation and accrual of pensions, since "constant changes in this area have finally confused them."
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system governing its legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to ensure that the size of pensions and the social security of citizens improve.
But steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities, "V. Matvienko told RIA Novosti.
The head of the Federation Council emphasized that if this initiative (the bill on a guaranteed pension product) develops, then several basic principles must be provided, including volunteerism, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and state responsibility for ensuring the safety of pension savings.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the sending of a bill on a guaranteed pension product (GPP) for approval.
Among its main elements are the exclusively voluntary procedure for joining citizens to the savings system, guaranteeing the safety of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of savings accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.

Sony and Disney agreed
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The news of the departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel film universe caused anger among many loyal fans
One of the most famous comic book heroes - Spider-Man - will remain in the Marvel film universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures managed to agree on the rights to use it in franchise films.
This became known from a Sony press release, which says that the third part of Spider-Man with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
Earlier it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to a consensus on the division of revenues, which is why Spider-Man will leave the Marvel film universe.
The rights to the movie hero are owned by Sony.
She leased them for Marvel films, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony received revenue from revenue in film cashiers, and Disney - from souvenirs and toys.
As reported, at some point such a situation ceased to suit Disney, and the company wanted to revise the agreement.
Marvel Studios President Kevin Feigi said he was delighted.
It's amazing that Spidey [Spider-Man] 's journey in the Marvel film universe will continue.
"All of us at Marvel Studios are very happy to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is an iconic figure.
This is a hero whose story affects all generations and viewers around the world, "his press release said.
At the same time, Feigi recalled that Sony is also creating its own film universe, built just around Spider-Man.
"It so happened that he is the only superpower-endowed hero who finds himself in different film generations.
So, while Sony continues to develop its own Spidy Universe, the future may present unexpected surprises, "he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, obviously commenting on the news, posted on his Instagram account an excerpt from The Wolf of Wall Street, in which the hero Leonardo di Caprio shouts "I'm not leaving!"
Information about contradictions between companies appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to receive half of the box office revenue from Spider-Man films, provided that both companies would pay half of the costs of producing paintings.
But this did not suit Sony.
The news of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel film universe caused anger among many loyal fans.
Details of the new terms have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the agreement, but said: "We have collaborated perfectly over the past four years, and our joint desire to continue working together was commensurate with the wishes of many fans of [Spider-Man].
We are glad that we can go forward together. "
The film "Avengers: The Finale," combining Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest grossing in the history of world cinema, removing Avatar from first place.

The expert told why it is worth giving up tea in bags
A group of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that when a bag of tea is brewed, more than ten billion particles of microplastic get into a cup in five minutes.
Sawdust particles can also be added to the packaged drink, food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova told Nation News.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients there that will not be indicated on the package.
Sawdust at the end of the season is not thrown away, so they may end up in tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in the bags," Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to abandon the use of such a drink in favor of tea for weighing, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she emphasized that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles are heated to high temperatures, because of which they can begin to release harmful substances.
"It is best to purchase clean green or black tea - in such a drink there will be the least additives," the expert said.

Regions offered to share secrets of business support
As it became known to the Parliamentary newspaper, on September 27, Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Andrei Kutepov sent a letter to Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express a position on initiatives of the subjects of the Federation to improve legislation in the field of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It is time to establish interregional ties
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on the business development and legalization programs of the self-employed, as well as on the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the current legislation.
"Today, communication between the regions is not well established, as a result of which the entrepreneurial community in all regions visited by senators identified the lack of information about regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the whole country," said Andrei Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive achievements of regions on the legalization of self-employment and consolidated data from regions with proposals and issues (available to the editors).
In addition to relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions were also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positive achievements in the regions could give an impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy, "the senator told the Parliamentary newspaper.
Useful experience

In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar Territory, novice agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants at the expense of the regional budget.

The Amur Region, within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises," provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state coworking centers at the expense of the federal budget.
And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to be brought out of the shadows
According to regional authorities, in order to more effectively support small and medium-sized businesses, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed replacing the tent "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity," since this "most corresponds to the content of the state service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens."
In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to amend the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for the decoration and repair of residential premises, country buildings, and physical training classes.
The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers using the Mercury veterinary system.
And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions, they are advocating the consolidation in the regulatory field of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the areas of support for social entrepreneurship.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account when preparing state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account when preparing state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills," Andrei Kutepov assured.

Initially, the decree on the destruction of the sanction extended to products from the USA, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein "joined" this list, from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine.
A decree signed by Putin on the destruction of "sanctions" illegally imported into the country (products that fell under the food embargo, which Moscow imposed in response to Western anti-Russian sanctions) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the government allowed the destruction of "sanctions" food in any legal way.
As Western sanctions persist, the Russian Federation also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, previously called the destruction of food products "simply immoral," and this, according to him, negatively affects the education of people.
Moreover, Rospotrebnadzor took the initiative to ban the destruction of food suitable for consumption in early June.
After that, the Presidential Human Rights Council made a similar recommendation to the government.
And Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that destroying food is wrong, and you need to think about how you can use it for your purpose, assessing the quality.

In Chile, began to build a telescope worth 1 billion euros
This was reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, this week the construction of the dome of the building, where the E-ELT telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope - "European Ultra-Large Telescope") will be located, is still the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project.
Its total value, according to ESO estimates, will exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflecting surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT get the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, as well as search for Earth's doubles.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A *, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has only just begun, scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory for three years - since the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT were announced.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total value was about 400 million euros, was received by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
